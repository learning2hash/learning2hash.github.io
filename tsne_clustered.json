However, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes, which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed, most of them are time-consuming. In addition, most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization, making them unscalable. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method\u2014Scalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing, SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition, it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm, it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover, the binary codes can be generated discretely, reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely, Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, and NUS-WIDE, have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Cross Modal", "Quantisation", "Supervised", "Supervised"], "tsne_embedding": [-10.608524322509766, -6.666861534118652], "cluster": 0}, {"key": "a2016ensemble", "year": "2016", "citations": "8", "title": "An Ensemble Diversity Approach To Supervised Binary Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Binary hashing is a well-known approach for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in information retrieval.

Next, we use Approximate Nearest Neighbor search in a classification-by-retrieval approach. Our framework allows for training a fast, lightweight classification model using only a few examples of normal API requests. We evaluated the performance of our framework using the CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023 datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework improves API attack detection accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) unsupervised anomaly detection baselines.</p>\n", "tags": ["Retrieval Models", "Unimodal", "Shallow", "Datasets", "Vector Indexing", "Supervised", "Training Strategy"], "tsne_embedding": [-9.558497428894043, -35.589744567871094], "cluster": 6}, {"key": "ahle2015complexity", "year": "2015", "citations": "22", "title": "On The Complexity Of Inner Product Similarity Join", "abstract": "<p>A number of tasks in classification, information retrieval, recommendation\nsystems, and record linkage reduce to the core problem of inner product\nsimilarity join (IPS join): identifying pairs of vectors in a collection that\nhave a sufficiently large inner product.

In fact, for any k \\in [log* n], it is possible to achieve\nO(k)-time insertions/deletions, O(1)-time queries, and O(log^{(k)} n) wasted\nbits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that, each time we\nincrease insertion/deletion time by an <em>additive constant</em>, we reduce the\nwasted bits per key <em>exponentially</em>. We further show that this tradeoff\ncurve is the best achievable by any of a large class of hash tables, including\nany hash table designed using the current framework for making constant-time\nhash tables succinct.</p>\n", "tags": ["Independent", "Retrieval Models", "Unimodal", "Shallow", "Hashing"], "tsne_embedding": [-50.923282623291016, 28.440481185913086], "cluster": 2}, {"key": "bengio2009group", "year": "2009", "citations": "178", "title": "Group Sparse Coding", "abstract": "<p>Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text, image and video processing.

In the index-building stage, we adopt a hierarchical balanced clustering algorithm to balance the length of posting lists and augment the posting list by adding the points in the closure of the corresponding clusters. In the search stage, we use a query-aware scheme to dynamically prune the access of unnecessary posting lists.  Experiment results demonstrate that SPANN is 2X faster than the state-of-the-art ANNS solution DiskANN to reach the same recall quality 90% with same memory cost in three billion-scale datasets.

Next, we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search.

Existing literature addresses this challenge for image datasets through vector representations jointly trained on natural language and images.

We embed a spatial-attention module into the\nnetwork structure of our ATH to focus on ROI information. The spatial-attention\nmodule aggregates the spatial information of feature maps by utilizing\nmax-pooling, element-wise maximum, and element-wise mean operations jointly\nalong the channel axis. The triplet cross-entropy loss can help to map the\nclassification information of images and similarity between images into the\nhash codes. Extensive experiments on two case-based medical datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed ATH can further improve the retrieval performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods and boost the ranking\nperformance for small samples.

As a result, this framework effectively\novercomes the limitation of using metric distances and can address situations\ninvolving cosine similarity or other non-standard similarity measures.\nExperimental results using k-medoids clustering in GDASC with real datasets\nconfirm the applicability of this approach for approximate similarity search,\nimproving the performance of extant algorithms for this purpose.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Unsupervised"], "tsne_embedding": [-30.045412063598633, -6.46922492980957], "cluster": 8}, {"key": "garciamorato2024parametrizable", "year": "2024", "citations": "0", "title": "A Parametrizable Algorithm For Distributed Approximate Similarity Search With Arbitrary Distances", "abstract": "<p>Recent studies have explored alternative distance measures for similarity\nsearch in spaces with diverse topologies, emphasizing the importance of\nselecting an appropriate distance function to improve the performance of\nk-Nearest Neighbour search algorithms.

On the billion point SIFT1B bigann dataset, DiskANN\nserves &gt; 5000 queries a second with &lt; 3ms mean latency and 95%+ 1-recall@1\non a 16 core machine, where state-of-the-art billion-point ANNS algorithms with\nsimilar memory footprint like FAISS and IVFOADC+G+P plateau at\naround 50% 1-recall@1. Alternately, in the high recall regime, DiskANN can\nindex and serve 5 \u2212 10x more points per node compared to state-of-the-art graph-\nbased methods such as HNSW and NSG. Finally, as part of our overall\nDiskANN system, we introduce Vamana, a new graph-based ANNS index that is\nmore versatile than the graph indices even for in-memory indices.</p>\n", "tags": ["Graph", "NEURIPS"], "tsne_embedding": [-22.708223342895508, 41.266326904296875], "cluster": 4}, {"key": "jayaram2024data", "year": "2024", "citations": "0", "title": "Data-dependent LSH For The Earth Mover's Distance", "abstract": "<p>We give new data-dependent locality sensitive hashing schemes (LSH) for the\nEarth Mover\u2019s Distance (\\(\\mathsf{EMD}\\)), and as a result, improve the best\napproximation for nearest neighbor search under \\(\\mathsf{EMD}\\) by a quadratic\nfactor.

First, match pairs are selected by using an image retrieval technique, which converts images into global descriptors and searches high-dimension nearest neighbors with graph indexing.

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval.

To resolve this dilemma, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH), which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part, we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part, a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore, the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes, hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. To solve the resulting optimization problem, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based iterative algorithm is elaborately designed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale data sets indicate the promising performance of the proposed LSAH.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Graph", "Image Retrieval", "Supervised", "Supervised"], "tsne_embedding": [-5.3043365478515625, 21.91714096069336], "cluster": 9}, {"key": "lu2024online", "year": "2024", "citations": "115", "title": "Online Multi-modal Hashing With Dynamic Query-adaption", "abstract": "<p>Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval, due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover, to accurately capture the query variations, at the online retrieval stage, we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents.

This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover, the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method, we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites, Tencent Weibo, and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE).

Besides powerful machine learning tools for\nclassification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is\nthe <em>audio content representation</em>.\n  Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio\nsignal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient\n(low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music\nrepositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time\ninteraction with a user supplying new songs to the system.\n  Before designing new audio features, we explore the usage of traditional\nlocal features, while adding a stage of encoding with a pre-computed\n<em>codebook</em> and a stage of pooling to get compact vectorial\nrepresentations. We experiment with different encoding methods, namely\n<em>the LASSO</em>, <em>vector quantization (VQ)</em> and <em>cosine similarity\n(CS)</em>. We evaluate the representations\u2019 quality in two music information\nretrieval applications: query-by-tag and query-by-example. Our results show\nthat concise representations can be used for successful performance in both\napplications.

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples. Extensive empirical results on three widely-used image retrieval datasets show that (i) our method consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods using hash codes of the same length and (ii) our method can use significantly (e.g., 50%-75%) shorter hash codes to perform substantially better than, or comparably well to, the competing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Image Retrieval", "Independent"], "tsne_embedding": [-4.939629554748535, -18.110538482666016], "cluster": 6}, {"key": "yandex2024yandex", "year": "2024", "citations": "0", "title": "Yandex DEEP-1B", "abstract": "<p>Yandex DEEP-1B image descriptor dataset consisting of the projected and normalized outputs from the last fully-connected layer of the GoogLeNet model, which was pretrained on the Imagenet classification task.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Supervised"], "tsne_embedding": [60.17207717895508, -1.202907681465149], "cluster": 3}, {"key": "yandexdeep1B", "year": "2021", "citations": "0", "title": "Yandex DEEP-1B", "abstract": "<p>Yandex DEEP-1B image descriptor dataset consisting of the projected and normalized outputs from the last fully-connected layer of the GoogLeNet model, which was pretrained on the Imagenet classification task.</p>\n", "tags": ["Dataset"], "tsne_embedding": [60.17207717895508, -1.202907681465149], "cluster": 3}, {"key": "yandextexttoimage1B", "year": "2021", "citations": "0", "title": "Yandex Text-to-Image-1B", "abstract": "<p>Yandex Text-to-Image-1B is a new cross-model dataset (text and visual), where database and query vectors have different distributions in a shared representation space.

For obtaining \\(k\\)-bit binary codes from\n\\(d\\)-dimensional data, this improves the time complexity from \\(O(dk)\\) to\n\\(O(dlog{d})\\), and the space complexity from \\(O(dk)\\) to \\(O(d)\\).\n  We study two settings, which differ in the way we choose the parameters of\nthe circulant matrix. In the first, the parameters are chosen randomly and in\nthe second, the parameters are learned using the data. For randomized CBE, we\ngive a theoretical analysis comparing it with binary embedding using an\nunstructured random projection matrix. The challenge here is to show that the\ndependencies in the entries of the circulant matrix do not lead to a loss in\nperformance. In the second setting, we design a novel time-frequency\nalternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which\nalternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. In both\nthe settings, we show by extensive experiments that the CBE approach gives much\nbetter performance than the state-of-the-art approaches if we fix a running\ntime, and provides much faster computation with negligible performance\ndegradation if we fix the number of bits in the embedding.</p>\n", "tags": ["Independent", "Unimodal", "Shallow", "Training Strategy", "Hashing"], "tsne_embedding": [-44.982418060302734, 13.42846393585205], "cluster": 2}, {"key": "yu2016variable", "year": "2016", "citations": "0", "title": "Variable-length Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Hashing has emerged as a popular technique for large-scale similarity search.\nMost learning-based hashing methods generate compact yet correlated hash codes.\nHowever, this redundancy is storage-inefficient.

Specifically, our\nmethod directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation, where the network can be\ntrained directly via policy gradient.

However,\nconventional techniques often face challenges in balancing both accuracy and\nscalability simultaneously. To overcome these existing problems, a surge of\ndeep learning-based work has been recently proposed. Unfortunately, many\nresearchers still find it extremely difficult to conduct relevant studies or\nextend existing approaches. First, prior work typically relies on proprietary\nbenchmark without making the entire dataset publicly accessible. Consequently,\na large-scale, well-labeled dataset for binary code similarity analysis remains\nprecious and scarce. Moreover, previous work has primarily focused on comparing\nat the function level, rather than exploring other finer granularities.\nTherefore, we argue that the lack of a fine-grained dataset for BCSA leaves a\ncritical gap in current research. To address these challenges, we construct a\nbenchmark dataset for fine-grained binary code similarity analysis called\nBinSimDB, which contains equivalent pairs of smaller binary code snippets, such\nas basic blocks. Specifically, we propose BMerge and BPair algorithms to bridge\nthe discrepancies between two binary code snippets caused by different\noptimization levels or platforms. Furthermore, we empirically study the\nproperties of our dataset and evaluate its effectiveness for the BCSA research.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that BinSimDB significantly improves the\nperformance of binary code similarity comparison.</p>\n", "tags": ["Deep", "Unimodal", "Supervised", "Training Strategy", "Applications"], "tsne_embedding": [-11.267736434936523, -23.17278480529785], "cluster": 6}, {"key": "\u00f1anculef2020self", "year": "2020", "citations": "1", "title": "Self-supervised Bernoulli Autoencoders For Semi-supervised Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Semantic hashing is an emerging technique for large-scale similarity search\nbased on representing high-dimensional data using similarity-preserving binary\ncodes used for efficient indexing and search. It has recently been shown that\nvariational autoencoders, with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by\nneural nets, can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and\nunsupervised scenarios, improving on more traditional methods thanks to their\nability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However, the scenario\nwhere labels are scarce has not been studied yet.\n  This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on\nvariational autoencoders to the lack of supervision, focusing on two\nsemi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational\nautoencoder\u2019s training objective to jointly model the distribution over the\ndata and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to\ndefine an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the\nsimilarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space.\nOur experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash\ncodes\u2019 quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number\nof labelled points is large. However, we found that this method degrades\nquickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent\nthis problem, we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its\nlabel distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to\nthe best baseline, this procedure yields similar performance in fully\nsupervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data\nis scarce.
