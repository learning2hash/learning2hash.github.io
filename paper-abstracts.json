Traditionally these methods utilize pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and VGG-16 as feature extractors. However the increasing complexity of datasets poses challenges for these backbone architectures in capturing meaningful features essential for effective image retrieval. In this study we explore the efficacy of employing high-resolution features learned through state-of-the-art techniques for image retrieval tasks. Specifically we propose a novel methodology that utilizes High-Resolution Networks (HRNets) as the backbone for the deep hashing task termed High-Resolution Hashing Network (HHNet). Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across all tested benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE MS COCO and ImageNet. This performance improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets which highlights the need to learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks.

However none of the existing works uses hashing to address texture image retrieval mostly because of the lack of sufficiently large texture image databases. Our work addresses this problem by developing a novel deep learning architecture that generates binary hash codes for input texture images. For this we first pre-train a Texture Synthesis Network (TSN) which takes a texture patch as input and outputs an enlarged view of the texture by injecting newer texture content. Thus it signifies that the TSN encodes the learnt texture specific information in its intermediate layers. In the next stage a second network gathers the multi-scale feature representations from the TSNs intermediate layers using channel-wise attention combines them in a progressive manner to a dense continuous representation which is finally converted into a binary hash code with the help of individual and pairwise label information. The new enlarged texture patches also help in data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient texture data and are used to train the second stage of the network. Experiments on three public texture image retrieval datasets indicate the superiority of our texture synthesis guided hashing approach over current state-of-the-art methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning","Image Retrieval"] },

Though there has been considerable work on how to construct good perfect hash functions there is a gap between theory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On one side there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven practicality for large key sets. On the other side there are the theoretically analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash functions are available for free which is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice using a number of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel theoretically optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods and the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64 for which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the range 0…2n-1 the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e. one bit more than optimal for representing the key).

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient. We conduct experiments on three public benchmarks containing up to one million descriptors and show that the proposed DAQ method consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art quantization methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval","Quantisation","TOM"] },

To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval, unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However, most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result, existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article, we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function, exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence, and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem, and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki, MIRFlickr, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO).

Among many possibilities Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring shortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and utilization of hash codes pushing a system to attain higher mAP will inevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of the hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples in the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not necessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper we introduce a new metric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation of the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a retrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash codes leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than conventional ones like mAP. To this end we start by mathematical analysis of the deficiencies of mAP for hashing-based retrieval. We then propose mLGAP and show why it is more appropriate for hashing-based retrieval.

However since these ANN approaches must go through the neural measures several times during ranking the computation is not practical if the neural measure is a large network. On the other hand fast item ranking using existing hashing-based approaches such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions. Hashing approaches however are attractive because they provide a principle and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper we propose a simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking problem that can be used for any type of measure including neural network measures. Specifically we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g. users and items) into a common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme.

We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions.

The top-ranked images in the returned query results may be as a different class than the query image. This ranking problem is caused by classification regions of interest (ROI) and small-sample information loss in the hashing space. To address the ranking problem we propose an end-to-end framework called Attention-based Triplet Hashing (ATH) network to learn low-dimensional hash codes that preserve the classification ROI and small-sample information.

Unfortunately,\nall known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality;\nin fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search.

Recent work shows that learned binary projections are a powerful way to index large collections according to their content. The basic idea is to formulate the projections so as to approximately preserve a given similarity function of interest. Having done so, one can then search the data efficiently using hash tables, or by exploring the Hamming ball volume around a novel query.

If designed properly hash-tables can enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly referred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes less structured (as is common for big-data applications) the need for efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce HashGraph a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts taken from sparse graph representations–hence the name HashGraph. We show two different variants of HashGraph a simple algorithm that outlines the method to create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use open-addressing or chaining yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph currently works for static inputs though recent progress with dynamic graph data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining approaches have. Further we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the load-factor. Lastly we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of value lookups. Given the above HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs though HashGraph is not architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU HashGraph is anywhere from 2X-8X faster than cuDPP WarpDrive and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the same rate.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph"] },

In this paper we propose a new learning-based hashing method called</code>fast supervised discrete hashing (FSDH) based on ``supervised discrete hashing (SDH). Regressing the training examples (or hash code) to the corresponding class labels is widely used in ordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method FSDH uses a very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples to the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems with the most critical sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC) which is time-consuming. However FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than iterative hash code-solving step which is highly efficient. Furthermore FSDH is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares regression making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example our results show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base and FSDH is about 151-times faster than FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base.

One such alternative is multi-index hashing an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH) an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing while being end-to-end trainable.

In this paper,\nManhattan hashing (MH), which is based on Manhattan distance, is\nproposed to solve the problem of Hamming distance based hashing.\nThe basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with\nmultiple bits of natural binary code (NBC), based on which the\nManhattan distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated\nfor nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the\nneighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt Manhattan\ndistance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several largescale\nimage data sets containing up to one million points show that\nour MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art\nmethods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval","Quantisation","SIGIR"] },

Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions.

This hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If labels for data are given one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning algorithms. However many proposed learning methods do not consider the hyperplanes offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes small.

There is a lower bound of nlog(e)=1.44n bits needed to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm that tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed leading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for constructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building block. In this paper we introduce ShockHash - Small heavily overloaded cuckoo hash tables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and h_1 hoping for the existence of a function f S-0 1 such that x - h_f(x)(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to store f using n + o(n) bits. In graph terminology ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until stumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as nodes. Using cuckoo hashing ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the pseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about (e/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the seed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space consumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to brute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again to 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all possible pairs. ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be constructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.

(b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g. 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However as online algorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context of search it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for them. This paper demonstrates that b-bit minwise hashing provides an effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process. This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g. 10 to 100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix due to its space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions e.g. the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations.

The major drawback of minwise hashing is the expensive preprocessing cost as the method requires applying (e.g.) k=200 to 500 permutations on the data. The testing time can also be expensive if a new data point (e.g. a new document or image) has not been processed which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications. We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing. Conceptually given a massive binary data matrix we permute the columns only once and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store for each data vector the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The interesting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals that our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original (k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact the one permutation scheme can be even slightly more accurate due to the sample-without-replacement effect. Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the webspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can achieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original k-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method we also experiment with the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average 500 nonzeros in each data vector. Interestingly our one permutation scheme noticeably outperforms the k-permutation scheme when k is not too small on the news20 dataset. In summary our method can achieve at least the same accuracy as the original k-permutation scheme at merely 1/k of the original preprocessing cost.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

In particular we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important practical applications. For example in the task of near neighbor search a crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed coding scheme and estimator. As a related task in this paper we also study a simple uniform quantization scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For example when the target similarity level is high 2 or 3 bits might be sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high it is preferable to use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good choice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash tables.

Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically by using one hash code to represent one image existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper we propose a novel hashing framework called multiple code hashing (MCH) to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval.

An initial permutation is applied to break whatever structures which might exist in the data and a second permutation is re-used K times to produce K hashes via a circulant shifting fashion. (Li and Li 2021) has proved that perhaps surprisingly even though the K hashes are correlated the estimation variance is strictly smaller than the variance of the traditional MinHash. It has been demonstrated in (Li and Li 2021) that the initial permutation in C-MinHash is indeed necessary. For the ease of theoretical analysis they have used two independent permutations. In this paper we show that one can actually simply use one permutation. That is one single permutation is used for both the initial pre-processing step to break the structures in the data and the circulant hashing step to generate K hashes. Although the theoretical analysis becomes very complicated we are able to explicitly write down the expression for the expectation of the estimator.

In this paper we propose a ranking-based deep cross-modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a semi-supervised semantic ranking list. Next to expand the semantic representation power of hand-crafted features RDCMH integrates the semantic ranking information into deep cross-modal hashing and jointly optimizes the compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions.

Existing cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence between training samples across modalities are readily available. This assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition these methods generally require the same number of samples across different modalities which restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact of an incomplete correspondence it jointly optimizes in a unified objective function the potential correspondence the cross-modal hashing functions derived from the correspondence and a hashing quantitative loss. An alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the correspondence and hash functions and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of the two objectives.

Nevertheless most existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the discriminative power of semantic information when learning the hash codes while often involving time-consuming training procedure for handling the large-scale dataset. To tackle these issues we formulate the learning of similarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic data so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming space and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH) approach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically FDDH introduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training examples to their corresponding semantic labels and utilizes -dragging technique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly the discriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and maximized. Moreover an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to map the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace which can well guarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic representation. Consequently an efficient closed form solution is derived for discriminative hash code learning which is very computationally efficient.

However it is indeed problematic to directly minimize such error since such mentioned two metric spaces are heterogeneous and the quasi-isometric mapping is non-linear. The former leads to inconsistent feature distributions while the latter leads to problematic optimization issues. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method termed Sparsity-Induced Generative Adversarial Hashing (SiGAH) to encode large-scale high-dimensional features into binary codes which well solves the two problems through a generative adversarial training framework. Instead of minimizing the quantization loss our key innovation lies in enforcing the learned Hamming space to have similar data distribution to the target metric space via a generative model. In particular we formulate a ReLU-based neural network as a generator to output binary codes and an MSE-loss based auto-encoder network as a discriminator upon which a generative adversarial learning is carried out to train hash functions. Furthermore to generate the synthetic features from the hash codes a compressed sensing procedure is introduced into the generative model which enforces the reconstruction boundary of binary codes to be consistent with that of original features.

The majority of recent approaches usually reconstruct semantic similarity information, which then guides the hash code learning. However, they still fail to achieve satisfactory performance in reality for two reasons. On the one hand, without accurate supervised information, these methods usually fail to produce independent and robust hash codes with semantics information well preserved, which may hinder effective image retrieval. On the other hand, due to discrete constraints, how to effectively optimize the hashing network in an end-to-end manner with small quantization errors remains a problem. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method called HARR to learn discriminative and high-quality hash codes. To comprehensively explore semantic similarity structure, HARR adopts the Winner-Take-All hash to model the similarity structure. Then similarity-preserving hash codes are learned under the reliable guidance of the reconstructed similarity structure. Additionally, we improve the quality of hash codes by a bit correlation reduction module, which forces the cross-correlation matrix between a batch of hash codes under different augmentations to approach the identity matrix. In this way, the generated hash bits are expected to be invariant to disturbances with minimal redundancy, which can be further interpreted as an instantiation of the information bottleneck principle. Finally, for effective hashing network training, we minimize the cosine distances between real-value network outputs and their binary codes for small quantization errors.

Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image classification and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks.

Realizing that heterogeneous entities and relationships are also ubiquitous in the real world applications, there is an emerging need to retrieve and search similar or relevant data entities from multiple heterogeneous domains, e.g., recommending relevant posts and images to a certain Facebook user. In this paper, we address the problem of ``comparing apples to oranges’’ under the large scale setting. Specifically, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Hashing (RaHH), which provides a general framework for generating hash codes of data entities sitting in multiple heterogeneous domains. Unlike some existing hashing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space, the RaHH approach constructs a Hamming space for each type of data entities, and learns optimal mappings between them simultaneously. This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover, the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method, we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites, Tencent Weibo, and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RaHH outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods with significant performance gains.</p>\n", "tags": ["Cross Modal"] },

Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency structures these methods rarely model the raw documents directly but instead to model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW) TFIDF). In this paper we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing their tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try we modify existing generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However little improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF features. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative hashing which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT embeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue a new unsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual information (MI) maximization principle. Specifically the method first constructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks to maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes that outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial margin.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Supervised","Unsupervised"] },

The earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions (that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash tables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest neighbor in at least one table. Our approach is different – we use one (or a few) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket containing its nearest neighbor. We show that the number of randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point q required depends on the entropy of the hash value h(p) of a random point p at the same distance from q at its nearest neighbor given q and the locality preserving hash function h chosen randomly from the hash family. Precisely we show that if the entropy I(h(p)qh) = M and g is a bound on the probability that two far-off points will hash to the same bucket then we can find the approximate nearest neighbor in O(n^rho) time and near linear tilde O(n) space where rho = M/log(1/g).

To tackle the key challenge of hashing on the manifold a well-studied Riemannian kernel mapping is employed to project data (i.e. covariance matrices) into Euclidean space and thus enables to embed the two heterogeneous representations into a common Hamming space where both intra-space discriminability and inter-space compatibility are considered. To perform network optimization the gradient of the kernel mapping is innovatively derived via structured matrix backpropagation in a theoretically principled way. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method achieves quite competitive performance compared with existing hashing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Video Retrieval"] },

Still the interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the embeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that decomposes the learning problem in two stages first perform similarity learning over the embedding space with no quantization; second find an optimal orthogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding is close to its sign and then quantize the transformed embedding through the sign function. In the second step we parametrize orthogonal transformations using Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent. Since similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal transformations this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of performance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised fast hyperparameter-free and can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning algorithm.

On one hand various deep neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images. On the other hand the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way. However with the number of database samples increasing it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of large-scale database images. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL) for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes.

However, all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix, ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one, i.e., the categories that samples do not belong to.

The cost of hashing is proportional to data dimensions and thus often the performance bottleneck when dimensionality is high and the number of hash functions involved is large. Surprisingly however little work has been done to improve the efficiency of LSH computation. In this paper we design a simple yet efficient LSH scheme named FastLSH under l2 norm. By combining random sampling and random projection FastLSH reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(m) (m&lt;n) where n is the data dimensionality and m is the number of sampled dimensions. Moreover FastLSH has provable LSH property which distinguishes it from the non-LSH fast sketches. We conduct comprehensive experiments over a collection of real and synthetic datasets for the nearest neighbor search task. Experimental results demonstrate that FastLSH is on par with the state-of-the-arts in terms of answer quality space occupation and query efficiency while enjoying up to 80x speedup in hash function evaluation.

The resulting summaries are useful in many applications including image indexing image authentication and pattern recognition. These hashes need to be invariant under transformations of the image that result in similar visual content but should drastically differ for conceptually distinct contents. This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a saliency graph connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph that is its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image making the hash robust to image transformation yet distinct for different visual content. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on a set of MRI 2-D slices and on a database of faces.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph"] },

These services which include image search engines must handle an overwhelming volume of data while keeping low response times. Thus scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web-scale applications but most existing methods are sequential and target shared-memory machines. Here we address these issues with a distributed efficient and scalable index based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular techniques for similarity search but its poor referential locality properties has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data storage locality-aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing and multi-probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained an efficiency of 90 in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In particular the original locality-aware data partition reduced the number of messages exchanged in 30. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with 10^9 128-d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images.

Here we survey recent results on how simple hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees. Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist 1970. Keys are viewed as consisting of c characters and we have precomputed character tables h_1…h_c mapping characters to random hash values. A key x=(x_1…x_c) is hashed to h_1x_1 oplus h_2x_2…..oplus h_cx_c. This schemes is very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even 4-independent it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally obtained via higher independence e.g. linear probing and Cuckoo hashing. Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is twisted in a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional properties Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and data-structures. Finally we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation functions applying one to the output of the other and show that this yields very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman 1977. In fact w.h.p. for a given set of size proportional to that of the space consumed double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given time and space.

Nearest neighbor retrieval across multiple modalities on large data sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an efficient solution since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise XOR operations can be fast handled the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing code length becomes longer the retrieval performance improvement becomes slower. In this paper we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR) for multimodal hashing.

For the supervised cross-modal hashing methods how to make the learned hash codes preserve semantic information sufficiently contained in the label of datapoints is the key to further enhance the retrieval performance. Hence almost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depends on defining a similarity between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing model learning fully or partly. However the defined similarity between datapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and misses abundant semantic information then hinders the further improvement of retrieval performance. Thus in this paper different from previous works we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity between datapoints called Deep Cross-modal Hashing via (DCHML). Specifically DCHML first trains a proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset into a semantic discriminative hash code called proxy hash code. Each proxy hash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category well. Next without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the training process of the modality-specific hashing networks we propose a novel to directly utilize the proxy hashing codes as supervised information.

To tackle these problems we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper-sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition we extend the K-Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K-Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm including hierarchical instance-wise and hierarchical prototype-wise contrastive learning.

It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically based on the captured visual representations by attention we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then driven by preserving original entities similarity the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path.

Simply applying existing cross-modal approaches to this new task fails to adequately capture latent multi-modal semantics and effectively bridge the modality gap between 2D and 3D. To address these issues without relying on hand-crafted labels we propose contrastive masked autoencoders based self-supervised hashing (CMAH) for retrieval between images and point-cloud data. We start by contrasting 2D-3D pairs and explicitly constraining them into a joint Hamming space. This contrastive learning process ensures robust discriminability for the generated hash codes and effectively reduces the modality gap. Moreover we utilize multi-modal auto-encoders to enhance the models understanding of multi-modal semantics.

Typically the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper we propose a novel method called isotropic hashing (IsoHash) to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances).

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples.

The recent successes seen in Learning-based hashing methods are largely due to the success of deep learning-based hashing methods. However there are some limitations to previous learning-based hashing methods (e.g. the learned hash codes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper we propose a novel learning-based hashing method named Deep Attention-guided Hashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea is to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the first stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of the hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing network). Specifically in the first network it leverages an attention network and hashing network to generate the attention-guided hash codes from the original images. The loss function we propose contains two components the semantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the attention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the second network these attention-guided hash codes are used to guide the training of the second hashing network (i.e. these codes are treated as supervised labels to train the second network). By doing this DAgH can make full use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the second hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true end-to-end fashion. Results from our experiments demonstrate that DAgH can generate high quality hash codes and it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning","Supervised"] },

To overcome these challenges we propose a novel federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for each class.

Notably it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further we for the first time formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms meanwhile the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

Conventional methods often study these two steps separately e.g. learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency i.e. images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits.

To overcome these challenges we propose a unified Semantic-Aware DIscrete Hashing (SADIH) framework which aims to directly embed the transformed semantic information into the asymmetric similarity approximation and discriminative hashing function learning. Specifically a semantic-aware latent embedding is introduced to asymmetrically preserve the full pairwise similarities while skillfully handle the cumbersome n times n pairwise similarity matrix. Meanwhile a semantic-aware autoencoder is developed to jointly preserve the data structures in the discriminative latent semantic space and perform data reconstruction. Moreover an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem.

Many hashing approaches have been proposed for the cross-media search task. However, there are still open problems that warrant investigation. For example, most existing supervised hashing approaches employ a binary label matrix, which achieves small margins between wrong labels (0) and true labels (1). This may affect the retrieval performance by generating many false negatives and false positives. In addition, some methods adopt a relaxation scheme to solve the binary constraints, which may cause large quantization errors. There are also some discrete hashing methods that have been presented, but most of them are time-consuming. To conquer these problems, we present a label relaxation and discrete matrix factorization method (LRMF) for cross-modal retrieval. It offers a number of innovations. First of all, the proposed approach employs a novel label relaxation scheme to control the margins adaptively, which has the benefit of reducing the quantization error.

In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme named as canonical view based discrete multi-modal hashing (CV-DMH) to handle these problems via a novel three-stage learning procedure. First a submodular function is designed to measure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it canonical views which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited redundancy are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy. Second multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from multiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and adaptively characterize visual contents of varied landmark images with certain canonical views. Finally compact binary codes are learned on intermediate representation within a tailored discrete binary embedding model which preserves visual relations of images measured with canonical views and removes the involved noises. In this part we develop a new augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) based optimization method to directly solve the discrete binary codes. We can not only explicitly deal with the discrete constraint but also consider the bit-uncorrelated constraint and balance constraint together. Experiments on real world landmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CV-DMH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","TIP"] },

It is important that real-time search be performed in a large gallery. While previous methods mostly focus on discriminative learning this paper makes the attempt in integrating deep learning and hashing into one framework to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy for large-scale person re-id. We integrate spatial information for discriminative visual representation by partitioning the pedestrian image into horizontal parts. Specifically Part-based Deep Hashing (PDH) is proposed in which batches of triplet samples are employed as the input of the deep hashing architecture. Each triplet sample contains two pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity and one pedestrian image (or part) of the different identity. A triplet loss function is employed with a constraint that the Hamming distance of pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity is smaller than ones with the different identity. In the experiment we show that the proposed Part-based Deep Hashing method yields very competitive re-id accuracy on the large-scale Market-1501 and Market-1501+500K datasets.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning"] },

However the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem in this paper we propose a novel hashing approach dubbed as (DSTH). The key idea is to augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss we explicitly impose the discrete constraint bit–uncorrelation constraint and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Image Retrieval","Supervised","TIP","Unsupervised"] },

Deep hashing is an efficient indexing technique to support large-scale social image retrieval due to its deep representation capability fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Particularly unsupervised deep hashing has well scalability as it does not require any manually labelled data for training. However owing to the lacking of label guidance existing methods suffer from severe semantic shortage when optimizing a large amount of deep neural network parameters. Differently in this paper we propose a Dual-level Semantic Transfer Deep Hashing (DSTDH) method to alleviate this problem with a unified deep hash learning framework. Our model targets at learning the semantically enhanced deep hash codes by specially exploiting the user-generated tags associated with the social images. Specifically we design a complementary dual-level semantic transfer mechanism to efficiently discover the potential semantics of tags and seamlessly transfer them into binary hash codes. On the one hand instance-level semantics are directly preserved into hash codes from the associated tags with adverse noise removing. Besides an image-concept hypergraph is constructed for indirectly transferring the latent high-order semantic correlations of images and tags into hash codes. Moreover the hash codes are obtained simultaneously with the deep representation learning by the discrete hash optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on two public social image retrieval datasets validate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art hashing methods.

{"key": "zhu2022a", "year": "2022", "title":"A Lower Bound of Hash Codes Performance", "abstract": "<p>As a crucial approach for compact representation learning hashing has achieved great success in effectiveness and efficiency. Numerous heuristic Hamming space metric learning objectives are designed to obtain high-quality hash codes. Nevertheless a theoretical analysis of criteria for learning good hash codes remains largely unexploited. In this paper we prove that inter-class distinctiveness and intra-class compactness among hash codes determine the lower bound of hash codes performance. Promoting these two characteristics could lift the bound and improve hash learning. We then propose a surrogate model to fully exploit the above objective by estimating the posterior of hash codes and controlling it which results in a low-bias optimization. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. By testing on a series of hash-models we obtain performance improvements among all of them with an up to 26.5 increase in mean Average Precision and an up to 20.5 increase in accuracy.

However existing methods utilize local similarity and fall short of deeply fusing the multi-view features resulting in poor retrieval accuracy. Current methods only use local similarity to train their model. These methods ignore global similarity. Furthermore most recent works fuse the multi-view features via a weighted sum or concatenation. We contend that these fusion methods are insufficient for capturing the interaction between various views. We present a novel Central Similarity Multi-View Hashing (CSMVH) method to address the mentioned problems. Central similarity learning is used for solving the local similarity problem which can utilize the global similarity between the hash center and samples. We present copious empirical data demonstrating the superiority of gate-based fusion over conventional approaches.

To solve this problem we propose a new baseline CLIP Multi-modal Hashing (CLIPMH) method. It uses CLIP model to extract text and image features and then fuse to generate hash code. CLIP improves the expressiveness of each modal feature. In this way it can greatly improve the retrieval performance of multi-modal hashing methods. In comparison to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised multi-modal hashing methods experiments reveal that the proposed CLIPMH can significantly enhance performance (Maximum increase of 8.38).

Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels which we call unseen images zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper for the first time a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.
