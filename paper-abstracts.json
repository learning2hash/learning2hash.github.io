However, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes, which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed, most of them are time-consuming. In addition, most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization, making them unscalable. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method—Scalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing, SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition, it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm, it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover, the binary codes can be generated discretely, reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely, Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, and NUS-WIDE, have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Cross Modal","Quantisation","Supervised"] },

Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits, but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach: we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other, but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly, we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable, but it also improves over the more complex, coupled objective function, and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval","NEURIPS","Supervised"] },

We show that the expected size of (h(X)) matches that with fully random hashing to within low-order terms. We also provide concentration bounds. The number of non-empty bins is a fundamental measure in the balls and bins paradigm, and it is critical in applications such as Bloom filters and Filter hashing. For example, normally Bloom filters are proportioned for a desired low false-positive probability assuming fully random hashing (see \\url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter}).

The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as consisting of (c=O(1)) characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as (c=8) characters of 8-bits. The character domain (\\Sigma) should be small enough that character tables of size (|\\Sigma|) fit in fast cache. The schemes then use (O(1)) tables of this size, so the space of tabulation hashing is (O(|\\Sigma|)). However, the concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are (\\ll |\\Sigma|). To see the problem, consider the very simple case where we use tabulation hashing to throw (n) balls into (m) bins and want to analyse the number of balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds, we are fine if (n=m), for then the expected value is (1). However, if (m=2), as when tossing (n) unbiased coins, the expected value (n/2) is (\\gg |\\Sigma|) for large data sets, e.g., data sets that do not fit in fast cache. To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space, we need a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation, plus a new tabulation technique that we call \\emph{tabulation-permutation} hashing which is at most twice as slow as simple tabulation. No other hashing scheme of comparable speed offers similar Chernoff-style concentration bounds.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },
{"key": "aamand2020no", "year": "2020", "title":"No Repetition Fast Streaming With Highly Concentrated Hashing", "abstract": "<p>To get estimators that work within a certain error bound with high probability, a common strategy is to design one that works with constant probability, and then boost the probability using independent repetitions. Important examples of this approach are small space algorithms for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream, or estimating the set similarity between large sets. Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each element, we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large error is, say, 1/4. By performing (r) independent repetitions and taking the median of the estimators, the error probability falls exponentially in (r). However, running (r) independent experiments increases the processing time by a factor (r). Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong concentration bounds, then we get the same high probability bounds without any need for repetitions. Instead of (r) independent sketches, we have a single sketch that is (r) times bigger, so the total space is the same. However, we only apply a single hash function, so we save a factor (r) in time, and the overall algorithms just get simpler. Fast practical hash functions with strong concentration bounds were recently proposed by Aamand em et al. (to appear in STOC 2020). Using their hashing schemes, the algorithms thus become very fast and practical, suitable for online processing of high volume data streams.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

Our solution builds upon the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework of Indyk and Motwani, which represents the asymptotically best solutions to near neighbor problems in high dimensions. While traditional LSH data structures have several parameters whose optimal values depend on the distance distribution from (q) to the points of (S), our data structure is parameter-free, except for the space usage, which is configurable by the user. Nevertheless, its expected query time basically matches that of an LSH data structure whose parameters have been <em>optimally chosen for the data and query</em> in question under the given space constraints. In particular, our data structure provides a smooth trade-off between hard queries (typically addressed by standard LSH) and easy queries such as those where the number of points to report is a constant fraction of (S), or where almost all points in (S) are far away from the query point.

Many recent approaches to visual localization have thus proposed a hybrid method, where first a global (per image) embedding is used to retrieve a small subset of database images, and local features of the query are matched only against those. It seems to have become common belief that global embeddings are critical for said image-retrieval in visual localization, despite the significant downside of having to compute two feature types for each query image.

We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efficiently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as finding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or finding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18]and on hashing [21].

App-based solutions have emerged for Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel cross hashing approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been exposed using (k)-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can offer like-for-like efficacy to the existing protocol.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph"] },

Furthermore, the diversity of coding styles and flexibility of modern languages makes it difficult and cost ineffective to manually inspect large code repositories. Therefore, detection is only feasible by automatic techniques. We present an efficient and scalable approach for similar code fragment identification based on source code control flow graphs fingerprinting. The source code is processed to generate control flow graphs that are then hashed to create a unique fingerprint of the code capturing semantics as well as syntax similarity.

Often, people use other people’s pictures on their own profile. Perceptual hashing is often used to detect whether two images are identical. Therefore, it can be used to detect whether people are misusing others’ pictures. In perceptual hashing, a hash is calculated for a given image, and a new test image is mapped to one of the existing hashes if duplicate features are present. Therefore, it can be used as an image filter to flag banned image content or adversarial attacks –which are modifications that are made on purpose to deceive the filter– even though the content might be changed to deceive the filters. For this reason, it is critical for perceptual hashing to be robust enough to take transformations such as resizing, cropping, and slight pixel modifications into account. In this paper, we would like to propose to experiment with effect of gaussian blurring in perceptual hashing for detecting misuse of personal images specifically for face images. We hypothesize that use of gaussian blurring on the image before calculating its hash will increase the accuracy of our filter that detects adversarial attacks which consist of image cropping, adding text annotation, and image rotation.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

The key operation in all these algorithms was length reduction. The sparse data is mapped into small vectors that preserve the convolution result. The reduction method used to-date was the modulo function since it preserves location (of the 1 bits) up to cyclic shift. To date there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the sparse Walsh transform. Since the modulo function does not preserve the Walsh transform a new method for length reduction is needed.

We propose a novel approach that allows 16-bit quantizers to offer the same response time as 8-bit quantizers, while still providing a boost of accuracy. Our approach builds on two key ideas: (i) the construction of derived codebooks that allow a fast and approximate distance evaluation, and (ii) a two-pass NN search procedure which builds a candidate set using the derived codebooks, and then refines it using 16-bit quantizers. On 1 billion SIFT vectors, with an inverted index, our approach offers a Recall@100 of 0.85 in 5.2 ms. By contrast, 16-bit quantizers alone offer a Recall@100 of 0.85 in 39 ms, and 8-bit quantizers a Recall@100 of 0.82 in 3.8 ms.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Quantisation"] },

However, for a number of problems the LSH framework is not known to yield good solutions, and instead ad hoc solutions have been designed for particular similarity and distance measures. For example, this is true for output-sensitive similarity search/join, and for indexes supporting annulus queries that aim to report a point close to a certain given distance from the query point. In this paper we initiate the study of distance-sensitive hashing (DSH), a generalization of LSH that seeks a family of hash functions such that the probability of two points having the same hash value is a given function of the distance between them. More precisely, given a distance space $(X, \\text{dist})( and a collision probability function (CPF) )f\\colon \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow [0,1]$ we seek a distribution over pairs of functions ((h,g)) such that for every pair of points (x, y \\in X) the collision probability is (\\Pr[h(x)=g(y)] = f(\\text{dist}(x,y))). Locality-sensitive hashing is the study of how fast a CPF can decrease as the distance grows. For many spaces, (f) can be made exponentially decreasing even if we restrict attention to the symmetric case where (g=h). We show that the asymmetry achieved by having a pair of functions makes it possible to achieve CPFs that are, for example, increasing or unimodal, and show how this leads to principled solutions to problems not addressed by the LSH framework.

They can employ signature based techniques and/or flow-based techniques to prevent intrusion from outside/ inside the network they are trying to protect. Signature based IDS/ IPS can be stateless or stateful. Stateful IDS can store the state of the protocol and use it for better detection of malware. In the case of TCP/IP networks, an attacker can also launch an attack such that the malicious code is distributed over many packets. These packets pass through the traditional IDS/ IPS and reassemble inside the network. Once re-assembled inside the network by the TCP/IP layer, the malicious code launches an attack. The TCP state and a copy of last few packets for each active connection has to be maintained in IDS/IPS. In TCP re-assembly, packets are re-assembled at IDS/IPS and searched for signature matches. A connection table has to be maintained for active connections and their list of last few (atmost 11) packets that have already arrived. We need data structures for searching the connection that the latest incoming packet belongs to. Popular hashing algorithms like CRC, XOR, summing tuple, taking modulus are inefficient as hash keys are not evenly distributed in hash-key space. Thus we show how an algorithm based on cryptography concepts can be used for efficient hashing in network connection management. We also show how to use full four tuple for calculating hash key instead of simply summing the tuple and taking the modulus of the sum.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph"] },

A central reason for this is that many of the fundamental properties that one desires from a hash table are difficult to achieve simultaneously; thus many variants offering different trade-offs have been proposed. This paper introduces Iceberg hashing, a hash table that simultaneously offers the strongest known guarantees on a large number of core properties. Iceberg hashing supports constant-time operations while improving on the state of the art for space efficiency, cache efficiency, and low failure probability. Iceberg hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to (1 - o(1)) while being stable, meaning that the position where an element is stored only ever changes when resizes occur. In fact, in the setting where keys are (\\Theta(\\log n)) bits, the space guarantees that Iceberg hashing offers, namely that it uses at most (\\log \\binom{|U|}{n} + O(n \\log \\log n)) bits to store (n) items from a universe (U), matches a lower bound by Demaine et al. that applies to any stable hash table. Iceberg hashing introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the most basic aspects of hash-table design.

It is widely believed and taught, however, that linear probing should never be used at high load factors; this is because primary-clustering effects cause insertions at load factor (1 - 1 /x) to take expected time (\\Theta(x^2)) (rather than the ideal (\\Theta(x))). The dangers of primary clustering, first discovered by Knuth in 1963, have been taught to generations of computer scientists, and have influenced the design of some of many widely used hash tables. We show that primary clustering is not a foregone conclusion. We demonstrate that small design decisions in how deletions are implemented have dramatic effects on the asymptotic performance of insertions, so that, even if a hash table operates continuously at a load factor (1 - \\Theta(1/x)), the expected amortized cost per operation is (\\tilde{O}(x)). This is because tombstones created by deletions actually cause an anti-clustering effect that combats primary clustering. We also present a new variant of linear probing (which we call graveyard hashing) that completely eliminates primary clustering on \\emph{any} sequence of operations: if, when an operation is performed, the current load factor is (1 - 1/x) for some (x), then the expected cost of the operation is (O(x)). One corollary is that, in the external-memory model with a data blocks of size (B), graveyard hashing offers the following remarkable guarantee: at any load factor (1 - 1/x) satisfying (x = o(B)), graveyard hashing achieves (1 + o(1)) expected block transfers per operation.

In combination, the resulting improvements yield speedups up to 239 on an 8-core CPU and up to 5438 using a GPU. The original single-threaded RecSplit implementation needs 1.5 hours to construct an MPHF for 5 Million objects with 1.56 bits per object. On the GPU, we achieve the same space usage in just 5 seconds. Given that the speedups are larger than the increase in energy consumption, our implementation is more energy efficient than the original implementation.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

However, none of the existing works uses hashing to address texture image retrieval mostly because of the lack of sufficiently large texture image databases. Our work addresses this problem by developing a novel deep learning architecture that generates binary hash codes for input texture images. For this, we first pre-train a Texture Synthesis Network (TSN) which takes a texture patch as input and outputs an enlarged view of the texture by injecting newer texture content. Thus it signifies that the TSN encodes the learnt texture specific information in its intermediate layers. In the next stage, a second network gathers the multi-scale feature representations from the TSN’s intermediate layers using channel-wise attention, combines them in a progressive manner to a dense continuous representation which is finally converted into a binary hash code with the help of individual and pairwise label information. The new enlarged texture patches also help in data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient texture data and are used to train the second stage of the network. Experiments on three public texture image retrieval datasets indicate the superiority of our texture synthesis guided hashing approach over current state-of-the-art methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning","Image Retrieval","Independent"] },

While searching proximate vertices had been more expensive than filtering in screen space, we greatly improve over this performance penalty by storing, updating, and looking up the required information in a hash table.

We show that bag of words, a common method to handle such cases, can be viewed as a special match kernel, which counts 1 if two local features fall into the same regions partitioned by visual words and 0 otherwise. Despite its simplicity, this quantization is too coarse. It is, therefore, appealing to design match kernels that more accurately measure the similarity between local features. However, it is impractical to use such kernels on large datasets due to their significant computational cost. To address this problem, we propose an efficient match kernel (EMK), which maps local features to a low dimensional feature space, average the resulting feature vectors to form a set-level feature, then apply a linear classifier. The local feature maps are learned so that their inner products preserve, to the best possible, the values of the specified kernel function. EMK is linear both in the number of images and in the number of local features.

On one side, there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven practicality for large key sets. On the other side, there are the theoretically analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash functions are available for free, which is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice, using a number of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous practical’’ methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel, theoretically optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods, and the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64, for which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the range (\\{0,…,2n-1\\}) the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e., one bit more than optimal for representing the key).

Such an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the hash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is high, then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the system, especially for large indexes.

However, the loss in quality is higher in the BayesLSH variant, where explicit data representation is not available, rather only a hash sketch is available and similarity has to be estimated approximately. In this work we revisit the LSH problem from a Frequentist setting and formulate sequential tests for composite hypothesis (similarity greater than or less than threshold) that can be leveraged by such LSH algorithms for adaptively pruning candidates aggressively. We propose a vanilla sequential probability ration test (SPRT) approach based on this idea and two novel variants. We extend these variants to the case where approximate similarity needs to be computed using fixed-width sequential confidence interval generation technique.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent","LSH"] },

However, there are certain scenarios, as in sequential data, where the proximity of a pair of points cannot be captured without considering their surroundings or context. In videos, as for example, a particular frame is meaningful only when it is seen in the context of its preceding and following frames. LSH has no mechanism to handle the con- texts of the data points. In this article, a novel scheme of Context based Locality Sensitive Hashing (conLSH) has been introduced, in which points are hashed together not only based on their closeness, but also because of similar context. The contribution made in this article is three fold. First, conLSH is integrated with a recently proposed fast optimal sequence alignment algorithm (FOGSAA) using a layered approach. The resultant method is applied to video retrieval for extracting similar sequences. The pro- posed algorithm yields more than 80% accuracy on an average in different datasets. It has been found to save 36.3% of the total time, consumed by the exhaustive search. conLSH reduces the search space to approximately 42% of the entire dataset, when compared with an exhaustive search by the aforementioned FOGSAA, Bag of Words method and the standard LSH implementations. Secondly, the effectiveness of conLSH is demon- strated in action recognition of the video clips, which yields an average gain of 12.83% in terms of classification accuracy over the state of the art methods using STIP descriptors. The last but of great significance is that this article provides a way of automatically annotating long and composite real life videos.

At a high level, an LSH family hashes nearby points to the same bucket and far away points to different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent, which helps determine both query time and space usage. In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 06) constructed an LSH family based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of 1/c^2 for the l_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor and Panigrahy (SIDMA 07) and O’Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT 14). Although optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally expensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical analysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the exponent of lattice based LSH. In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry of numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which additional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low space and query complexity, remains an important open problem.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","FOCS","Independent","LSH"] },

We show that the resulting sampled dataset has strong geometric structure, making approximate near neighbor search return the required samples much more efficiently than for worst case datasets of the same size.

Our quantization method improves both search efficiency and accuracy, while maintaining comparable memory consumption. This is achieved by reducing search space and increasing the number of indexed regions. We introduce a new ANN search system, VLQ-ADC, that is based on the proposed inverted index, and perform extensive evaluation on two public billion-scale benchmark datasets SIFT1B and DEEP1B. Our evaluation shows that VLQ-ADC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU- and CPU-based systems in terms of both accuracy and search speed.

While providing efficient retrieval, the embedding-based retrieval pattern also limits the model capacity since the form of user-item preference measure is restricted to the distance between their embedding representations.

The pseudo-random projection is described by a matrix, where not all entries are independent random variables but instead a fixed budget of randomness is distributed across the matrix. Such matrices can be efficiently stored in sub-quadratic or even linear space, provide reduction in randomness usage (i.e. number of required random values), and very often lead to computational speed ups. We prove several theoretical results showing that projections via various structured matrices followed by nonlinear mappings accurately preserve the angular distance between input high-dimensional vectors. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first that give theoretical ground for the use of general structured matrices in the nonlinear setting. In particular, they generalize previous extensions of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and prove the plausibility of the approach that was so far only heuristically confirmed for some special structured matrices. Consequently, we show that many structured matrices can be used as an efficient information compression mechanism. Our findings build a better understanding of certain deep architectures, which contain randomly weighted and untrained layers, and yet achieve high performance on different learning tasks. We empirically verify our theoretical findings and show the dependence of learning via structured hashed projections on the performance of neural network as well as nearest neighbor classifier.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

There are two existing paradigms for image retrieval: 1) content-based image retrieval (CBIR), which has traditionally used visual features for similarity search (e.g., SIFT features), and 2) tag-based image retrieval (TBIR), which has relied on user tagging (e.g., Flickr tags). CBIR now gains semantic expressiveness by advances in deep-learning-based detection of visual labels. TBIR benefits from query-and-click logs to automatically infer more informative labels. However, learning-based tagging still yields noisy labels and is restricted to concrete objects, missing out on generalizations and abstractions. Click-based tagging is limited to terms that appear in the textual context of an image or in queries that lead to a click. This paper addresses the above limitations by semantically refining and expanding the labels suggested by learning-based object detection. We consider the semantic coherence between the labels for different objects, leverage lexical and commonsense knowledge, and cast the label assignment into a constrained optimization problem solved by an integer linear program. Experiments show that our method, called VISIR, improves the quality of the state-of-the-art visual labeling tools like LSDA and YOLO.</p>\n", "tags": ["Deep Learning","Image Retrieval"] },

Given a family of filters, defined as a distribution over pairs of subsets of space with certain locality-sensitivity properties, we can solve the approximate near neighbor problem in (d)-dimensional space for an (n)-point data set with query time (dn^{\\rho_q+o(1)}), update time (dn^{\\rho_u+o(1)}), and space usage $dn + n^{1 + \\rho_u + o(1)}$. The space-time tradeoff is tied to the tradeoff between query time and update time, controlled by the exponents (\\rho_q, \\rho_u) that are determined by the filter family. Locality-sensitive filtering was introduced by Becker et al. (SODA 2016) together with a framework yielding a single, balanced, tradeoff between query time and space, further relying on the assumption of an efficient oracle for the filter evaluation algorithm. We extend the LSF framework to support space-time tradeoffs and through a combination of existing techniques we remove the oracle assumption.

Therefore, we conduct experiments considering three different scenarios: stable (no removed nodes), one-shot removals (90% of the nodes removed at once), and incremental removals.

In fact, we show that any space which is isometrically embeddable in Hilbert space has the stronger property. This property gives stronger geometric guarantees, and one in particular, which we name the Hilbert Exclusion property, allows any indexing mechanism which uses hyperplane partitioning to perform better. One outcome of this observation is that a number of state-of-the-art indexing mechanisms over high dimensional spaces can be easily extended to give a significant increase in performance; furthermore, the improvement given is greater in higher dimensions.

The concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured input. In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing, namely similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et al.

Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar when the input vectors are sparse. Our main contribution, however, is an experimental comparison of different hashing schemes when used inside FH, OPH, and LSH. We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the classic multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work well on sufficiently random data, but we demonstrate that in the above applications, it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and synthetic data. We also compare with the very popular MurmurHash3, which has no proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to truly random hashing in our experiments.

In particular,cross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in multimedia similarity search applications. However, almost all existing methods employing cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their ignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains richer semantic information, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for cross-modal retrieval. First, we utilize the triplet labels, which describes the relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to capture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We then establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal view to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally, graph regularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the original semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space.

Most existing supervised deep hashing methods exploit supervisory signals to generate similar and dissimilar image pairs for training. However, natural images can have large intraclass and small interclass variations, which may degrade the accuracy of hash codes. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stream ConvNet architecture, which learns hash codes with class-specific representation centers. Our basic idea is that if we can learn a unified binary representation for each class as a center and encourage hash codes of images to be close to the corresponding centers, the intraclass variation will be greatly reduced. Accordingly, we design a neural network that leverages label information and outputs a unified binary representation for each class. Moreover, we also design an image network to learn hash codes from images and force these hash codes to be close to the corresponding class-specific centers.

Due to the petabyte scale of genome archives, most gene search systems now use hashing-based data structures such as Bloom Filters (BF). The state-of-the-art systems such as Compact bit-slicing signature index (COBS) and Repeated And Merged Bloom filters (RAMBO) use BF with Random Hash (RH) functions for gene representation and identification. The standard recipe is to cast the gene search problem as a sequence of membership problems testing if each subsequent gene substring (called kmer) of Q is present in the set of kmers of the entire gene database D. We observe that RH functions, which are crucial to the memory and the computational advantage of BF, are also detrimental to the system performance of gene-search systems. While subsequent kmers being queried are likely very similar, RH, oblivious to any similarity, uniformly distributes the kmers to different parts of potentially large BF, thus triggering excessive cache misses and causing system slowdown. We propose a novel hash function called the Identity with Locality (IDL) hash family, which co-locates the keys close in input space without causing collisions. This approach ensures both cache locality and key preservation. IDL functions can be a drop-in replacement for RH functions and help improve the performance of information retrieval systems. We give a simple but practical construction of IDL function families and show that replacing the RH with IDL functions reduces cache misses by a factor of 5x, thus improving query and indexing times of SOTA methods such as COBS and RAMBO by factors up to 2x without compromising their quality.

Among many possibilities, Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring shortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and utilization of hash codes: pushing a system to attain higher mAP will inevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of the hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples in the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not necessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper, we introduce a new metric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation of the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a retrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash codes, leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than conventional ones like mAP.

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for the task, in which the network is trained to produce binary codes directly from image pixels without the need of manual annotation. In particular, to deal with the non-smoothness of binary constraints, we propose a novel pairwise constrained loss function, which simultaneously encodes the distances between pairs of hash codes, and the binary quantization error. In order to train the network with the proposed loss function, we propose an efficient parameter learning algorithm. In addition, to provide similar / dissimilar training images to train the network, we exploit 3D models reconstructed from unlabelled images for automatic generation of enormous training image pairs.

Hence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper, we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically, our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available, the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors.

Adversarial autoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust, locality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash codes. However, the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be employed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically, they require an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash codes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper, we show that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal retrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this challenge, we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically, by exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional, discrete space, our method efficiently estimates a better variant of Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional Wasserstein distances.

In previous works, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have demonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic searching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network measures). However, since these ANN approaches must go through the neural measures several times during ranking, the computation is not practical if the neural measure is a large network. On the other hand, fast item ranking using existing hashing-based approaches, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions. Hashing approaches, however, are attractive because they provide a principle and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking problem that can be used for any type of measure, including neural network measures. Specifically, we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g., users and items) into a common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme. Then, we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and contrastive samples to train the hashing model.

Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance, producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stage’s continuous relaxation and the inference stage’s discrete quantization is important. However, in the existing deep supervised hashing methods, coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete, uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities.

In a white box setting, these collisions can be replicated across nearly every image pair and hash type (including both deep and non-learned hashes). Furthermore, by attacking points other than the output of a hashing function, an attacker can avoid having to know the details of a particular algorithm, resulting in collisions that transfer across different hash sizes or model architectures.

A natural rapid approach would be finding a hash value for (S) and compare it with a prepared database of hash values for each of length (|S|) subsequences of (R). The problem with such approach is that it would only spot a perfect match, while in reality there are lots of small changes: substitutions, deletions and insertions. This issue could be repaired if having a hash function designed to tolerate some small distortion accordingly to an alignment metric (like Needleman-Wunch): designed to make that two similar sequences should most likely give the same hash value. This paper discusses construction of Distortion-Resistant Hashing (DRH) to generate such fingerprints for rapid search of similar subsequences. The proposed approach is based on the rate distortion theory: in a nearly uniform subset of length (|S|) sequences, the hash value represents the closest sequence to (S). This gives some control of the distance of collisions: sequences having the same hash value.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

The straightforward answer to this problem is to compare the query with all items in the dataset, but this is practical only for small datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the nearest neighbors. However, if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance, then the main issue is that the order of buckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue, we first elaborate on the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table. However, solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only practical for short binary codes. To address this issue, we propose the angular multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash tables on binary code substrings.

A common approach is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user’s multiple interests.

To address both issues, in this paper we propose a flexible bitwise weight learning framework based on the binary codes obtained by state-of-the-art hashing methods, and incorporate the learned weights into the weighted Hamming distance computation. We then formulate the proposed framework as a ranking problem and leverage the Ranking SVM model to offline tackle the weight learning. The framework is further extended to an online mode which updates the weights at each time new data comes, thereby making it scalable to large and dynamic data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains of using binary codes with bitwise weighting in image retrieval tasks. It is appealing that the online weight learning leads to comparable accuracy with its offline counterpart, which thus makes our approach practical for realistic applications.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Image Retrieval","Supervised"] },

State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a set and use specific distance measure to compare two sets. These methods are slow to compute and not compact to use in a large scale scenario. Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be used to efficiently compare two samples. However, most hashing methods encode each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same set represent the same object or person. We investigate the set hashing problem by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image features, then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming set similarity relations using class labels.

However, such approximation leads to uncertainty between real-values and binary ones, degrading retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH). It explicitly estimates the uncertainty during training and leverages the uncertainty information to guide the approximation process. Specifically, we model bit-level uncertainty via measuring the discrepancy between the output of a hashing network and that of a momentum-updated network.

To tackle the challenge, we propose a binary embedding-based retrieval (BEBR) engine equipped with a recurrent binarization algorithm that enables customized bits per dimension.

Several long-tail hashing methods have been proposed but they can not adapt for multi-modal data, due to the complex interplay between labels and individuality and commonality information of multi-modal data. Furthermore, CMH methods mostly mine the commonality of multi-modal data to learn hash codes, which may override tail labels encoded by the individuality of respective modalities. In this paper, we propose LtCMH (Long-tail CMH) to handle imbalanced multi-modal data. LtCMH firstly adopts auto-encoders to mine the individuality and commonality of different modalities by minimizing the dependency between the individuality of respective modalities and by enhancing the commonality of these modalities. Then it dynamically combines the individuality and commonality with direct features extracted from respective modalities to create meta features that enrich the representation of tail labels, and binaries meta features to generate hash codes. LtCMH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-tail datasets and holds a better (or comparable) performance on datasets with balanced labels.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Cross Modal","Independent"] },

It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have, leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets.

Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart.

In this article, we argue that reasons for the underwhelming results of deep methods on image retrieval are threefold: i) noisy training data, ii) inappropriate deep architecture, and iii) suboptimal training procedure. We address all three issues. First, we leverage a large-scale but noisy landmark dataset and develop an automatic cleaning method that produces a suitable training set for deep retrieval. Second, we build on the recent R-MAC descriptor, show that it can be interpreted as a deep and differentiable architecture, and present improvements to enhance it. Last, we train this network with a siamese architecture that combines three streams with a triplet loss. At the end of the training process, the proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single forward pass that is well suited for image retrieval.

If designed properly, hash-tables can enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly referred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes less structured (as is common for big-data applications), the need for efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce HashGraph, a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts taken from sparse graph representations–hence the name HashGraph. We show two different variants of HashGraph, a simple algorithm that outlines the method to create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use open-addressing or chaining, yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph currently works for static inputs, though recent progress with dynamic graph data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining approaches have. Further, we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the load-factor. Lastly, we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of value lookups. Given the above, HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs, though HashGraph is not architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU, HashGraph is anywhere from 2X-8X faster than cuDPP, WarpDrive, and cuDF.

In this paper, we propose a new learning-based hashing method called fast supervised discrete hashing (FSDH) based on supervised discrete hashing (SDH). Regressing the training examples (or hash code) to the corresponding class labels is widely used in ordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method, FSDH uses a very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples to the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems, with the most critical sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC), which is time-consuming. However, FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than iterative hash code-solving step, which is highly efficient. Furthermore, FSDH is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares regression, making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example, our results show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base, and FSDH is about 151-times faster than FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base.

Object similarity can then be computed by learning binary representations (hash codes) of the objects and computing their Hamming distance. While this is highly efficient, each bit dimension is equally weighted, which means that potentially discriminative information of the data is lost. A more expressive alternative is to use real-valued vector representations and compute their inner product; this allows varying the weight of each dimension but is many magnitudes slower. To fix this, we derive a new way of measuring the dissimilarity between two objects in the Hamming space with binary weighting of each dimension (i.e., disabling bits): we consider a field-agnostic dissimilarity that projects the vector of one object onto the vector of the other. When working in the Hamming space, this results in a novel projected Hamming dissimilarity, which by choice of projection, effectively allows a binary importance weighting of the hash code of one object through the hash code of the other. We propose a variational hashing model for learning hash codes optimized for this projected Hamming dissimilarity, and experimentally evaluate it in collaborative filtering experiments. The resultant hash codes lead to effectiveness gains of up to +7% in NDCG and +14% in MRR compared to state-of-the-art hashing-based collaborative filtering baselines, while requiring no additional storage and no computational overhead compared to using the Hamming distance.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way that does not reduce their search efficiency.

One such alternative is multi-index hashing, an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over, which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work, we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH), an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives, which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing, while being end-to-end trainable.

Recent advancements in the field demonstrate that employing large-scale backbones (e.g., ViT) in unsupervised semantic hashing models can yield substantial improvements. However, the inference delay has become increasingly difficult to overlook. Knowledge distillation provides a means for practical model compression to alleviate this delay. Nevertheless, the prevailing knowledge distillation approaches are not explicitly designed for semantic hashing. They ignore the unique search paradigm of semantic hashing, the inherent necessities of the distillation process, and the property of hash codes. In this paper, we propose an innovative Bit-mask Robust Contrastive knowledge Distillation (BRCD) method, specifically devised for the distillation of semantic hashing models. To ensure the effectiveness of two kinds of search paradigms in the context of semantic hashing, BRCD first aligns the semantic spaces between the teacher and student models through a contrastive knowledge distillation objective. Additionally, to eliminate noisy augmentations and ensure robust optimization, a cluster-based method within the knowledge distillation process is introduced.

Such functions find widespread application e.g. in bioinformatics and databases. In this paper we revisit PTHash - a construction technique particularly designed for fast queries. PTHash distributes the input keys into small buckets and, for each bucket, it searches for a hash function seed that places its keys in the output domain without collisions. The collection of all seeds is then stored in a compressed way. Since the first buckets are easier to place, buckets are considered in non-increasing order of size. Additionally, PTHash heuristically produces an imbalanced distribution of bucket sizes by distributing 60% of the keys into 30% of the buckets. Our main contribution is to characterize, up to lower order terms, an optimal distribution of expected bucket sizes. We arrive at a simple, closed form solution which improves construction throughput for space efficient configurations in practice. Our second contribution is a novel encoding scheme for the seeds. We split the keys into partitions. Within each partition, we run the bucket distribution and search step. We then store the seeds in an interleaved way by consecutively placing the seeds for the i-th buckets from all partitions. The seeds for the i-th bucket of each partition follow the same statistical distribution. This allows us to tune a compressor for each bucket. Hence, we call our technique PHOBIC - Perfect Hashing with Optimized Bucket sizes and Interleaved Coding.

Because hashing codes learning is NP-hard, many methods resort to some form of relaxation technique. But the performance of these methods can easily deteriorate due to the relaxation. Luckily, many supervised hashing formulations can be viewed as energy functions, hence solving hashing codes is equivalent to learning marginals in the corresponding conditional random field (CRF). By minimizing the KL divergence between a fully factorized distribution and the Gibbs distribution of this CRF, a set of consistency equations can be obtained, but updating them in parallel may not yield a local optimum since the variational lower bound is not guaranteed to increase.

In contrast to convolution, the involution kernel is dynamically created at each pixel based on the pixel value and parameters that have been learned. This study demonstrates that utilizing a single layer of involution feature extractor alongside a compact convolution model significantly enhances the performance of similarity search. Additionally, we improve predictions by using the GELU activation function rather than the ReLU. The negligible amount of weight parameters in involution with a compact model with better performance makes the model very useful in real-world implementations.

In other words, linear matrices having fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithms (e.g., based on partial Fourier ensembles or on the adjacency matrix of unbalanced expanders) can be readily used in the definition of fast quantized embeddings with small distortions.

Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency.

The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of storage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to learn embedding generation. Empirical results show that DHE achieves comparable AUC against the standard one-hot full embedding, with smaller model sizes. Our work sheds light on the design of DNN-based alternative embedding schemes for categorical features without using embedding table lookup.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

Because the hashing-code learning problem is essentially a discrete optimization problem which is hard to solve, most existing supervised hashing methods try to solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by dropping the discrete constraints. However, these methods typically suffer from poor performance due to the errors caused by the relaxation. Some other methods try to directly solve the discrete optimization problem. However, they are typically time-consuming and unscalable. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called column sampling based discrete supervised hashing (COSDISH), to directly learn the discrete hashing code from semantic information. COSDISH is an iterative method, in each iteration of which several columns are sampled from the semantic similarity matrix and then the hashing code is decomposed into two parts which can be alternately optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Image Retrieval","Supervised"] },

While linear scan over binary hash codes is more efficient than over the high-dimensional representations, its linear-time complexity is still unacceptable for very large databases. Hamming space retrieval enables constant-time search through hash lookups, where for each query, there is a Hamming ball centered at the query and the data points within the ball are returned as relevant. Since inside the Hamming ball implies retrievable while outside irretrievable, it is crucial to explicitly characterize the Hamming ball. The main idea of this work is to directly embody the Hamming radius into the loss functions, leading to Maximum-Margin Hamming Hashing (MMHH), a new model specifically optimized for Hamming space retrieval. We introduce a max-margin t-distribution loss, where the t-distribution concentrates more similar data points to be within the Hamming ball, and the margin characterizes the Hamming radius such that less penalization is applied to similar data points within the Hamming ball. The loss function also introduces robustness to data noise, where the similarity supervision may be inaccurate in practical problems. The model is trained end-to-end using a new semi-batch optimization algorithm tailored to extremely imbalanced data.

The most fundamental metric used to measure how random a hash function or a random number generator is, is its independence: a sequence of random variables is said to be (k)-independent if every variable is uniform and every size (k) subset is independent. In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited independence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort, min-wise hashing and largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be summarized as follows. -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a (5)-independent hash function, Karloff and Raghavan, J.ACM’93 showed $O ( n \\log n)$ expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort. We improve upon this, showing that the same running time is achieved with only (4)-independence. -Min-wise hashing. For a set (A), consider the probability of a particular element being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that (5)-independence implies the optimal probability (O (1 /n)). Broder et al., STOC’98 showed that (2)-independence implies it is (O(1 / \\sqrt{|A|})). We show a matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for (3)- and (4)-independent hash functions. -Largest bucket. We consider the case where (n) balls are distributed to (n) buckets using a (k)-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket size. Alon et. al, STOC’97 showed that there exists a (2)-independent hash function implying a bucket of size (\\Omega ( n^{1/2})).

In the first stage, several projected dimensions of real values are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding. Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to quantize each projected dimension.

There is a hashing scheme that maps feature vectors to bit arrays depending on the signs of the inner products between feature vectors and the normal vectors of hyperplanes placed in the feature space. This hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If labels for data are given, one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning algorithms. However, many proposed learning methods do not consider the hyperplanes’ offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions, and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes small. In this paper, we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms without the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this method, the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of spaces as if it takes into account the offsets.

We demonstrate that the learnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by discovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively measure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image retrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For ImageNet-100 retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit HashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real representations. Finally, our learnt binary codes can perform OOD detection, out-of-the-box, as accurately as a baseline that needs ~3000 samples to tune its threshold, while we require none.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Image Retrieval","Supervised"] },

Past work on this question has been bottlenecked by limitations of the known families of hash functions: The only hash tables to achieve failure probabilities less than (1 / 2^{\\polylog n}) require access to fully-random hash functions – if the same hash tables are implemented using the known explicit families of hash functions, their failure probabilities become (1 / \\poly(n)). To get around these obstacles, we show how to construct a randomized data structure that has the same guarantees as a hash table, but that \\emph{avoids the direct use of hash functions}. Building on this, we are able to construct a hash table using (O(n)) random bits that achieves failure probability $1 / n^{n^{1 - \\epsilon}}( for an arbitrary positive constant )\\epsilon$. In fact, we show that this guarantee can even be achieved by a \\emph{succinct dictionary}, that is, by a dictionary that uses space within a (1 + o(1)) factor of the information-theoretic optimum. Finally we also construct a succinct hash table whose probabilistic guarantees fall on a different extreme, offering a failure probability of $1 / \\poly(n)( while using only )\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$ random bits.

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient. We conduct experiments on three public benchmarks containing up to one million descriptors and show that the proposed DAQ method consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art quantization methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Image Retrieval","Independent","Quantisation"] },

It is widely believed that hash tables waste a considerable amount of memory, as they either leave allocated space untouched (open addressing) or store additional pointers (separate chaining). For the former, Cleary introduced the compact hashing technique that stores only a part of a key to save space. However, as can be seen by the line of research focusing on compact hash tables with open addressing, there is additional information, called displacement, required for restoring a key. There are several representations of this displacement information with different space and time trade-offs. In this article, we introduce a separate chaining hash table that applies the compact hashing technique without the need for the displacement information. Practical evaluations reveal that insertions in this hash table are faster or use less space than all previously known compact hash tables on modern computer architectures when storing sufficiently large satellite data.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

For the two-dimensional case, we derive closed-form expressions for arbitrary spherical codes, and we show that the equilateral triangle is optimal, achieving a better performance than the two-dimensional analogues of hyperplane and cross-polytope hashing. In three and four dimensions, we numerically find that the tetrahedron, (5)-cell, and (16)-cell achieve the best query exponents, while in five or more dimensions orthoplices appear to outperform regular simplices, as well as the root lattice families (A_k) and (D_k).

Measuring similarity (e.g., Jaccard Index) between sets has been a key building block of a wide range of applications, including, plagiarism detection, recommendation, and graph compression. However, as sets have grown in numbers and sizes, the computational cost and storage required for set similarity computation have become substantial, and this has led to the development of hashing and sketching based solutions. In this work, we propose Set2Box, a learning-based approach for compressed representations of sets from which various similarity measures can be estimated accurately in constant time. The key idea is to represent sets as boxes to precisely capture overlaps of sets. Additionally, based on the proposed box quantization scheme, we design Set2Box+, which yields more concise but more accurate box representations of sets. Through extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets, we show that, compared to baseline approaches, Set2Box+ is (a) Accurate: achieving up to 40.8X smaller estimation error while requiring 60% fewer bits to encode sets, (b) Concise: yielding up to 96.8X more concise representations with similar estimation error, and (c) Versatile: enabling the estimation of four set-similarity measures from a single representation of each set.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph","Quantisation"] },

There is a lower bound of n*log(e)=1.44n bits needed to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm that tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed leading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for constructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building block. In this paper, we introduce ShockHash - Small, heavily overloaded cuckoo hash tables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and h_1, hoping for the existence of a function f : S-&gt;{0, 1} such that x -&gt; h_{f(x)}(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to store f using n + o(n) bits. In graph terminology, ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until stumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as nodes. Using cuckoo hashing, ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the pseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about (e/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the seed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space consumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to brute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again to 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all possible pairs. ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be constructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches. It can build an MPHF for 10 million keys with 1.489 bits per key in about half an hour. When instead using ShockHash after an efficient k-perfect hash function, it achieves space usage similar to the best competitors, while being significantly faster to construct and query.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph","Independent"] },

We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning.

This paper demonstrates that (b)-bit minwise hashing provides an effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process. This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g., 10 to 100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3.

In this paper, we demonstrate, through an extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. As the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data, we show that the min-max kernel can be linearized via hashing techniques. This allows practitioners to apply min-max kernel to large-scale applications using well matured linear algorithms such as linear SVM or logistic regression. The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces samples in the form of ((i^<em>, t^</em>)) where the (i^<em>) records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the (t^</em>) is theoretically unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. In this paper, we provide a simple solution by discarding (t^*) (which we refer to as the 0-bit scheme). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information. We then apply the 0-bit CWS for building linear classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated on a wide range of publicly available classification datasets.

The effective use of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing (real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper, we focus on a simple 2-bit coding scheme. In particular, we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important practical applications. For example, in the task of near neighbor search, a crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed coding scheme and estimator. As a related task, in this paper, we also study a simple uniform quantization scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For example, when the target similarity level is high, 2 or 3 bits might be sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high, it is preferable to use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore, a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good choice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash tables.

Specifically, CE-Dedup associates a hashing-based image deduplication approach with downstream CNNs-based image classification tasks. CE-Dedup balances the tradeoff between a large deduplication ratio and a stable accuracy by adjusting the deduplication threshold. The effectiveness of CE-Dedup is validated through extensive experiments on well-known CNN benchmarks. On one hand, while maintaining the same validation accuracy, CE-Dedup can reduce the dataset size by 23%. On the other hand, when allowing a small validation accuracy drop (by 5%), CE-Dedup can trim the dataset size by 75%.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","CNN","Supervised"] },

As a consequence, their evaluation approaches vary from model to model, which makes it quite difficult to compare the explainability of different models. To achieve a standard way of evaluating recommendation explanations, we provide three benchmark datasets for EXplanaTion RAnking (denoted as EXTRA), on which explainability can be measured by ranking-oriented metrics. Constructing such datasets, however, poses great challenges. First, user-item-explanation triplet interactions are rare in existing recommender systems, so how to find alternatives becomes a challenge. Our solution is to identify nearly identical sentences from user reviews. This idea then leads to the second challenge, i.e., how to efficiently categorize the sentences in a dataset into different groups, since it has quadratic runtime complexity to estimate the similarity between any two sentences. To mitigate this issue, we provide a more efficient method based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) that can detect near-duplicates in sub-linear time for a given query.

Existing dense retrievers optimize representations of queries and documents with contrastive training and map them to the embedding space. The embedding space is optimized by aligning the matched query-document pairs and pushing the negative documents away from the query. However, in such training paradigm, the queries are only optimized to align to the documents and are coarsely positioned, leading to an anisotropic query embedding space. In this paper, we analyze the embedding space distributions and propose an effective training paradigm, Contrastive Dual Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (DANCE) to learn fine-grained query representations for dense retrieval. DANCE incorporates an additional dual training object of query retrieval, inspired by the classic information retrieval training axiom, query likelihood. With contrastive learning, the dual training object of DANCE learns more tailored representations for queries and documents to keep the embedding space smooth and uniform, thriving on the ranking performance of DANCE on the MS MARCO document retrieval task. Different from ANCE that only optimized with the document retrieval task, DANCE concentrates the query embeddings closer to document representations while making the document distribution more discriminative. Such concentrated query embedding distribution assigns more uniform negative sampling probabilities to queries and helps to sufficiently optimize query representations in the query retrieval task.

In addition, most of the existing methods choose to use an (n\\times n) similarity matrix for optimization, which makes the memory and computation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable Cross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues. It firstly introduces a collective matrix factorization to learn a common latent space from the kernelized features of different modalities, and then transforms the similarity matrix optimization to a distance-distance difference problem minimization with the help of semantic labels and common latent space. Hence, the computational complexity of the (n\\times n) asymmetric optimization is relieved. In the generation of hash codes we also employ an orthogonal constraint of label information, which is indispensable for search accuracy. So the redundancy of computation can be much reduced.

One common use of MinHash is for processing massive n-gram text representations so that practitioners do not have to materialize the original data (which would be prohibitive). Another popular use of MinHash is for building hash tables to enable sub-linear time approximate near neighbor (ANN) search. MinHash has also been used as a tool for building large-scale machine learning systems. The standard implementation of MinHash requires applying (K) random permutations. In comparison, the method of one permutation hashing (OPH), is an efficient alternative of MinHash which splits the data vectors into (K) bins and generates hash values within each bin. OPH is substantially more efficient and also more convenient to use. In this paper, we combine the differential privacy (DP) with OPH (as well as MinHash), to propose the DP-OPH framework with three variants: DP-OPH-fix, DP-OPH-re and DP-OPH-rand, depending on which densification strategy is adopted to deal with empty bins in OPH. A detailed roadmap to the algorithm design is presented along with the privacy analysis. An analytical comparison of our proposed DP-OPH methods with the DP minwise hashing (DP-MH) is provided to justify the advantage of DP-OPH. Experiments on similarity search confirm the merits of DP-OPH, and guide the choice of the proper variant in different practical scenarios.

Specifically, we first design a simple dual-stream structure, including a temporal layer and a hash layer.

A standard strategy is to use only the lowest (b) bits out of the (B) bits and somewhat increase (k), the number of hashes. In this study, we propose to re-use the hashes by partitioning the (B) bits into (m) chunks, e.g., (b\\times m =B). Correspondingly, the model size becomes (m\\times 2^b \\times k), which can be substantially smaller than the original (2^B\\times k). Our theoretical analysis reveals that by partitioning the hash values into (m) chunks, the accuracy would drop. In other words, using (m) chunks of (B/m) bits would not be as accurate as directly using (B) bits. This is due to the correlation from re-using the same hash. On the other hand, our analysis also shows that the accuracy would not drop much for (e.g.,) (m=2\\sim 4). In some regions, Pb-Hash still works well even for (m) much larger than 4. We expect Pb-Hash would be a good addition to the family of hashing methods/applications and benefit industrial practitioners. We verify the effectiveness of Pb-Hash in machine learning tasks, for linear SVM models as well as deep learning models. Since the hashed data are essentially categorical (ID) features, we follow the standard practice of using embedding tables for each hash.

Because the estimator of 0-bit CWS constitutes a positive definite kernel, this method can be naturally applied to large-scale data mining problems. Basically, if we feed the sampled data from 0-bit CWS to a highly efficient linear classifier (e.g., linear SVM), we effectively (and approximately) train a nonlinear classifier based on the min-max kernel. The accuracy improves as we increase the sample size. In this paper, we first demonstrate, through an extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. This helps justify the use of min-max kernel. However, as the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data, we propose to linearize the min-max kernel via 0-bit CWS, a simplification of the original CWS method. The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces samples in the form of (i<em>, t</em>) where the i* records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the t* is theoretically unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. We provide a simple solution by discarding t* (which we refer to as the 0-bit scheme). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information.

This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using a Hierarchical Bloom Filter Tree (HBFT) data structure to reduce the running time of collection-against-collection matching, with a specific focus on the MRSH-v2 algorithm. Three experiments are discussed, which explore the effects of different configurations of HBFTs. The proposed approach dramatically reduces the number of pairwise comparisons required, and demonstrates substantial speed gains, while maintaining effectiveness.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

A good image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two contradictory requirements: providing recall rates as high as possible and being as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image classification, descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place of the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with better retrieval performances. Nevertheless, the dimensionality of a typical DCNN descriptor –extracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the fully-connected layers– remains quite high at several thousands of scalar values. In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH), a fully unsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes –in the 32-256 bits range– from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two successive deep learning steps. First, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBM), a type of unsupervised deep neural nets, are used to learn binary embedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired bitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the expense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN descriptor space.

Second, large amounts of training batches are required to learn the up-to-date hash functions, which largely increase the learning complexity. To handle the above challenges, a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed Hadamard Matrix Guided Online Hashing (HMOH) is proposed in this paper. Our key innovation lies in introducing Hadamard matrix, which is an orthogonal binary matrix built via Sylvester method. In particular, to release the need of strong constraints, we regard each column of Hadamard matrix as the target code for each class label, which by nature satisfies several desired properties of hashing codes.

In this paper, a novel supervised online hashing scheme, termed Fast Class-wise Updating for Online Hashing (FCOH), is proposed to address the above two challenges by introducing a novel and efficient inner product operation. To achieve fast online adaptivity, a class-wise updating method is developed to decompose the binary code learning and alternatively renew the hash functions in a class-wise fashion, which well addresses the burden on large amounts of training batches. Quantitatively, such a decomposition further leads to at least 75% storage saving. To further achieve online efficiency, we propose a semi-relaxation optimization, which accelerates the online training by treating different binary constraints independently. Without additional constraints and variables, the time complexity is significantly reduced. Such a scheme is also quantitatively shown to well preserve past information during updating hashing functions.

However, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a Deep Self-Adaptive Hashing (DSAH) model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two special designs: Adaptive Neighbor Discovery (AND) and Pairwise Information Content (PIC). Firstly, we adopt the AND to initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix, and then refine this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly, we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to them, which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain more discriminative information for hash learning.

Firstly, DSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained semantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM), where an image is represented as a mixture of multiple components, and the semantics co-occurrence are exploited. Besides, coarse-grained semantics components, are discovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained components, and the hierarchy organization is then constructed.

Then, we design a struct layer rather than a bottleneck hash layer, to obtain binary codes through a simple encoding procedure. By doing these, we are able to obtain binary codes discriminatively and generatively. To make it applicable to cross-modal scalable multimedia retrieval, we extend our method to a cross-modal deep variational and structural hashing (CM-DVStH). We design a deep fusion network with a struct layer to maximize the correlation between image-text input pairs during the training stage so that a unified binary vector can be obtained. We then design modality-specific hashing networks to handle the out-of-sample extension scenario.

Existing cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence between training samples across modalities are readily available. This assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition, these methods generally require the same number of samples across different modalities, which restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data, whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster, and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact of an incomplete correspondence, it jointly optimizes in a unified objective function the potential correspondence, the cross-modal hashing functions derived from the correspondence, and a hashing quantitative loss. An alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the correspondence and hash functions, and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of the two objectives. Experiments on publicly multi-modal datasets show that FlexCMH achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods, and it indeed offers a high degree of flexibility for practical cross-modal hashing tasks.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Cross Modal","Unsupervised"] },

To tackle these issues, we formulate the learning of similarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic data so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming space, and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH) approach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically, FDDH introduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training examples to their corresponding semantic labels, and utilizes -dragging technique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly, the discriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and maximized. Moreover, an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to map the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace, which can well guarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic representation. Consequently, an efficient closed form solution is derived for discriminative hash code learning, which is very computationally efficient. In addition, an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for optimizing modality-specific projection functions, featuring adaptivity to different training sizes and streaming data.

However, it is indeed problematic to directly minimize such error, since such mentioned two metric spaces are heterogeneous, and the quasi-isometric mapping is non-linear. The former leads to inconsistent feature distributions, while the latter leads to problematic optimization issues. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method, termed Sparsity-Induced Generative Adversarial Hashing (SiGAH), to encode large-scale high-dimensional features into binary codes, which well solves the two problems through a generative adversarial training framework. Instead of minimizing the quantization loss, our key innovation lies in enforcing the learned Hamming space to have similar data distribution to the target metric space via a generative model. In particular, we formulate a ReLU-based neural network as a generator to output binary codes and an MSE-loss based auto-encoder network as a discriminator, upon which a generative adversarial learning is carried out to train hash functions. Furthermore, to generate the synthetic features from the hash codes, a compressed sensing procedure is introduced into the generative model, which enforces the reconstruction boundary of binary codes to be consistent with that of original features.

In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses, i.e., triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks, including cross-domain digits retrieval, image to image and image to video transfers, on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","CNN","Cross Modal","Supervised"] },

Most existing deep hashing approaches adopt one-to-one quantization to reduce information loss. However, such class-unrelated quantization cannot give discriminative feedback for network training. In addition, these methods only utilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing function learning, which may result in inferior network generalization performance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class information of data is totally ignored. In this paper, we propose a dual semantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method, which generates discriminative hash codes under three-fold constraints. Firstly, DSAH utilizes class prior to conduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during the quantization process. Secondly, a simple yet effective label mechanism is designed to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of data, thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code learning. Finally, a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised to minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an affinity graph. With these three main components, high-quality hash codes can be generated through network.

Such retrieval problem requires: 1) an efficient mechanism to calculate the distances/dissimilarities between sets, and 2) an appropriate data structure for fast nearest neighbor search.

However, existing hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two crucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains, leading to an inevitable {domain distribution gap}; 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional {feature gap}. To address the GITR problem, we propose an Asymmetric Transfer Hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised realizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate negative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph.

Compared with supervised methods, unsupervised hashing methods are more reasonable and suitable for large-scale image retrieval since it is always difficult and expensive to collect true labels of the massive data. Without label information, however, unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH), which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part, we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part, a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore, the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes, hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework.

Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity.

Sophisticated similarity measures are standard for time series matching, as they are usually misaligned. Dynamic Time Warping or DTW is the most widely used similarity measure for time series because it combines alignment and matching at the same time. However, the alignment makes DTW slow. To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW, branch and bound based pruning strategies are adopted. However, branch and bound based pruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series), and the bounds are quite weak for longer queries. Due to the loose bounds branch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search. To circumvent this issue, we design SSH (Sketch, Shingle, &amp; Hashing), an efficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the state-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique: the UCR suite. SSH uses a novel combination of sketching, shingling and hashing techniques to produce (probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity measure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for sub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time sequence and prunes around 95% candidates, leading to the massive speedup in search with DTW.

HW-Forest employs perceptual hashing algorithm to calculate the similarity between feature vectors in hashing screening strategy, which is used to remove the redundant feature vectors produced by multi-grained scanning and can significantly decrease the time cost and memory consumption. Furthermore, we adopt a self-adaptive instance screening strategy to improve the performance of our approach, called window screening, which can achieve higher accuracy without hyperparameter tuning on different datasets.

Nevertheless, hybrid fusion techniques that integrate sparse and dense retrieval models need to stitch together results from two completely different software stacks, which creates unnecessary complexities and inefficiencies.

However, little is known about the metric space of all (k)-mers equipped with the edit distance. In this work, we explore the structure of the (k)-mer space by studying its maximal independent sets (MISs). An MIS is a sparse sketch of all (k)-mers with nice theoretical properties, and therefore admits critical applications in clustering, indexing, hashing, and sketching large-scale sequencing data, particularly those with high error-rates. Finding an MIS is a challenging problem, as the size of a (k)-mer space grows geometrically with respect to (k). We propose three algorithms for this problem. The first and the most intuitive one uses a greedy strategy. The second method implements two techniques to avoid redundant comparisons by taking advantage of the locality-property of the (k)-mer space and the estimated bounds on the edit distance. The last algorithm avoids expensive calculations of the edit distance by translating the edit distance into the shortest path in a specifically designed graph. These algorithms are implemented and the calculated MISs of (k)-mer spaces and their statistical properties are reported and analyzed for (k) up to 15.

The majority of recent approaches usually reconstruct semantic similarity information, which then guides the hash code learning. However, they still fail to achieve satisfactory performance in reality for two reasons. On the one hand, without accurate supervised information, these methods usually fail to produce independent and robust hash codes with semantics information well preserved, which may hinder effective image retrieval. On the other hand, due to discrete constraints, how to effectively optimize the hashing network in an end-to-end manner with small quantization errors remains a problem. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method called HARR to learn discriminative and high-quality hash codes. To comprehensively explore semantic similarity structure, HARR adopts the Winner-Take-All hash to model the similarity structure. Then similarity-preserving hash codes are learned under the reliable guidance of the reconstructed similarity structure. Additionally, we improve the quality of hash codes by a bit correlation reduction module, which forces the cross-correlation matrix between a batch of hash codes under different augmentations to approach the identity matrix. In this way, the generated hash bits are expected to be invariant to disturbances with minimal redundancy, which can be further interpreted as an instantiation of the information bottleneck principle. Finally, for effective hashing network training, we minimize the cosine distances between real-value network outputs and their binary codes for small quantization errors.

In this paper, we propose a novel progressive generative hashing (PGH) framework to help learn a discriminative hashing network in an unsupervised way. Different from existing studies, it first treats the hash codes as a kind of semantic condition for the similar image generation, and simultaneously feeds the original image and its codes into the generative adversarial networks (GANs). The real images together with the synthetic ones can further help train a discriminative hashing network based on a triplet loss.

In particular, hash values of large collections can be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding. Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature are hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of 2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual hash functions), and they are also quite slow. In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one hand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values provide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a highly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical evaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per second on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level—many times faster than previous practical methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

In contrast to known lock-based hash table algorithms, the proposed algorithm separates the resizing and rehashing stages so that they neither invalidate existing buckets nor block any concurrent operations. Instead, the rehashing work is deferred and split across subsequent operations with the table. The rehashing operation uses bucket-level synchronization only and therefore allows a race condition between lookup and moving operations running in different threads. Instead of using explicit synchronization, the algorithm detects the race condition and restarts the lookup operation. In comparison with other lock-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces high-level synchronization on the hot path, improving performance, concurrency, and scalability of the table. The response time of the operations is also more predictable. The algorithm is compatible with cache friendly data layouts for buckets and does not depend on any memory reclamation techniques thus potentially achieving additional performance gain with corresponding implementations.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

Previous approaches to this problem either rely on very large (superconstant) approximation ratios (c), or very small search radii (r).

The goal of ANN is to preprocess a set S so that, given a query q, we can find a point y whose distance from q approximates the smallest distance from q to any point in S. For most distance functions, the best-known ANN bounds for high-dimensional point sets are obtained using techniques based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). Unfortunately, space efficiency is a major challenge for LSH-based data structures. Classic LSH techniques require a very large amount of space, oftentimes polynomial in |S|. A long line of work has developed intricate techniques to reduce this space usage, but these techniques suffer from downsides: they must be hand tailored to each specific LSH, are often complicated, and their space reduction comes at the cost of significantly increased query times. In this paper we explore a new way to improve the space efficiency of LSH using function inversion techniques, originally developed in (Fiat and Naor 2000). We begin by describing how function inversion can be used to improve LSH data structures. This gives a fairly simple, black box method to reduce LSH space usage. Then, we give a data structure that leverages function inversion to improve the query time of the best known near-linear space data structure for approximate nearest neighbor search under Euclidean distance: the ALRW data structure of (Andoni, Laarhoven, Razenshteyn, and Waingarten 2017).

Model counting is a fundamental but hard problem in computer science with varied applications. Recent years have witnessed a surge of effort towards developing efficient algorithmic techniques that combine the classical 2-universal hashing with the remarkable progress in SAT solving over the past decade. These techniques augment the CNF formula F with random XOR constraints and invoke an NP oracle repeatedly on the resultant CNF-XOR formulas. In practice, calls to the NP oracle calls are replaced a SAT solver whose runtime performance is adversely affected by size of XOR constraints. The standard construction of 2-universal hash functions chooses every variable with probability p = 1/2 leading to XOR constraints of size n/2 in expectation. Consequently, the challenge is to design sparse hash functions where variables can be chosen with smaller probability and lead to smaller sized XOR constraints. In this paper, we address this challenge from theoretical and practical perspectives. First, we formalize a relaxation of universal hashing, called concentrated hashing and establish a novel and beautiful connection between concentration measures of these hash functions and isoperimetric inequalities on boolean hypercubes. This allows us to obtain (log m) tight bounds on variance and dispersion index and show that p = O( log(m)/m ) suffices for design of sparse hash functions from {0, 1}^n to {0, 1}^m. We then use sparse hash functions belonging to this concentrated hash family to develop new approximate counting algorithms.

This introduces additional cost in the form of computational overhead and requires training data to be available. To this end, we propose HASTE (Hashing for Tractable Efficiency), a parameter-free and data-free module that acts as a plug-and-play replacement for any regular convolution module. It instantly reduces the network’s test-time inference cost without requiring any training or fine-tuning. We are able to drastically compress latent feature maps without sacrificing much accuracy by using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to detect redundancies in the channel dimension. Similar channels are aggregated to reduce the input and filter depth simultaneously, allowing for cheaper convolutions. We demonstrate our approach on the popular vision benchmarks CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps: bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes, followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space, allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds, or vice-versa.

Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds: 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation, which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue, we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning.

Typically, one considers d tending to infinity, with c fixed and q bounded away from 0. For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its rho parameter rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c, the extremely simple family H = {x -&gt; x_i : i in d} achieves rho at most 1/c.

The most important factor in speed is the number of cache lines accessed during updates and queries. This is especially important on PMEM, which is slower than DRAM and in which writes are more expensive than reads. This paper proposes two stronger design objectives: stability and low-associativity. A stable hash table doesn’t move items around, and a hash table has low associativity if there are only a few locations where an item can be stored. Low associativity ensures that queries need to examine only a few memory locations, and stability ensures that insertions write to very few cache lines. Stability also simplifies scaling and crash safety. We present IcebergHT, a fast, crash-safe, concurrent, and space-efficient hash table for PMEM based on the design principles of stability and low associativity. IcebergHT combines in-memory metadata with a new hashing technique, iceberg hashing, that is (1) space efficient, (2) stable, and (3) supports low associativity. In contrast, existing hash-tables either modify numerous cache lines during insertions (e.g. cuckoo hashing), access numerous cache lines during queries (e.g. linear probing), or waste space (e.g. chaining).

An embedding layer maps each entity to a unique vector, causing the layer’s memory requirement to be proportional to the number of entities. In the recommendation domain, a given category can have hundreds of thousands of entities, and its embedding layer can take gigabytes of memory. The scale of these networks makes them difficult to deploy in resource constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing the size of an embedding table while still mapping each entity to its own unique embedding. Rather than maintaining the full embedding table, we construct each entity’s embedding on the fly using two separate embedding tables. The first table employs hashing to force multiple entities to share an embedding. The second table contains one trainable weight per entity, allowing the model to distinguish between entities sharing the same embedding. Since these two tables are trained jointly, the network is able to learn a unique embedding per entity, helping it maintain a discriminative capability similar to a model with an uncompressed embedding table.

These approaches can be split into a dictionary learning phase and a feature encoding phase which are often closely connected. In this paper, we investigate the effects of these phases by separating them for video-based action classification. We compare several dictionary learning methods and feature encoding schemes through extensive experiments on KTH and HMDB51 datasets. Experimental results indicate that sparse coding performs consistently better than the other encoding methods in large complex dataset (i.e., HMDB51), and it is robust to different dictionaries. For small simple dataset (i.e., KTH) with less variation, however, all the encoding strategies perform competitively. In addition, we note that the strength of sophisticated encoding approaches comes not from their corresponding dictionaries but the encoding mechanisms, and we can just use randomly selected exemplars as dictionaries for video-based action classification.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Quantisation","Unsupervised"] },
{"key": "peng2014fast", "year": "2014", "title":"Fast Low-rank Representation Based Spatial Pyramid Matching For Image Classification", "abstract": "<p>Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) and its variants have achieved a lot of success in image classification. The main difference among them is their encoding schemes. For example, ScSPM incorporates Sparse Code (SC) instead of Vector Quantization (VQ) into the framework of SPM. Although the methods achieve a higher recognition rate than the traditional SPM, they consume more time to encode the local descriptors extracted from the image. In this paper, we propose using Low Rank Representation (LRR) to encode the descriptors under the framework of SPM. Different from SC, LRR considers the group effect among data points instead of sparsity. Benefiting from this property, the proposed method (i.e., LrrSPM) can offer a better performance. To further improve the generalizability and robustness, we reformulate the rank-minimization problem as a truncated projection problem. Extensive experimental studies show that LrrSPM is more efficient than its counterparts (e.g., ScSPM) while achieving competitive recognition rates on nine image data sets.</p>\n", "tags": ["Quantisation","Supervised"] },

However, most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of hashing functions independently, while ignore the correlations between different hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly. Inspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning, we propose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH). Our proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential decision process, which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors imposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep reinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed DRLIH approach can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a deep reinforcement learning hashing network. In the proposed network, we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) as agents to model the hashing functions, which take actions of projecting images into binary codes sequentially, so that the current hashing function learning can take previous hashing functions’ error into account. (2) We propose a sequential learning strategy based on proposed DRLIH. We define the state as a tuple of internal features of RNN’s hidden layers and image features, which can reflect history decisions made by the agents. We also propose an action group method to enhance the correlation of hash functions in the same group.

PTHash is one such algorithm, achieving very fast evaluation in compressed space, typically several times faster than other techniques.

The challenge is to design an algorithm which is efficient in three different aspects: time to find (f) (construction time), time to evaluate (f) on a key of (S) (lookup time), and space of representation for (f). Several algorithms have been proposed to trade-off between these aspects. In 1992, Fox, Chen, and Heath (FCH) presented an algorithm at SIGIR providing very fast lookup evaluation. However, the approach received little attention because of its large construction time and higher space consumption compared to other subsequent techniques. Almost thirty years later we revisit their framework and present an improved algorithm that scales well to large sets and reduces space consumption altogether, without compromising the lookup time.

It is well-known that (n\\log_2(e)) bits are necessary to specify a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) (f), when no additional knowledge of the input keys is to be used. However, it is often the case in practice that the input keys have intrinsic relationships that we can exploit to lower the bit complexity of (f).

Moreover, we would like (f) to map consecutive (k)-mers to consecutive addresses, as to also preserve as much as possible their relationship in the codomain. This is a useful feature in practice as it guarantees a certain degree of locality of reference for (f), resulting in a better evaluation time when querying consecutive (k)-mers. Motivated by these premises, we initiate the study of a new type of locality-preserving MPHF designed for (k)-mers extracted consecutively from a collection of strings. We design a construction whose space usage decreases for growing (k) and discuss experiments with a practical implementation of the method: in practice, the functions built with our method can be several times smaller and even faster to query than the most efficient MPHFs in the literature.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

However, despite previous efforts to find good prototypes, how to select the best representation set remains an open issue. In this paper we proposed scalable methods to select the set of prototypes out of very large datasets.

In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo hashing, the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets. Each item is hashed to two buckets, and may be stored in any of the positions within those buckets. Ref. [2] analyzed a variation in which the buckets are contiguous and overlap. However, many systems retrieve data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively expensive process; but once a page is fetched, its contents can be accessed orders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval, presenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint: each bucket must be fully contained in a single page, but buckets are not necessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases memory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an item. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two, the page size is 8, and each bucket is fully contained in a single page, the memory utilization equals 89.71% in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant, 93.78% in the contiguous overlapping bucket variant, and increases to 97.46% in our new non-contiguous bucket variant. When the memory utilization is 92% and we use breadth first search to look for a vacant position, the number of iterations required to insert a new item is dramatically reduced from 545 in the contiguous overlapping buckets variant to 52 in our new non-contiguous bucket variant. In addition to the empirical results, we present a theoretical lower bound on the memory utilization of our variation as a function of the page size.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

Moreover, hashing with handcrafted features as done in many existing works is clearly inadequate to achieve desirable performance for this task. To address such problems, we present an end-to-end Deep Heterogeneous Hashing (DHH) method that integrates three stages including image feature learning, video modeling, and heterogeneous hashing in a single framework, to learn unified binary codes for both face images and videos.

In this paper, we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests, with near-optimal information-theoretic code aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme, where random trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting 1’ for the visited tree leaf, and 0’ for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees, rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this, we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem, which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class distance for the two random class groups.

Neural networks can accurately capture these correlations, allowing an adversary to reconstruct the data. This emphasizes the need for continued research into securing VFL systems. Our work shows that hashing is a promising solution to counter data reconstruction attacks. The one-way nature of hashing makes it difficult for an adversary to recover data from hash codes. However, implementing hashing in VFL presents new challenges, including vanishing gradients and information loss. To address these issues, we propose HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency.

In a distributed setting, deferring LSH analysis to a centralized host is (i) slow if the device cluster is large and (ii) requires access to input data which is forbidden in a federated context. Using a new family of hash functions, we develop one of the first private, personalized, and memory-efficient on-device LSH frameworks. Our framework enables privacy and personalization by allowing each device to generate hash tables, without the help of a central host, using device-specific hashing hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hash tables or hash length). Hash tables are generated with a compressed set of the full weights, and can be serially generated and discarded if the process is memory-intensive. This allows devices to avoid maintaining (i) the fully-sized model and (ii) large amounts of hash tables in local memory for LSH analysis.

The resulting algorithm can be seen as an iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this, our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower, as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition, our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval","NEURIPS","Supervised"] },

Existing knowledge distillation methods use logits and other features of the deep (teacher) model and as knowledge for the compact (student) model, which requires the teacher’s network to be fine-tuned on the context in parallel with the student model on the context. Training teacher on the target context requires more time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose context unaware knowledge distillation that uses the knowledge of the teacher model without fine-tuning it on the target context. We also propose a new efficient student model architecture for knowledge distillation. The proposed approach follows a two-step process. The first step involves pre-training the student model with the help of context unaware knowledge distillation from the teacher model. The second step involves fine-tuning the student model on the context of image retrieval. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed approach, we compare the retrieval results, no. of parameters and no. of operations of the student models with the teacher models under different retrieval frameworks, including deep cauchy hashing (DCH) and central similarity quantization (CSQ).

It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLSH, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist.

The emergence of heterogeneous memory (HM) brings a solution to significantly increase memory capacity and break the above tradeoff: Using HM, billions of data points can be placed in the main memory on a single machine without using any data compression. However, HM consists of both fast (but small) memory and slow (but large) memory, and using HM inappropriately slows down query significantly. In this work, we present a novel graph-based similarity search algorithm called HM-ANN, which takes both memory and data heterogeneity into consideration and enables billion-scale similarity search on a single node without using compression. On two billion-sized datasets BIGANN and DEEP1B, HM-ANN outperforms state-of-the-art compression-based solutions such as L&amp;C and IMI+OPQ in recall-vs-latency by a large margin, obtaining 46% higher recall under the same search latency.

In this paper, we propose the use of product quantization for efficient similarity-based comparison of time series under time warping. The idea is to first compress the data by partitioning the time series into equal length sub-sequences which are represented by a short code. The distance between two time series can then be efficiently approximated by pre-computed elastic distances between their codes.

While maximizing recall of relevant items is usually the goal of retrieval systems, a low precision may lead to a poor search experience. Unlike lexical retrieval, which inherently limits the size of the retrieved set through keyword matching, dense retrieval via ANN search has no natural cutoff. Moreover, the cosine similarity scores of embedding vectors are often optimized via contrastive or ranking losses, which make them difficult to interpret. Consequently, relying on top-K or cosine-similarity cutoff is often insufficient to filter out irrelevant results effectively. This issue is prominent in product search, where the number of relevant products is often small. This paper introduces a novel relevance filtering component (called Cosine Adapter) for embedding-based retrieval to address this challenge. Our approach maps raw cosine similarity scores to interpretable scores using a query-dependent mapping function. We then apply a global threshold on the mapped scores to filter out irrelevant results. We are able to significantly increase the precision of the retrieved set, at the expense of a small loss of recall.

In this paper, we present BayesLSH, a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant, BayesLSH-Lite, which calculates similarities exactly, is also presented. BayesLSH is able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs, leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH, we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output, both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally, the quality of BayesLSH’s output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation, unlike standard approaches.

Similarity search for images is performed by determining the vectors with the smallest distances to a query vector. However, high retrieval quality does not depend on the actual distances of the feature vectors, but rather on the ranking order of the feature vectors from similar images. In this paper, we introduce a metric learning algorithm that focuses on identifying and modifying those feature vectors that most strongly affect the retrieval quality. We compute normalized approximated ranks and convert them to similarities by applying a nonlinear transfer function. These similarities are used in a newly proposed loss function that better contracts similar and disperses dissimilar samples.

This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing CLIP models for various image-based similarity search scenarios, while maintaining their effectiveness in text-based search tasks such as text-to-image retrieval and zero-shot classification. We propose and evaluate two novel methods aimed at refining the retrieval capabilities of CLIP without compromising the alignment between text and image embeddings. The first method involves a sequential fine-tuning process: initially optimizing the image encoder for more precise image retrieval and subsequently realigning the text encoder to these optimized image embeddings. The second approach integrates pseudo-captions during the retrieval-optimization phase to foster direct alignment within the embedding space. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that these methods enhance CLIP’s performance on various benchmarks, including image retrieval, k-NN classification, and zero-shot text-based classification, while maintaining robustness in text-to-image retrieval.

In practical scenarios, those labels are not always available or one requires a method that can handle a higher input variability, as well as a higher granularity.

Such algorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a subsequent costly binarization step, a common solution is to employ loss functions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are grouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that the embedding entries are close to binarized entries, e.g., -1 or 1). Still, the interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the embeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that decomposes the learning problem in two stages: first, perform similarity learning over the embedding space with no quantization; second, find an optimal orthogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding is close to its sign, and then quantize the transformed embedding through the sign function. In the second step, we parametrize orthogonal transformations using Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent. Since similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal transformations, this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of performance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised, fast, hyperparameter-free and can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning algorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets, and, unlike other quantization strategies, brings consistent improvements in performance to existing deep hashing algorithms.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning","Quantisation","Unsupervised"] },

The problem is often addressed by using streaming algorithms with sublinear space data structures. These algorithms allow processing of large data while using limited data storage. Commonly used streaming algorithms, such as count-min sketch, have many advantages, but do not take into account properties of a data stream for performance optimization. In the present paper we introduce a novel double-hashing algorithm that provides flexibility to optimize streaming algorithms depending on the properties of a given stream. In the double-hashing approach, first a standard streaming algorithm is employed to obtain an estimate of the element frequencies. This estimate is derived using a fraction of the stream and allows identification of the heavy hitters. Next, it uses a modified hash table where the heavy hitters are mapped into individual buckets and other stream elements are mapped into the remaining buckets. Finally, the element frequencies are estimated based on the constructed hash table over the entire data stream with any streaming algorithm. We demonstrate on both synthetic data and an internet query log dataset that our approach is capable of improving frequency estimation due to removing heavy hitters from the hashing process and, thus, reducing collisions in the hash table. Our approach avoids employing additional machine learning models to identify heavy hitters and, thus, reduces algorithm complexity and streamlines implementation. Moreover, because it is not dependent on specific features of the stream elements for identifying heavy hitters, it is applicable to a large variety of streams. In addition, we propose a procedure on how to dynamically adjust the proposed double-hashing algorithm when frequencies of the elements in a stream are changing over time.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

However, these methods do not provide useful information when a gene does not have a close match in the database. In addition, each comparison can be costly when the database is large since it requires alignments and a series of string comparisons. In this work we propose a novel approach: using recurrent neural networks to embed DNA or amino-acid sequences in a low-dimensional space in which distances correlate with functional similarity. This embedding space overcomes both shortcomings of the method of aligning sequences and comparing homology. First, it allows us to obtain information about genes which do not have exact matches by measuring their similarity to other ones in the database. If our database is labeled this can provide labels for a query gene as is done in traditional methods. However, even if the database is unlabeled it allows us to find clusters and infer some characteristics of the gene population. In addition, each comparison is much faster than traditional methods since the distance metric is reduced to the Euclidean distance, and thus efficient approximate nearest neighbor algorithms can be used to find the best match. We present results showing the advantage of our algorithm. More specifically we show how our embedding can be useful for both classification tasks when our labels are known, and clustering tasks where our sequences belong to classes which have not been seen before.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Deep Learning","Supervised"] },

These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing.

In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g., text n-grams), minwise hashing is widely adopted, which requires applying a large number of permutations on the data. This is costly in computation and energy-consumption. In this paper, we propose a hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search, using one single permutation. The heart of the proposed hash function is a rotation scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of one permutation hashing (Li et al., 2012) in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent interest for densifying other types of sparse sketches. Using our proposed hashing method, the query time of a (K, L)-parameterized LSH is reduced from the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely O(KL + dL), where d is the number of nonzeros of the data vector, K is the number of hashes in each hash table, and L is the number of hash tables.

Across these diverse applications, the overwhelming majority of work relies on N-grams. Limited efforts have been made to evaluate how well N-gram methods perform, in part because it is unclear how one could create an unbiased evaluation dataset for a massive corpus. This study uses the unique timeliness of historical news wires to create a 27,210 document dataset, with 122,876 positive duplicate pairs, for studying noise-robust de-duplication. The time-sensitivity of news makes comprehensive hand labelling feasible - despite the massive overall size of the corpus - as duplicates occur within a narrow date range. The study then develops and evaluates a range of de-duplication methods: hashing and N-gram overlap (which predominate in the literature), a contrastively trained bi-encoder, and a re-rank style approach combining a bi- and cross-encoder. The neural approaches significantly outperform hashing and N-gram overlap. We show that the bi-encoder scales well, de-duplicating a 10 million article corpus on a single GPU card in a matter of hours.

Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method has achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand, various deep neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images. On the other hand, the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way. However, with the number of database samples increasing, it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of large-scale database images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL), for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail, the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network, while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition, we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network, which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

It has been demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that leverage supervised information can significantly enhance the coding quality, and hence greatly benefit visual search tasks. Typically, a modern binary coding method seeks to learn a group of coding functions which compress data samples into binary codes. However, few methods pursued the coding functions such that the precision at the top of a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach, namely Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC), which explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train the disciplined coding functions, by which the mistakes at the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions, we relax the original discrete optimization objective with a continuous surrogate, and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost, we also design an online learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more efficiently.

These architectures require giant matrix multiplication operations to train millions of parameters. Conversely, there is another growing trend to bring deep learning to low-power, embedded devices. The matrix operations, associated with both training and testing of deep networks, are very expensive from a computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel hashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of computation needed to train and test deep networks. Our approach combines recent ideas from adaptive dropouts and randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to select the nodes with the highest activation efficiently. Our new algorithm for deep learning reduces the overall computational cost of forward and back-propagation by operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a consequence, our algorithm uses only 5% of the total multiplications, while keeping on average within 1% of the accuracy of the original model. A unique property of the proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates are always sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our algorithm is ideally suited for asynchronous and parallel training leading to near linear speedup with increasing number of cores.

The first one is related to the detection of products with various types of potentially objectionable themes. This application is run with a sense of urgency, hence the typical time frame to train and bootstrap a model is not permitted.

A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented by (k) (d)-dimensional embeddings vectors and one (k) dimensional weight vector. The final (d) dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of (B) embedding vectors. Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding, hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Independent"] },

The recent CBIR research trend favors the construction and use of binary codes to represent images. Deep architectures could learn the non-linear relationship among image pixels adaptively, allowing the automatic learning of high-level features from raw pixels. However, most of them require class labels, which are expensive to obtain, particularly for medical images. The methods which do not need class labels utilize a deep autoencoder for binary hashing, but the code construction involves a specific training algorithm and an ad-hoc regularization technique. In this study, we explored using a deep de-noising autoencoder (DDA), with a new unsupervised training scheme using only backpropagation and dropout, to hash images into binary codes. We conducted experiments on more than 14,000 x-ray images. By using class labels only for evaluating the retrieval results, we constructed a 16-bit DDA and a 512-bit DDA independently. Comparing to other unsupervised methods, we succeeded to obtain the lowest total error by using the 512-bit codes for retrieval via exhaustive search, and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the 16-bit codes while keeping a comparable total error. We found that our new training scheme could reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9%. To further boost the image retrieval performance, we developed Radon Autoencoder Barcode (RABC) which are learned from the Radon projections of images using a de-noising autoencoder.

We integrate a deep hashing (binarization) technique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal shared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture by combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate it with a deep hashing framework, which makes it computationally prohibitive to forge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication.

This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation, scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a saliency graph connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph, that is, its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly, this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image, making the hash robust to image transformation, yet distinct for different visual content.

A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard similarity f=|A intersect B|/|A union B| between sets A and B. Given the bottom-k samples from A and B, we construct the bottom-k sample of their union as S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)), and then the similarity is estimated as |S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)|/k.

Here we survey recent results on how simple hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees. Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist [1970]. Keys are viewed as consisting of (c) characters and we have precomputed character tables (h_1,…,h_c) mapping characters to random hash values. A key (x=(x_1,…,x_c)) is hashed to (h_1[x_1] \\oplus h_2[x_2]…..\\oplus h_c[x_c]). This schemes is very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even 4-independent, it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally obtained via higher independence, e.g., linear probing and Cuckoo hashing. Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is twisted in a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional properties: Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and data-structures. Finally, we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation functions, applying one to the output of the other, and show that this yields very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman [1977]. In fact, w.h.p., for a given set of size proportional to that of the space consumed, double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given time and space.

In this paper, we propose a novel indexing approach called LIMS that uses data clustering, pivot-based data transformation techniques and learned indexes to support efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces.

Data redistribution is achieved by utilizing a small number of pivots for each cluster. Similar data are mapped into compact regions and the mapped values are totally ordinal. Machine learning models are developed to approximate the position of each data record on disk.

We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding.

In this paper, we put forward the idea of autoencoded Radon barcodes. Using images in a training dataset, we autoencode Radon projections to perform binarization on outputs of hidden layers. We employed the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent approach for the training.

In this paper we investigate whether we can effectively approach this task as a classification problem, thus bypassing the need for a similarity search. We find that existing classification methods for coarse, planet-wide localization are not suitable for the fine-grained and city-wide setting. This is largely due to how the dataset is split into classes, because these methods are designed to handle a sparse distribution of photos and as such do not consider the visual aliasing problem across neighbouring classes that naturally arises in dense scenarios.

Part of our contribution is that we consider three different settings, differing in the way in which one may access the neighborhood of a given vertex. In previous work, people have considered indexed neighbor access, with a query returning the (i)-th neighbor of a given vertex. Full neighborhood access model, which has a query that returns the entire neighborhood at a unit cost, has recently been considered in the applied community. Between these, we propose hash-ordered neighbor access, inspired by coordinated sampling, where we have a global fully random hash function, and can access neighbors in order of their hash values, paying a constant for each accessed neighbor. For edge sampling and counting, our new lower bounds are in the most powerful full neighborhood access model. We provide matching upper bounds in the weaker hash-ordered neighbor access model. Our new faster algorithms can be provably implemented efficiently on massive graphs in external memory and with the current APIs for, e.g., Twitter or Wikipedia. For triangle counting, we provide a separation: a better upper bound with full neighborhood access than the known lower bounds with indexed neighbor access. The technical core of our paper is our edge-sampling algorithm on which the other results depend.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Graph","Independent"] },

FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular fashion.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Unsupervised"] },

Most existing privacy-preserving string comparison functions are either based on comparing sets of encoded character q-grams, allow only exact matching of encrypted strings, or they are aimed at long genomic sequences that have a small alphabet. The set-based privacy-preserving similarity functions commonly used to compare name and address strings in the context of privacy-preserving record linkage do not take the positions of sub-strings into account. As a result, two very different strings can potentially be considered as an exact match leading to wrongly linked records. Existing set-based techniques also cannot identify the length of the longest common sub-string across two strings. In this paper we propose a novel approach for accurate and efficient privacy-preserving string matching based on suffix trees that are encoded using chained hashing. We incorporate a hashing based encoding technique upon the encoded suffixes to improve privacy against frequency attacks such as those exploiting Benford’s law. Our approach allows various operations to be performed without the strings to be compared being revealed: the length of the longest common sub-string, do two strings have the same beginning, middle or end, and the longest common sub-string similarity between two strings. These functions allow a more accurate comparison of, for example, bank account, credit card, or telephone numbers, which cannot be compared appropriately with existing privacy-preserving string matching techniques. Our evaluation on several data sets with different types of strings validates the privacy and accuracy of our proposed approach.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"] },

However, learning accurate hash codes for video retrieval can be challenging due to high local redundancy and complex global dependencies between video frames, especially in the absence of labels. Existing self-supervised video hashing methods have been effective in designing expressive temporal encoders, but have not fully utilized the temporal dynamics and spatial appearance of videos due to less challenging and unreliable learning tasks. To address these challenges, we begin by utilizing the contrastive learning task to capture global spatio-temporal information of videos for hashing. With the aid of our designed augmentation strategies, which focus on spatial and temporal variations to create positive pairs, the learning framework can generate hash codes that are invariant to motion, scale, and viewpoint. Furthermore, we incorporate two collaborative learning tasks, i.e., frame order verification and scene change regularization, to capture local spatio-temporal details within video frames, thereby enhancing the perception of temporal structure and the modeling of spatio-temporal relationships.

Simply applying existing cross-modal approaches to this new task fails to adequately capture latent multi-modal semantics and effectively bridge the modality gap between 2D and 3D. To address these issues without relying on hand-crafted labels, we propose contrastive masked autoencoders based self-supervised hashing (CMAH) for retrieval between images and point-cloud data. We start by contrasting 2D-3D pairs and explicitly constraining them into a joint Hamming space. This contrastive learning process ensures robust discriminability for the generated hash codes and effectively reduces the modality gap. Moreover, we utilize multi-modal auto-encoders to enhance the model’s understanding of multi-modal semantics. By completing the masked image/point-cloud data modeling task, the model is encouraged to capture more localized clues. In addition, the proposed multi-modal fusion block facilitates fine-grained interactions among different modalities.

As a blockchain system can be useful for maintaining data integrity, image authentication has the potential to be enhanced by blockchain. There are many techniques that can be used to authenticate images; the technique investigated by this work is image hashing. Image hashing is a technique used to calculate how similar two different images are. This is done by converting the images into hashes and then comparing them using a distance formula. To investigate the topic, an experiment involving a simulated blockchain was created. The blockchain acted as a database for images. This blockchain was made up of devices which contained their own unique image hashing algorithms. The blockchain was tested by creating modified copies of the images contained in the database, and then submitting them to the blockchain to see if it will return the original image.

In such cases, the hashing techniques have been verified to efficiently conduct similarity estimation in terms of both theory and practice. Currently, MinHash is a popular technique for efficiently estimating the Jaccard similarity of binary sets and furthermore, weighted MinHash is generalized to estimate the generalized Jaccard similarity of weighted sets. This review focuses on categorizing and discussing the existing works of weighted MinHash algorithms. In this review, we mainly categorize the Weighted MinHash algorithms into quantization-based approaches, active index-based ones and others, and show the evolution and inherent connection of the weighted MinHash algorithms, from the integer weighted MinHash algorithms to real-valued weighted MinHash ones (particularly the Consistent Weighted Sampling scheme). Also, we have developed a python toolbox for the algorithms, and released it in our github.

For example, dense deep neural network embedding vectors are often used in conjunction with sparse textual features to provide high dimensional hybrid representation of documents. Efficient search in such hybrid spaces is very challenging as the techniques that perform well for sparse vectors have little overlap with those that work well for dense vectors. Popular techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its data-dependent variants also do not give good accuracy in high dimensional hybrid spaces. Even though hybrid scenarios are becoming more prevalent, currently there exist no efficient techniques in literature that are both fast and accurate. In this paper, we propose a technique that approximates the inner product computation in hybrid vectors, leading to substantial speedup in search while maintaining high accuracy. We also propose efficient data structures that exploit modern computer architectures, resulting in orders of magnitude faster search than the existing baselines.

Link prediction, as one of the key problems for network-structured data, aims to predict whether there exists a link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space. However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner, but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm, while running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms.

By working with a 3.8M sketch dataset, we show that state-of-the-art hashing models specifically engineered for static images fail to perform well on temporal sketch data.

When the interaction history or the content feature is unavailable (the cold-start problem), their performance will be seriously deteriorated. 2) Existing methods learn the hash codes with relaxed optimization or adopt discrete coordinate descent to directly solve binary hash codes, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. In this paper, we propose a fast cold-start recommendation method, called Multi-Feature Discrete Collaborative Filtering (MFDCF), to solve these problems.

The metric loss penalizes the inter-class distances to push different classes unconstrained far away. Worse still, it tends to map the latent code deviate from ideal binarization point and generate severe ambiguity in the binarization process. Based on the minimum distance of the binary linear code, we creatively propose Hashing-guided Hinge Function (HHF) to avoid such conflict. In detail, the carefully-designed inflection point, which relies on the hash bit length and category numbers, is explicitly adopted to balance the metric term and quantization term.

Previous work on on-device transformers dynamically generate token embeddings on-the-fly without embedding matrices using locality-sensitive hashing over morphological information. These embeddings are subsequently fed into transformer layers for text classification. However, these methods are not pre-trained. Inspired by this line of work, we propose HashFormers, a new family of vocabulary-independent pre-trained transformers that support an unlimited vocabulary (i.e. all possible tokens in a corpus) given a substantially smaller fixed-sized embedding matrix. We achieve this by first introducing computationally cheap hashing functions that bucket together individual tokens to embeddings. We also propose three variants that do not require an embedding matrix at all, further reducing the memory requirements. We empirically demonstrate that HashFormers are more memory efficient compared to standard pre-trained transformers while achieving comparable predictive performance when fine-tuned on multiple text classification tasks.

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples.

This paper presents a deep compact code learning solution for efficient cross-modal similarity search. Many recent studies have proven that quantization-based approaches perform generally better than hashing-based approaches on single-modal similarity search. In this paper, we propose a deep quantization approach, which is among the early attempts of leveraging deep neural networks into quantization-based cross-modal similarity search. Our approach, dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), explicitly formulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private subspaces for individual modalities, and representations in the shared subspace and the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embedding of different modality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition, in the shared subspace, a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact codes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network architecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training, SPDQ can preserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly reduce quantization error.

In this paper, we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last, the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation.

Therefore, they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a real federated environment. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for each class. Globally, the transmission of global prototypes with only one prototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost and privacy risk.

To solve this limitation, we propose a novel method termed Nonlinear Robust Discrete Hashing (NRDH), for cross-modal retrieval. The main idea behind NRDH is motivated by the success of neural networks, i.e., nonlinear descriptors, in the field of representation learning, and the use of nonlinear descriptors instead of simple linear transformations is more in line with the complex relationships that exist between common latent representation and heterogeneous multimedia data in the real world. In NRDH, we first learn a common latent representation through nonlinear descriptors to encode complementary and consistent information from the features of the heterogeneous multimedia data. Moreover, an asymmetric learning scheme is proposed to correlate the learned hash codes with the common latent representation. Empirically, we demonstrate that NRDH is able to successfully generate a comprehensive common latent representation that significantly improves the quality of the learned hash codes. Then, NRDH adopts a linear learning strategy to fast learn the hash function with the learned hash codes.

In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model’s inference in 3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D’s versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 to 4 times.

In this paper, to address above issues, we propose a supervised cross-modal hashing method based on matrix factorization dubbed Efficient Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically, collective matrix factorization on heterogenous features and semantic embedding with class labels are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore, the feature based similarities and semantic correlations can be both preserved in hash codes, which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative.

However, it is still challenging to produce compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple semantics for two main reasons, 1) similarity constraints designed in most of the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity assignment(i.e., 0 for instance pairs sharing no label, 1 for instance pairs sharing at least 1 label), 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for the semantics of the given dataset, which efficiently and precisely guides a feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries, a new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity searching and robust hash code generation.

This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples’ hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally, we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning, which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner.

Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However, current UCMH methods calculate the similarity between two data, mainly relying on the two data’s cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space, because the cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the complex data relationships, such as situations where two data have different feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper, we devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN). Specifically, DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors. DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three types of data similarities (i.e., the graph-neighbor coherence, the coexistent similarity, and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization errors during hashing. Essentially, DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity problem by exploring and exploiting the data’s intrinsic relationships in a graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets.

For each local feature in the query image, we find its approximate nearest neighbors in the reference set. Next, we cluster the features from reference images using Dominant Set clustering, which affords several advantages over existing approaches. First, it permits variable number of nodes in the cluster which we use to dynamically select the number of nearest neighbors (typically coming from multiple reference images) for each query feature based on its discrimination value.

Pixel-layer features are obtained by encoding over the dictionary, followed by spatial pooling to obtain patch-layer features. The learned features are then seamlessly embedded into a multi-layer match- ing framework. We experimentally demonstrate that the learned features, together with our matching model, outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the SIFT flow, coherency sensitive hashing and the recent deformable spatial pyramid matching methods both in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a few different dictionary learning and feature encoding methods in the proposed pixel correspondences estimation framework, and analyse the impact of dictionary learning and feature encoding with respect to the final matching performance.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Unsupervised"] },

Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently. However, existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one hand, a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to the discrete Hamming distance, which raises a critical issue of image retrieval where fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand, different hash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently, and treating them equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the above two problems, we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH) approach, which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by weighted Hamming distance. First, a novel deep hashing network is proposed to learn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly, so that the learned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different image classes. Second, a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed, which rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing its semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image retrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance, which can provide more accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance.

However, the significant intra-class variations like pose, illumination, and expressions in face images, still pose a challenge for face image retrieval. In light of this, face image retrieval requires sufficiently powerful learning metrics, which are absent in current deep quantization works. Moreover, to tackle the growing unseen identities in the query stage, face image retrieval drives more demands regarding model generalization and system scalability than general image retrieval tasks. This paper integrates product quantization with orthonormal constraints into an end-to-end deep learning framework to effectively retrieve face images. Specifically, a novel scheme that uses predefined orthonormal vectors as codewords is proposed to enhance the quantization informativeness and reduce codewords’ redundancy. A tailored loss function maximizes discriminability among identities in each quantization subspace for both the quantized and original features. An entropy-based regularization term is imposed to reduce the quantization error. Experiments are conducted on four commonly-used face datasets under both seen and unseen identities retrieval settings. Our method outperforms all the compared deep hashing/quantization state-of-the-arts under both settings.

To address these issues, this work introduces a novel deep hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR. Specifically, we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings, which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then, we feed the case embeddings into fully-connected layers, and subsequently a hash layer generates hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss during relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR, we further propose an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function.

Meanwhile, the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods, neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e., images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits.

Meanwhile, a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure.

In the light of recent progress, convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning. However, complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by similar/dissimilar labels, which limits the retrieval performance. Generally, pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard, we propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code. Specifically, a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian distribution is proposed, which preserves semantic variations while penalizes the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes, a two-step optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance.

Basically, complementary features are coupled into a multi-dimensional inverted index. Each dimension of c-MI corresponds to one kind of feature, and the retrieval process votes for images similar in both SIFT and other feature spaces.

First, a submodular function is designed to measure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it, canonical views, which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited redundancy, are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy. Second, multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from multiple modalities into an intermediate representation.

The algorithm blends Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and vector quantization by mapping color information to a lower dimensional space, identifying distinct color regions, and classifying pixels together based on both a proximity measure and color content. It is observed that these techniques permit a significant reduction in color resolution while maintaining the visually important features of images.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV","Quantisation","Unsupervised"] },

Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then, pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data. Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that, the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the competing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval","Quantisation","Supervised"] },
{"key": "ñanculef2020self", "year": "2020", "title":"Self-supervised Bernoulli Autoencoders For Semi-supervised Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Semantic hashing is an emerging technique for large-scale similarity search based on representing high-dimensional data using similarity-preserving binary codes used for efficient indexing and search. It has recently been shown that variational autoencoders, with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by neural nets, can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and unsupervised scenarios, improving on more traditional methods thanks to their ability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However, the scenario where labels are scarce has not been studied yet. This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on variational autoencoders to the lack of supervision, focusing on two semi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational autoencoder’s training objective to jointly model the distribution over the data and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to define an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the similarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space. Our experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash codes’ quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number of labelled points is large. However, we found that this method degrades quickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent this problem, we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its label distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to the best baseline, this procedure yields similar performance in fully supervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data is scarce.
