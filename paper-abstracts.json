However, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes, which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed, most of them are time-consuming. In addition, most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization, making them unscalable. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method—Scalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing, SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition, it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm, it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover, the binary codes can be generated discretely, reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely, Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, and NUS-WIDE, have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>\n", "tags": ["Hashing Methods","Multimodal Retrieval"] },

In PerVL, one should learn personalized\nconcepts (1) independently of the downstream task (2) allowing a pretrained\nmodel to reason about them with free language, and (3) does not require\npersonalized negative examples. We propose an architecture for solving PerVL\nthat operates by extending the input vocabulary of a pretrained model with new\nword embeddings for the new personalized concepts. The model can then reason\nabout them by simply using them in a sentence. We demonstrate that our approach\nlearns personalized visual concepts from a few examples and can effectively\napply them in image retrieval and semantic segmentation using rich textual\nqueries.</p>\n", "tags": [] },

To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stream ConvNet architecture, which learns hash codes with class-specific representation centers.

To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-embedding retrieval framework designed to enhance user interest representation by generating multiple user embeddings conditioned on both implicit and explicit user interests.

Some early graph-based approaches have shown attractive theoretical guarantees on search time complexity, but they all suffer from the problem of high indexing time complexity. Recently, some graph-based methods have been proposed to reduce indexing complexity by approximating the traditional graphs; these methods have achieved revolutionary performance on million-scale datasets. Yet, they still can not scale to billion-node databases. In this paper, to further improve the search-efficiency and scalability of graph-based methods, we start by introducing four aspects: (1) ensuring the connectivity of the graph; (2) lowering the average out-degree of the graph for fast traversal; (3) shortening the search path; and (4) reducing the index size. Then, we propose a novel graph structure called Monotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (MRNG) which guarantees very low search complexity (close to logarithmic time). To further lower the indexing complexity and make it practical for billion-node ANNS problems, we propose a novel graph structure named Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) by approximating the MRNG. The NSG takes the four aspects into account simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that NSG outperforms all the existing algorithms significantly.

The server then runs neural inference on the encrypted data and returns the encrypted results. The client decrypts the output locally, keeping both the input and result private from the server. Private inference has focused on networks with dense inputs such as image classification, and less attention has been given to networks with sparse features. Unlike dense inputs, sparse features require efficient encrypted lookup operations into large embedding tables, which present computational and memory constraints for FHE.\n  In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities when applying FHE to Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) from both a compiler and systems perspective.

Unfortunately,\nall known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality;\nin fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search.

In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart.

In\naddition, we present a network for retrieving the shop images in this scenario,\ndubbed SEAM Match-RCNN. The model is trained by image-to-video domain\nadaptation, allowing to use video sequences where only their association with a\nshop image is given, eliminating the need of millions of annotated bounding\nboxes. SEAM Match-RCNN builds an embedding, where an attention-based weighted\nsum of few frames (10) of a social video is enough to individuate the correct\nproduct within the first 5 retrieved items in a 14K+ shop element gallery with\nan accuracy of 80%.

A common\napproach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \\textit{hash\ncodes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search\nthrough direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in\nan appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared\nto real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash\ncodes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small\nnumber of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way\nthat does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use\nrepresentation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural\nautoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by\nlearning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis\naddresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to\nrepresentation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through\nmore expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than\nthe current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve\nefficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited\nto the choice of search method.

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient.

The effective\nuse of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing\n(real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper, we focus on a simple\n2-bit coding scheme. In particular, we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of\ndata similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important\npractical applications. For example, in the task of near neighbor search, a\ncrucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data\nsimilarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash\ntable techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed\ncoding scheme and estimator.\n  As a related task, in this paper, we also study a simple uniform quantization\nscheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our\nanalysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For\nexample, when the target similarity level is high, 2 or 3 bits might be\nsufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high, it is preferable\nto use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore, a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good\nchoice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash\ntables.\n  Combining these results, we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be\nrecommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation.\nExtensive experimental results are provided.</p>\n", "tags": ["Locality Sensitive Hashing"] },

In this paper, we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash coding and propose Deep Joint Semantics Reconstructing Hashing (DJSRH), which has the following two main advantages. First, to learn binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure of the original data, DJSRH constructs a novel joint-semantics affinity matrix which elaborately integrates the original neighborhood information from different modalities and accordingly is capable to capture the latent intrinsic semantic affinity for the input multi-modal instances. Second, DJSRH later trains the networks to generate binary codes that maximally reconstruct above joint-semantics relations via the proposed reconstructing framework, which is more competent for the batch-wise training as it reconstructs the specific similarity value unlike the common Laplacian constraint merely preserving the similarity order.

We first\ndefine the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms\nof kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which\nconsists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising\nphase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features\nwithin it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the\nlocally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the\nskeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the\nsequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a\nhashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a\nhigh efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and\nFlorence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation\nefficiency.</p>\n", "tags": ["Hashing Methods","Neural Hashing","Efficiency","Supervised"] },

Most of existing studies take a similarity matrix as supervision to optimize their models, and the inner product between continuous surrogates of hash codes is utilized to depict the similarity in the Hamming space. However, all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix, ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one, i.e., the categories that samples do not belong to. Therefore, they cannot effectively alleviate the effect of dissimilar samples. Moreover, due to the modality distribution difference, directly utilizing continuous surrogates of hash codes to calculate similarity may induce suboptimal retrieval performance. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep normalized cross-modal hashing scheme with bi-direction relation reasoning, named Bi_NCMH. Specifically, we build the multi-level semantic similarity matrix by considering bi-direction relation, i.e., consistent and inconsistent relation. It hence can holistically characterize relations among instances. Besides, we execute feature normalization on continuous surrogates of hash codes to eliminate the deviation caused by modality gap, which further reduces the negative impact of binarization on retrieval performance.

In this paper, we address the semi-supervised quantization problem by considering: (i) pairwise similarity information (without class label information) across different domains, which captures the intra-document relation, (ii) cross-domain data with class label which can help capture inter-document relation, and (iii) cross-domain data with neither pairwise similarity nor class label which enables the full use of abundant unlabelled information.

For such, we propose a novel multimodal\napproach based solely on convolutional neural networks for aligning images with\ntheir captions by directly convolving raw characters. Our proposed\ncharacter-based textual embeddings allow the replacement of both\nword-embeddings and recurrent neural networks for text understanding, saving\nprocessing time and requiring fewer learnable parameters. Our method is based\non the idea of projecting both visual and textual information into a common\nembedding space. For training such embeddings we optimize a contrastive loss\nfunction that is computed to minimize order-violations between images and their\nrespective descriptions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in the largest\nand most well-known image-text alignment dataset, namely Microsoft COCO, with a\nmethod that is conceptually much simpler and that possesses considerably fewer\nparameters than current approaches.</p>\n", "tags": [] },

A typical image-to-image search\nengine only handles one-to-one relationships, colloquially, one image\ncorresponds to another single image. But image-to-video proliferates. Take a\n24-min length video as an example, it will generate roughly 20,000 image\nframes. As the number of videos grows, the scale of the dataset explodes\nexponentially. In this case, a compute-efficient approach ought to be\nconsidered, and the system design should cater to the cloud-native trend.\nChoosing an emerging technology - vector database as its backbone, Shotit fits\nthese two metrics performantly. Experiments for two different datasets, a 50\nthousand-scale Blender Open Movie dataset, and a 50 million-scale proprietary\nTV genre dataset at a 4 Core 32GB RAM Intel Xeon Gold 6271C cloud machine with\nobject storage reveal the effectiveness of Shotit.

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples.

Our\napproach, dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), explicitly\nformulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private\nsubspaces for individual modalities, and representations in the shared subspace\nand the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embedding of different\nmodality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition, in the shared\nsubspace, a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact\ncodes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network\narchitecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training, SPDQ can\npreserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly\nreduce quantization error. Experiments on two popular benchmarks corroborate\nthat our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Quantization"] },

To further address this problem, we propose an adversarial\nhashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content\nsimilarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi-modal data.\nThe proposed new adversarial network, HashGAN, consists of three building\nblocks: 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations, 2)\nthe generative attention module to generate an attention mask, which is used to\nobtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature\nrepresentations, 3) the discriminative hash coding module to learn hash\nfunctions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our\nframework, the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in\nan adversarial way: the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot\npreserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the background feature\nrepresentations, while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of\nmulti-modal data w.r.t. both the foreground and the background feature\nrepresentations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over\nother state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Hashing Methods","Robustness"] },

Considering these issues, we propose a center-based framework integrating end-to-end hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. The framework minimizes the intra-class variance by clustering intra-class samples into a learnable class center. To strengthen inter-class separability, it additionally imposes a novel regularization term to enlarge the Hamming distance between pairwise class centers. Moreover, a simple yet effective regression matrix is introduced to encourage intra-class samples to generate the same binary codes, which further enhances the hashing codes compactness.

Many hashing approaches have been proposed for the cross-media search task. However, there are still open problems that warrant investigation. For example, most existing supervised hashing approaches employ a binary label matrix, which achieves small margins between wrong labels (0) and true labels (1). This may affect the retrieval performance by generating many false negatives and false positives. In addition, some methods adopt a relaxation scheme to solve the binary constraints, which may cause large quantization errors. There are also some discrete hashing methods that have been presented, but most of them are time-consuming. To conquer these problems, we present a label relaxation and discrete matrix factorization method (LRMF) for cross-modal retrieval. It offers a number of innovations. First of all, the proposed approach employs a novel label relaxation scheme to control the margins adaptively, which has the benefit of reducing the quantization error. Second, by virtue of the proposed discrete matrix factorization method designed to learn the binary codes, large quantization errors caused by relaxation can be avoided.

Despite the great success achieved, unsupervised cross-modal hashing still suffers from lacking reliable similarity supervision and struggles with handling the heterogeneity issue between different modalities. To cope with these, in this paper, we devise a new deep hashing model, termed as High-order Nonlocal Hashing (HNH) to facilitate cross-modal retrieval with the following advantages. First, different from existing methods that mainly leverage low-level local-view similarity as the guidance for hashing learning, we propose a high-order affinity measure that considers the multi-modal neighbourhood structures from a nonlocal perspective, thereby comprehensively capturing the similarity relationships between data items. Second, a common representation is introduced to correlate different modalities. By enforcing the modal-specific descriptors and the common representation to be aligned with each other, the proposed HNH significantly bridges the modality gap and maintains the intra-consistency.

Recently, the\nprinciple has also been used to learn cross-modal embeddings for video and\ntext, yet without exploiting its full potential. In particular, previous losses\ndo not take the intra-modality similarities into account, which leads to\ninefficient embeddings, as the same content is mapped to multiple points in the\nembedding space. With CrossCLR, we present a contrastive loss that fixes this\nissue. Moreover, we define sets of highly related samples in terms of their\ninput embeddings and exclude them from the negative samples to avoid issues\nwith false negatives. We show that these principles consistently improve the\nquality of the learned embeddings. The joint embeddings learned with CrossCLR\nextend the state of the art in video-text retrieval on Youcook2 and LSMDC\ndatasets and in video captioning on Youcook2 dataset by a large margin.

We build on the recently proposed\nboundary tree algorithm which allows for efficient nearest neighbor\nclassification, regression and retrieval. By modelling traversals in the tree\nas stochastic events, we are able to form a differentiable cost function which\nis associated with the tree’s predictions. Using a deep neural network to\ntransform the data and back-propagating through the tree allows us to learn\ngood representations for kNN methods.\n  We demonstrate that our method is able to learn suitable representations\nallowing for very efficient trees with a clearly interpretable structure.</p>\n", "tags": [] },

Given semantic annotations such as class labels\nand pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and\ngenerate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images\nmay contain undefined semantic labels, which we call unseen images, zeor-shot\nhashing techniques have been studied. However, existing zeor-shot hashing\nmethods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle\nmulti-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive\nzero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In\norder to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge\nis built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then,\npairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for\ntraining a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data.\nExtensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that,\nthe proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the\ncompeting methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Hashing Methods","Image Retrieval","Few Shot & Zero Shot"] },

However, contemporary methods exhibit significant\nlimitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information\nredundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an\ninnovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning\nfor adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for\naffinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental\ntechnical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that\npreserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii)\nan adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space\nModel with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and\n(iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity\nthrough hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this\nstudy presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within\ncollaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for\nenhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive\nevaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates\nsubstantial performance improvements over existing approaches.

It has recently been shown that\nvariational autoencoders, with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by\nneural nets, can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and\nunsupervised scenarios, improving on more traditional methods thanks to their\nability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However, the scenario\nwhere labels are scarce has not been studied yet.\n  This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on\nvariational autoencoders to the lack of supervision, focusing on two\nsemi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational\nautoencoder’s training objective to jointly model the distribution over the\ndata and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to\ndefine an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the\nsimilarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space.\nOur experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash\ncodes’ quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number\nof labelled points is large. However, we found that this method degrades\nquickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent\nthis problem, we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its\nlabel distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to\nthe best baseline, this procedure yields similar performance in fully\nsupervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data\nis scarce.
