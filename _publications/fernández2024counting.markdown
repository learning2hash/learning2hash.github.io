Extending the classical Dirichlet's density theorem on coprime pairs, in this
paper we describe completely the probability distribution of the number of
coprime pairs in random squares of fixed side length in the lattice
\(\mathbb\{N\}^2\). The limit behaviour of this distribution as the side length of
the random square tends to infinity is also considered.
