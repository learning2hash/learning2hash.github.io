Recent advances in the machine learning community allowed different use cases
to emerge, as its association to domains like cooking which created the
computational cuisine. In this paper, we tackle the picture-recipe alignment
problem, having as target application the large-scale retrieval task (finding a
recipe given a picture, and vice versa). Our approach is validated on the
Recipe1M dataset, composed of one million image-recipe pairs and additional
class information, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results.
