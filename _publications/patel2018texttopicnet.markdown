The immense success of deep learning based methods in computer vision heavily
relies on large scale training datasets. These richly annotated datasets help
the network learn discriminative visual features. Collecting and annotating
such datasets requires a tremendous amount of human effort and annotations are
limited to popular set of classes. As an alternative, learning visual features
by designing auxiliary tasks which make use of freely available
self-supervision has become increasingly popular in the computer vision
community.
  In this paper, we put forward an idea to take advantage of multi-modal
context to provide self-supervision for the training of computer vision
algorithms. We show that adequate visual features can be learned efficiently by
training a CNN to predict the semantic textual context in which a particular
image is more probable to appear as an illustration. More specifically we use
popular text embedding techniques to provide the self-supervision for the
training of deep CNN.
  Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in image
classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval compared to recent
self-supervised or naturally-supervised approaches.
