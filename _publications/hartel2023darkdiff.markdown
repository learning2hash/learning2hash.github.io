In large-scale data analysis, near-duplicates are often a problem. For
example, with two near-duplicate phishing emails, a difference in the
salutation (Mr versus Ms) is not essential, but whether it is bank A or B is
important. The state-of-the-art in near-duplicate detection is a black box
approach (MinHash), so one only knows that emails are near-duplicates, but not
why. We present DarkDiff, which can efficiently detect near-duplicates while
providing the reason why there is a near-duplicate. We have developed DarkDiff
to detect near-duplicates of homepages on the Darkweb. DarkDiff works well on
those pages because they resemble the clear web of the past.
