This article discuss the problem of color image content comparison.
Particularly, methods of image content comparison are analyzed, restrictions of
color histogram are described and a modified method of images content
comparison is proposed. This method uses the color histograms and considers
color locations. Testing and analyzing of based and modified algorithms are
performed. The modified method shows 97% average precision for a collection
containing about 700 images without loss of the advantages of based method,
i.e. scale and rotation invariant.
