Gatys et al. (2015) showed that pair-wise products of features in a
convolutional network are a very effective representation of image textures. We
propose a simple modification to that representation which makes it possible to
incorporate long-range structure into image generation, and to render images
that satisfy various symmetry constraints. We show how this can greatly improve
rendering of regular textures and of images that contain other kinds of
symmetric structure. We also present applications to inpainting and season
transfer.
