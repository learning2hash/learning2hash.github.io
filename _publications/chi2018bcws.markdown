This paper introduces the first dataset for evaluating English-Chinese
Bilingual Contextual Word Similarity, namely BCWS
(https://github.com/MiuLab/BCWS). The dataset consists of 2,091 English-Chinese
word pairs with the corresponding sentential contexts and their similarity
scores annotated by the human. Our annotated dataset has higher consistency
compared to other similar datasets. We establish several baselines for the
bilingual embedding task to benchmark the experiments. Modeling cross-lingual
sense representations as provided in this dataset has the potential of moving
artificial intelligence from monolingual understanding towards multilingual
understanding.
