We propose a new method to embed data in binary images, including scanned text, figures, and signatures. Our method relies on the concept of wet paper codes. The shuffling before embedding is used in order to equalize irregular embedding capacity from diverse areas in the image. The hidden data can be extracted without the original binary image. We illustrate some examples of watermarked binary images after wet paper coding.
