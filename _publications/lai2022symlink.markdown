Mathematical symbols and descriptions appear in various forms across document
section boundaries without explicit markup. In this paper, we present a new
large-scale dataset that emphasizes extracting symbols and descriptions in
scientific documents. Symlink annotates scientific papers of 5 different
domains (i.e., computer science, biology, physics, mathematics, and economics).
Our experiments on Symlink demonstrate the challenges of the symbol-description
linking task for existing models and call for further research effort in this
area. We will publicly release Symlink to facilitate future research.
