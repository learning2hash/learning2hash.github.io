We propose a novel, efficient, modular and scalable framework for content
based visual media retrieval systems by leveraging the power of Deep Learning
which is flexible to work both for images and videos conjointly and we also
introduce an efficient comparison and filtering metric for retrieval. We put
forward our findings from critical performance tests comparing our method to
the predominant conventional approach to demonstrate the feasibility and
efficiency of the proposed solution with best practices, possible improvements
that may further augment the ability of retrieval architectures.
