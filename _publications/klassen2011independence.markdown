A tabulation45;based hash function maps a key into d derived characters indexing random values in tables that are then combined with bitwise xor operations to give the hash. Thorup and Zhang (2004) presented d45;wise independent tabulation45;based hash classes that use linear maps over finite fields to map a key considered as a vector (ab) to derived characters. We show that a variant where the derived characters are a+bi for i=0... q45;1 (using integer arithmetic) yielding (2d45;1)45;wise independence. Our analysis is based on an algebraic property that characterizes k45;wise independence of tabulation45;based hashing schemes and combines this characterization with a geometric argument. We also prove a non45;trivial lower bound on the number of derived characters necessary for k45;wise independence with our and related hash classes.
