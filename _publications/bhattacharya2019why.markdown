Visual question answering is the task of returning the answer to a question
about an image. A challenge is that different people often provide different
answers to the same visual question. To our knowledge, this is the first work
that aims to understand why. We propose a taxonomy of nine plausible reasons,
and create two labelled datasets consisting of ~45,000 visual questions
indicating which reasons led to answer differences. We then propose a novel
problem of predicting directly from a visual question which reasons will cause
answer differences as well as a novel algorithm for this purpose. Experiments
demonstrate the advantage of our approach over several related baselines on two
diverse datasets. We publicly share the datasets and code at
