We present preliminary results in quantitative analyses of color usage in
selected authors' works from LitBank. Using Glasgow Norms, human ratings on
5000+ words, we measure attributes of nouns dependent on color terms. Early
results demonstrate a significant increase in noun concreteness over time. We
also propose future research directions for computational literary color
analytics.
