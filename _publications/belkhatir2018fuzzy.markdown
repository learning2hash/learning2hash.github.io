Due to the difficulty of automatically mapping visual features with semantic
descriptors, state-of-the-art frameworks have exhibited poor performance in
terms of coverage and effectiveness for indexing the visual content. This
prompted us to investigate the use of both the Web as a large information
source from where to extract relevant contextual linguistic information and
bimodal visual-textual indexing as a technique to enrich the vocabulary of
index concepts. Our proposal is based on the Signal/Semantic approach for
multimedia indexing which generates multi-facetted conceptual representations
of the visual content. We propose to enrich these image representations with
concepts automatically extracted from the visual contextual information. We
specifically target the integration of semantic concepts which are more
specific than the initial index concepts since they represent the visual
content with greater accuracy and precision. Also, we aim to correct the faulty
indexes resulting from the automatic semantic tagging. Experimentally, the
details of the prototyping are given and the presented technique is tested in a
Web-scale evaluation on 30 queries representing elaborate image scenes.
