We present a new killing-a-fly-with-a-sledgehammer proof of one of the oldest
results in probability which says that the probability that a random
permutation on \(n\) elements has no fixed points tends to \(e^\{-1\}\) as \(n\) tends
to infinity. Our proof stems from the connection between permutations and
polynomials over finite fields and is based on an independence argument, which
is trivial in the polynomial world.
