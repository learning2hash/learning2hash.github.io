The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture,
biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data,
we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of
pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages
data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive,
consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets.
ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for
chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and
identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve
as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can
support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to
bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking
molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating
advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a
valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee
conservation.
