We obtain essentially matching upper and lower bounds for the expected
max-sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure on a separable
Hilbert space and its empirical distribution from \\(n\\) samples. By proving a
Banach space version of this result, we also obtain an upper bound, that is
sharp up to a log factor, for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance
between a symmetric probability measure \\(\mu\\) on a Euclidean space and its
symmetrized empirical distribution in terms of the operator norm of the
covariance matrix of \\(\mu\\) and the diameter of the support of \\(\mu\\).
