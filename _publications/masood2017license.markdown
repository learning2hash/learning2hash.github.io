This work details Sighthounds fully automated license plate detection and
recognition system. The core technology of the system is built using a sequence
of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) interlaced with accurate and
efficient algorithms. The CNNs are trained and fine-tuned so that they are
robust under different conditions (e.g. variations in pose, lighting,
occlusion, etc.) and can work across a variety of license plate templates (e.g.
sizes, backgrounds, fonts, etc). For quantitative analysis, we show that our
system outperforms the leading license plate detection and recognition
technology i.e. ALPR on several benchmarks. Our system is available to
developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at
