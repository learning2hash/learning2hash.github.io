It is shown that there does not exist a binary projective triply-even code of
length \\(59\\). This settles the last open length for projective triply-even
binary codes. Therefore, projective triply-even binary codes exist precisely
for lengths \\(15\\), \\(16\\), \\(30\\), \\(31\\), \\(32\\), \\(45\\)--\\(51\\), and \\(\ge 60\\).
