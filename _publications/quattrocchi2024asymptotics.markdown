We investigate the minimal error in approximating a general probability
measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) by the uniform measure on a finite set with
prescribed cardinality \(n\). The error is measured in the \(p\)-Wasserstein
distance. In particular, when \(1\le p<d\), we establish asymptotic upper and
lower bounds as \(n \to \infty\) on the rescaled minimal error that have the
same, explicit dependency on \(\mu\).
  In some instances, we prove that the rescaled minimal error has a limit.
These include general measures in dimension \(d = 2\) with \(1 \le p < 2\), and
uniform measures in arbitrary dimension with \(1 \le p < d\). For some uniform
measures, we prove the limit existence for \(p \ge d\) as well.
  For a class of compactly supported measures with H\"older densities, we
determine the convergence speed of the minimal error for every \(p \ge 1\).
  Furthermore, we establish a new Pierce-type (i.e., nonasymptotic) upper
estimate of the minimal error when \(1 \le p < d\).
  In the initial sections, we survey the state of the art and draw connections
with similar problems, such as classical and random quantization.
