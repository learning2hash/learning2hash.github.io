In this work, we propose a fast superpixel-based color transfer method (SCT)
between two images. Superpixels enable to decrease the image dimension and to
extract a reduced set of color candidates. We propose to use a fast approximate
nearest neighbor matching algorithm in which we enforce the match diversity by
limiting the selection of the same superpixels. A fusion framework is designed
to transfer the matched colors, and we demonstrate the improvement obtained
over exact matching results. Finally, we show that SCT is visually competitive
compared to state-of-the-art methods.
