We present collaborative similarity embedding (CSE), a unified framework that
exploits comprehensive collaborative relations available in a user-item
bipartite graph for representation learning and recommendation. In the proposed
framework, we differentiate two types of proximity relations: direct proximity
and k-th order neighborhood proximity. While learning from the former exploits
direct user-item associations observable from the graph, learning from the
latter makes use of implicit associations such as user-user similarities and
item-item similarities, which can provide valuable information especially when
the graph is sparse. Moreover, for improving scalability and flexibility, we
propose a sampling technique that is specifically designed to capture the two
types of proximity relations. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets
show that CSE yields significantly better performance than state-of-the-art
recommendation methods.
