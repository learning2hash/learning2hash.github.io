In this paper we are going to introduce a new nearest neighbours based
approach to clustering, and compare it with previous solutions; the resulting
algorithm, which takes inspiration from both DBscan and minimum spanning tree
approaches, is deterministic but proves simpler, faster and doesnt require to
set in advance a value for k, the number of clusters.
