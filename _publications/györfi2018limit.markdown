Let \(X_1, \ldots, X_n\) be independent random points drawn from an absolutely
continuous probability measure with density \(f\) in \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\). Under mild
conditions on \(f\), we derive a Poisson limit theorem for the number of large
probability nearest neighbor balls. Denoting by \(P_n\) the maximum probability
measure of nearest neighbor balls, this limit theorem implies a Gumbel extreme
value distribution for \(nP_n - \ln n\) as \(n \to \infty\). Moreover, we derive a
tight upper bound on the upper tail of the distribution of \(nP_n - \ln n\),
which does not depend on \(f\).
