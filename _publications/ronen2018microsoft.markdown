The Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge was announced in 2015 along
with a publication of a huge dataset of nearly 0.5 terabytes, consisting of
disassembly and bytecode of more than 20K malware samples. Apart from serving
in the Kaggle competition, the dataset has become a standard benchmark for
research on modeling malware behaviour. To date, the dataset has been cited in
more than 50 research papers. Here we provide a high-level comparison of the
publications citing the dataset. The comparison simplifies finding potential
research directions in this field and future performance evaluation of the
dataset.
