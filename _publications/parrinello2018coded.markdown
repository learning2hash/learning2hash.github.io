The work identifies the fundamental limits of coded caching when the K
receiving users share \{\Lambda\}\(\leq\) K helper-caches, each assisting an
arbitrary number of different users. The main result is the derivation of the
exact optimal worst-case delivery time - under the assumption of uncoded cache
placement - for any user-to-cache association profile, where each such profile
describes how many users are helped by each cache. This is achieved with a new
information-theoretic converse that is based on index coding and which proves
that a simple XOR-shrinking-and-removal coded-caching scheme is optimal
irrespective of the user-to-cache association profile. All the results also
apply directly to the coded caching problem with multiple file requests.
