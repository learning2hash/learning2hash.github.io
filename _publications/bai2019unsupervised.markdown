We introduce a novel approach to graph-level representation learning, which
is to embed an entire graph into a vector space where the embeddings of two
graphs preserve their graph-graph proximity. Our approach, UGRAPHEMB, is a
general framework that provides a novel means to performing graph-level
embedding in a completely unsupervised and inductive manner. The learned neural
network can be considered as a function that receives any graph as input,
either seen or unseen in the training set, and transforms it into an embedding.
A novel graph-level embedding generation mechanism called Multi-Scale Node
Attention (MSNA), is proposed. Experiments on five real graph datasets show
that UGRAPHEMB achieves competitive accuracy in the tasks of graph
classification, similarity ranking, and graph visualization.
