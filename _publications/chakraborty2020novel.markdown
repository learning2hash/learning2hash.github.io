Steganography methods in general terms tend to embed more and more secret
bits in the cover images. Most of these methods are designed to embed secret
information in such a way that the change in the visual quality of the
resulting stego image is not detectable. There exists some methods which
preserve the global structure of the cover after embedding. However, the
embedding capacity of these methods is very less. In this paper a novel feature
based blind image steganography technique is proposed, which preserves the LBP
(Local binary pattern) feature of the cover with comparable embedding rates.
Local binary pattern is a well known image descriptor used for image
representation. The proposed scheme computes the local binary pattern to hide
the bits of the secret image in such a way that the local relationship that
exists in the cover are preserved in the resulting stego image. The performance
of the proposed steganography method has been tested on several images of
different types to show the robustness. State of the art LSB based
steganography methods are compared with the proposed method to show the
effectiveness of feature based image steganography
