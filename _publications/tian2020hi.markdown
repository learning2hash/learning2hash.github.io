With the acceleration of the urban expansion, urban change detection (UCD),
as a significant and effective approach, can provide the change information
with respect to geospatial objects for dynamical urban analysis. However,
existing datasets suffer from three bottlenecks: (1) lack of high spatial
resolution images; (2) lack of semantic annotation; (3) lack of long-range
multi-temporal images. In this paper, we propose a large scale benchmark
dataset, termed Hi-UCD. This dataset uses aerial images with a spatial
resolution of 0.1 m provided by the Estonia Land Board, including three-time
phases, and semantically annotated with nine classes of land cover to obtain
the direction of ground objects change. It can be used for detecting and
analyzing refined urban changes. We benchmark our dataset using some classic
methods in binary and multi-class change detection. Experimental results show
that Hi-UCD is challenging yet useful. We hope the Hi-UCD can become a strong
benchmark accelerating future research.
