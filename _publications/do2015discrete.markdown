This paper addresses the problem of learning binary hash codes for large scale image search by proposing a novel hashing method based on deep neural network. The advantage of our deep model over previous deep model used in hashing is that our model contains necessary criteria for producing good codes such as similarity preserving balance and independence. Another advantage of our method is that instead of relaxing the binary constraint of codes during the learning process as most previous works in this paper by introducing the auxiliary variable we reformulate the optimization into two sub-optimization steps allowing us to efficiently solve binary constraints without any relaxation. The proposed method is also extended to the supervised hashing by leveraging the label information such that the learned binary codes preserve the pairwise label of inputs. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art hashing methods.
