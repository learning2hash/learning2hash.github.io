Let \\((M,g_1)\\) be a complete \\(d\\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold for \\(d > 1\\).
Let \\(\mathcal X_n\\) be a set of \\(n\\) sample points in \\(M\\) drawn randomly from a
smooth Lebesgue density \\(f\\) supported in \\(M\\). Let \\(x,y\\) be two points in \\(M\\).
We prove that the normalized length of the power-weighted shortest path between
\\(x, y\\) through \\(\mathcal X_n\\) converges almost surely to a constant multiple of
the Riemannian distance between \\(x,y\\) under the metric tensor \\(g_p =
f^\{2(1-p)/d\} g_1\\), where \\(p > 1\\) is the power parameter.
