We study the following problem: Given \(k\) paths that share the same vertex
set, is there a simultaneous geometric embedding of these paths such that each
individual drawing is monotone in some direction? We prove that for any
dimension \(d \geq 2\), there is a set of \(d+1\) paths that does not admit a
monotone simultaneous geometric embedding.
