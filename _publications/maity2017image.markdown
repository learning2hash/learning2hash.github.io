Tamper detection using image hash is a very common problem of modern days.
Several research and advancements have already been done to address this
problem. However, most of the existing methods lack the accuracy of tamper
detection when the tampered area is low, as well as requiring long image
hashes. In this paper, we propose a novel method objectively to minimize the
hash length while enhancing the performance at low tampered area.
