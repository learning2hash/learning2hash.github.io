Music genre classification is a critical component of music recommendation
systems, generation algorithms, and cultural analytics. In this work, we
present an innovative model for classifying music genres using attention-based
temporal signature modeling. By processing spectrogram sequences through
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and multi-head attention layers, our
approach captures the most temporally significant moments within each piece,
crafting a unique "signature" for genre identification. This temporal focus not
only enhances classification accuracy but also reveals insights into
genre-specific characteristics that can be intuitively mapped to listener
perceptions. Our findings offer potential applications in personalized music
recommendation systems by highlighting cross-genre similarities and
distinctiveness, aligning closely with human musical intuition. This work
bridges the gap between technical classification tasks and the nuanced, human
experience of genre.
