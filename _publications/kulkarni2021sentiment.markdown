Literary artefacts are generally indexed and searched based on titles, meta
data and keywords over the years. This searching and indexing works well when
user/reader already knows about that particular creative textual artefact or
document. This indexing and search hardly takes into account interest and
emotional makeup of readers and its mapping to books. When a person is looking
for a literary textual artefact, he/she might be looking for not only
information but also to seek the joy of reading. In case of literary artefacts,
progression of emotions across the key events could prove to be the key for
indexing and searching. In this paper, we establish clusters among literary
artefacts based on computational relationships among sentiment progressions
using intelligent text analysis. We have created a database of 1076 English
titles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html with 16559 titles and their
summaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching
and recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of
book titles of interest to readers. The analysis clearly suggests better
searching and indexing when we are targeting book lovers looking for a
particular type of book or creative artefact. This indexing and searching can
find many real-life applications for recommending books.
