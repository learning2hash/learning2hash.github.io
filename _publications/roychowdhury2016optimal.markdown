The purpose of quantization for a probability distribution is to estimate the
probability by a discrete probability with finite support. In this paper, a
nonuniform probability measure \(P\) on \(\mathbb R^2\) which has support the
Sierpi\'nski carpet generated by a set of four contractive similarity mappings
with equal similarity ratios has been considered. For this probability measure,
the optimal sets of \(n\)-means and the \(n\)th quantization errors are
investigated for all \(n\geq 2\).
