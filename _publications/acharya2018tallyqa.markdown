Most counting questions in visual question answering (VQA) datasets are
simple and require no more than object detection. Here, we study algorithms for
complex counting questions that involve relationships between objects,
attribute identification, reasoning, and more. To do this, we created TallyQA,
the world's largest dataset for open-ended counting. We propose a new algorithm
for counting that uses relation networks with region proposals. Our method lets
relation networks be efficiently used with high-resolution imagery. It yields
state-of-the-art results compared to baseline and recent systems on both
TallyQA and the HowMany-QA benchmark.
