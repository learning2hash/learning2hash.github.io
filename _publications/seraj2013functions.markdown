While exploring desirable properties of hash functions in cryptography, the author was led to investigate three notions of functions with scattering or diffusive properties, where the functions map between binary strings of fixed finite length. These notions of diffusion ask for some property to be fulfilled by the Hamming distances between outputs corresponding to pairs of inputs that lie on the endpoints of edges of an \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}n\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}-dimensional hypercube. Given the dimension of the input space, we explicitly construct such functions for every dimension of the output space that allows for the functions to exist.
