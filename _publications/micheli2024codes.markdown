Let \(q\) be a prime power. This paper provides a new class of linear codes
that arises from the action of the alternating group on \(\mathbb
F_q[x_1,\dots,x_m]\) combined with the ideas in (M. Datta and T. Johnsen, 2022).
Compared with Generalized Reed-Muller codes with similar parameters, our codes
have the same asymptotic relative distance but a better rate. Our results
follow from combinations of Galois theoretical methods with Weil-type bounds
for the number of points of hypersurfaces over finite fields.
