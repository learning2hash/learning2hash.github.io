Typical retrieval systems have three requirements: a) Accurate retrieval
i.e., the method should have high precision, b) Diverse retrieval, i.e., the
obtained set of points should be diverse, c) Retrieval time should be small.
However, most of the existing methods address only one or two of the above
mentioned requirements. In this work, we present a method based on randomized
locality sensitive hashing which tries to address all of the above requirements
simultaneously. While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate
retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency, we argue that one
can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs
between accuracy and diversity. We extend our method to the problem of
multi-label prediction, where the goal is to output a diverse and accurate set
of labels for a given document in real-time. Moreover, we introduce a new
notion to simultaneously evaluate a method's performance for both the precision
and diversity measures. Finally, we present empirical results on several
different retrieval tasks and show that our method retrieves diverse and
accurate images/labels while ensuring \\(100x\\)-speed-up over the existing diverse
retrieval approaches.
