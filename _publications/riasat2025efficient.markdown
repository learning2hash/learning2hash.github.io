We propose an efficient algorithm to find a Reed-Solomon (RS) codeword at a
distance within the covering radius of the code from any point in its ambient
Hamming space. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt
of its kind to solve the covering problem for RS codes. The proposed algorithm
leverages off-the-shelf decoding methods for RS codes, including the
Berlekamp-Welch algorithm for unique decoding and the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm
for list decoding. We also present theoretical and numerical results on the
capabilities of the proposed algorithm and, in particular, the average covering
radius resulting from it. Our numerical results suggest that the overlapping
Hamming spheres of radius close to the Guruswami-Sudan decoding radius centered
at the codewords cover most of the ambient Hamming space.
