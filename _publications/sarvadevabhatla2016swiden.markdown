Current state of the art object recognition architectures achieve impressive
performance but are typically specialized for a single depictive style (e.g.
photos only, sketches only). In this paper, we present SwiDeN : our
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which recognizes objects
regardless of how they are visually depicted (line drawing, realistic shaded
drawing, photograph etc.). In SwiDeN, we utilize a novel `deep' depictive
style-based switching mechanism which appropriately addresses the
depiction-specific and depiction-invariant aspects of the problem. We compare
SwiDeN with alternative architectures and prior work on a 50-category Photo-Art
dataset containing objects depicted in multiple styles. Experimental results
show that SwiDeN outperforms other approaches for the depiction-invariant
object recognition problem.
