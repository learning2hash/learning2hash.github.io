In this paper, we propose a new approach to perform supervised texture
classification/segmentation. The proposed idea is to feed a Fully Convolutional
Network with specific texture descriptors. These texture features are extracted
from images by using an empirical curvelet transform. We propose a method to
build a unique empirical curvelet filter bank adapted to a given dictionary of
textures. We then show that the output of these filters can be used to build
efficient texture descriptors utilized to finally feed deep learning networks.
Our approach is finally evaluated on several datasets and compare the results
to various state-of-the-art algorithms and show that the proposed method
dramatically outperform all existing ones.
