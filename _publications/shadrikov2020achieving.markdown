Recognizing blood relations using face images can be seen as an application
of face recognition systems with additional restrictions. These restrictions
proved to be difficult to deal with, however, recent advancements in face
verification show that there is still much to gain using more data and novel
ideas. As a result face recognition is a great source domain from which we can
transfer the knowledge to get better performance in kinship recognition as a
source domain. We present a new baseline for an automatic kinship recognition
task and relatives search based on RetinaFace[1] for face registration and
ArcFace[2] face verification model. With the approach described above as the
foundation, we constructed a pipeline that achieved state-of-the-art
performance on two tracks in the recent Recognizing Families In the Wild Data
Challenge.
