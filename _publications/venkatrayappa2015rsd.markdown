This paper introduces the new and powerful image patch descriptor based on
second order image statistics/derivatives. Here, the image patch is treated as
a 3D surface with intensity being the 3rd dimension. The considered 3D surface
has a rich set of second order features/statistics such as ridges, valleys,
cliffs and so on, that can be easily captured by using the difference of
rotating semi Gaussian filters. The originality of this method is based on
successfully combining the response of the directional filters with that of the
Difference of Gaussian (DOG) approach. The obtained descriptor shows a good
discriminative power when dealing with the variations in illumination, scale,
rotation, blur, viewpoint and compression. The experiments on image matching,
demonstrates the advantage of the obtained descriptor when compared to its
first order counterparts such as SIFT, DAISY, GLOH, GIST and LIDRIC.
