We propose a Historical Document Reading Challenge on Large Chinese
Structured Family Records, in short ICDAR2019 HDRC CHINESE. The objective of
the proposed competition is to recognize and analyze the layout, and finally
detect and recognize the textlines and characters of the large historical
document collection containing more than 20 000 pages kindly provided by
FamilySearch.
