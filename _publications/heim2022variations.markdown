We construct a new parametrization of double sequences \\(\\{A_\{n,k\}(s)\\}_\{n,k\}\\)
between \\(A_\{n,k\}(0)= \binom\{n-1\}\{k-1\}\\) and \\(A_\{n,k\}(1)=
\frac\{1\}\{n!\}\stirl\{n\}\{k\}\\), where \\(\stirl\{n\}\{k\}\\) are the unsigned Stirling
numbers of the first kind. For each \\(s\\) we prove a central limit theorem and a
local limit theorem. This extends the de\,Moivre--Laplace central limit theorem
and Goncharov's result, that unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind are
asymptotically normal. Herewith, we provide several applications.
