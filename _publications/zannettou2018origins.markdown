Internet memes are increasingly used to sway and manipulate public opinion.
This prompts the need to study their propagation, evolution, and influence
across the Web. In this paper, we detect and measure the propagation of memes
across multiple Web communities, using a processing pipeline based on
perceptual hashing and clustering techniques, and a dataset of 160M images from
2.6B posts gathered from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan's Politically Incorrect board
(/pol/), and Gab, over the course of 13 months. We group the images posted on
fringe Web communities (/pol/, Gab, and The_Donald subreddit) into clusters,
annotate them using meme metadata obtained from Know Your Meme, and also map
images from mainstream communities (Twitter and Reddit) to the clusters.
  Our analysis provides an assessment of the popularity and diversity of memes
in the context of each community, showing, e.g., that racist memes are
extremely common in fringe Web communities. We also find a substantial number
of politics-related memes on both mainstream and fringe Web communities,
supporting media reports that memes might be used to enhance or harm
politicians. Finally, we use Hawkes processes to model the interplay between
Web communities and quantify their reciprocal influence, finding that /pol/
substantially influences the meme ecosystem with the number of memes it
produces, while \td has a higher success rate in pushing them to other
communities.
