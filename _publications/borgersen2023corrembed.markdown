<p>Detecting visually similar images is a particularly useful attribute
to look to when calculating product recommendations. Embedding
similarity, which utilizes pre-trained computer vision models to extract
high-level image features, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in
identifying images with similar compositions. However, there is a lack
of methods for evaluating the embeddings generated by these models, as
conventional loss and performance metrics do not adequately capture
their performance in image similarity search tasks. In this paper, we
evaluate the viability of the image embeddings from numerous pre-trained
computer vision models using a novel approach named CorrEmbed. Our
approach computes the correlation between distances in image embeddings
and distances in human-generated tag vectors. We extensively evaluate
numerous pre-trained Torchvision models using this metric, revealing an
intuitive relationship of linear scaling between ImageNet1k accuracy
scores and tag-correlation scores. Importantly, our method also
identifies deviations from this pattern, providing insights into how
different models capture high-level image features. By offering a robust
performance evaluation of these pre-trained models, CorrEmbed serves as
a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop
effective, data-driven approaches to similar item recommendations in
fashion retail.</p>
