We present the MDS feature learning framework, in which multidimensional
scaling (MDS) is applied on high-level pairwise image distances to learn
fixed-length vector representations of images. The aspects of the images that
are captured by the learned features, which we call MDS features, completely
depend on what kind of image distance measurement is employed. With properly
selected semantics-sensitive image distances, the MDS features provide rich
semantic information about the images that is not captured by other feature
extraction techniques. In our work, we introduce the iterated
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solving MDS, and study the MDS feature
learning with IMage Euclidean Distance (IMED) and Spatial Pyramid Matching
(SPM) distance. We present experiments on both synthetic data and real images
--- the publicly accessible UIUC car image dataset. The MDS features based on
SPM distance achieve exceptional performance for the car recognition task.
