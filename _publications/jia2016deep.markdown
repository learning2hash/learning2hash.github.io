We present an accurate and robust method for six degree of freedom image
localization. There are two key-points of our method, 1. automatic immense
photo synthesis and labeling from point cloud model and, 2. pose estimation
with deep convolutional neural networks regression. Our model can directly
regresses 6-DOF camera poses from images, accurately describing where and how
it was captured. We achieved an accuracy within 1 meters and 1 degree on our
out-door dataset, which covers about 2 acres on our school campus.
