Spectral Toolkit of Algorithms for Graphs (STAG) is an open-source library
for efficient graph algorithms. This technical report presents the newly
implemented component on locality sensitive hashing, kernel density estimation,
and fast spectral clustering. The report includes a user's guide to the newly
implemented algorithms, experiments and demonstrations of the new
functionality, and several technical considerations behind our development.
