Most image-text retrieval work adopts binary labels indicating whether a pair
of image and text matches or not. Such a binary indicator covers only a limited
subset of image-text semantic relations, which is insufficient to represent
relevance degrees between images and texts described by continuous labels such
as image captions. The visual-semantic embedding space obtained by learning
binary labels is incoherent and cannot fully characterize the relevance
degrees. In addition to the use of binary labels, this paper further
incorporates continuous pseudo labels (generally approximated by text
similarity between captions) to indicate the relevance degrees. To learn a
coherent embedding space, we propose an image-text retrieval framework with
Binary and Continuous Label Supervision (BCLS), where binary labels are used to
guide the retrieval model to learn limited binary correlations, and continuous
labels are complementary to the learning of image-text semantic relations. For
the learning of binary labels, we improve the common Triplet ranking loss with
Soft Negative mining (Triplet-SN) to improve convergence. For the learning of
continuous labels, we design Kendall ranking loss inspired by Kendall rank
correlation coefficient (Kendall), which improves the correlation between the
similarity scores predicted by the retrieval model and the continuous labels.
To mitigate the noise introduced by the continuous pseudo labels, we further
design Sliding Window sampling and Hard Sample mining strategy (SW-HS) to
alleviate the impact of noise and reduce the complexity of our framework to the
same order of magnitude as the triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on
two image-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method can improve the
performance of state-of-the-art image-text retrieval models.
