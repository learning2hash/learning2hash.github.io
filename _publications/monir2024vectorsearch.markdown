Traditional retrieval methods have been essential for assessing document
similarity but struggle with capturing semantic nuances. Despite advancements
in latent semantic analysis (LSA) and deep learning, achieving comprehensive
semantic understanding and accurate retrieval remains challenging due to high
dimensionality and semantic gaps. The above challenges call for new techniques
to effectively reduce the dimensions and close the semantic gaps. To this end,
we propose VectorSearch, which leverages advanced algorithms, embeddings, and
indexing techniques for refined retrieval. By utilizing innovative multi-vector
search operations and encoding searches with advanced language models, our
approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that VectorSearch outperforms baseline metrics, demonstrating its
efficacy for large-scale retrieval tasks.
