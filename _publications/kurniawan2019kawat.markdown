We introduced KaWAT (Kata Word Analogy Task), a new word analogy task dataset
for Indonesian. We evaluated on it several existing pretrained Indonesian word
embeddings and embeddings trained on Indonesian online news corpus. We also
tested them on two downstream tasks and found that pretrained word embeddings
helped either by reducing the training epochs or yielding significant
performance gains.
