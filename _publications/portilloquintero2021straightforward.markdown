Video Retrieval is a challenging task where a text query is matched to a
video or vice versa. Most of the existing approaches for addressing such a
problem rely on annotations made by the users. Although simple, this approach
is not always feasible in practice. In this work, we explore the application of
the language-image model, CLIP, to obtain video representations without the
need for said annotations. This model was explicitly trained to learn a common
space where images and text can be compared. Using various techniques described
in this document, we extended its application to videos, obtaining
state-of-the-art results on the MSR-VTT and MSVD benchmarks.
