MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with approximately 22 nucleotides (nt)
that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursor molecules or
pre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large
number of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is
a challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences
with similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several
computational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this
paper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying
microRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary
structures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous
studies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the
literature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify
suitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector
machines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is
constructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the
accuracy of the classifier ensemble. Experimental results on a variety of
species demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method, and its
superiority over existing tools.
