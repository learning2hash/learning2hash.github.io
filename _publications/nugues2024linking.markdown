Diderot's \textit\{Encyclop\'edie\} is a reference work from XVIIIth century in
Europe that aimed at collecting the knowledge of its era. \textit\{Wikipedia\}
has the same ambition with a much greater scope. However, the lack of digital
connection between the two encyclopedias may hinder their comparison and the
study of how knowledge has evolved. A key element of \textit\{Wikipedia\} is
Wikidata that backs the articles with a graph of structured data. In this
paper, we describe the annotation of more than 10,300 of the
\textit\{Encyclop\'edie\} entries with Wikidata identifiers enabling us to
connect these entries to the graph. We considered geographic and human
entities. The \textit\{Encyclop\'edie\} does not contain biographic entries as
they mostly appear as subentries of locations. We extracted all the geographic
entries and we completely annotated all the entries containing a description of
human entities. This represents more than 2,600 links referring to locations or
human entities. In addition, we annotated more than 9,500 entries having a
geographic content only. We describe the annotation process as well as
application examples. This resource is available at
