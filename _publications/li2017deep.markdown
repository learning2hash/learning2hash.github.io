With the rapid growth of image and video data on the web, hashing has been
extensively studied for image or video search in recent years. Benefiting from
recent advances in deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising
results for image retrieval. However, there are some limitations of previous deep
hashing methods (e.g., the semantic information is not fully exploited). In this
paper, we develop a deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm based on the
assumption that the learned binary codes should be ideal for classification. Both the
pairwise label information and the classification information are used to learn the
hash codes within one stream framework. We constrain the outputs of the last layer
to be binary codes directly, which is rarely investigated in deep hashing algorithm.
Because of the discrete nature of hash codes, an alternating minimization method
is used to optimize the objective function. Experimental results have shown that
our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
