We construct the first non-gaussian ensemble that yields the optimal estimate
in the Dvoretzky-Milman Theorem: the ensemble exhibits almost Euclidean
sections in arbitrary normed spaces of the same dimension as the gaussian
embedding -- despite being very far from gaussian (in fact, it happens to be
heavy-tailed).
