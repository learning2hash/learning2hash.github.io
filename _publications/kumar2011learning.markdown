Many applications in Multilingual and Multimodal
Information Access involve searching large
databases of high dimensional data objects with
multiple (conditionally independent) views. In this
work we consider the problem of learning hash
functions for similarity search across the views
for such applications. We propose a principled
method for learning a hash function for each view
given a set of multiview training data objects. The
hash functions map similar objects to similar codes
across the views thus enabling cross-view similarity
search. We present results from an extensive
empirical study of the proposed approach
which demonstrate its effectiveness on Japanese
language People Search and Multilingual People
Search problems.
