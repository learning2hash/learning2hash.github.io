We consider some random series parametrised by complex binary strings. The
simplest case is that of Rademacher series, independent of a time parameter.
This is then extended to the case of Fourier series on the circle with
Rademacher coefficients. Finally, a specific Fourier series which has
coefficients determined by a computable function is shown to converge to an
algorithmically random Brownian motion.
