Let \\(C\subseteq \\{1,\ldots,k\\}^n\\) be such that for any \\(k\\) distinct elements
of \\(C\\) there exists a coordinate where they all differ simultaneously. Fredman
and Koml\'os studied upper and lower bounds on the largest cardinality of such
a set \\(C\\), in particular proving that as \\(n\to\infty\\), \\(|C|\leq \exp(n
k!/k^\{k-1\}+o(n))\\). Improvements over this result where first derived by
different authors for \\(k=4\\). More recently, Guruswami and Riazanov showed that
the coefficient \\(k!/k^\{k-1\}\\) is certainly not tight for any \\(k>3\\), although
they could only determine explicit improvements for \\(k=5,6\\). For larger \\(k\\),
their method gives numerical values modulo a conjecture on the maxima of
certain polynomials.
  In this paper, we first prove their conjecture, completing the explicit
computation of an improvement over the Fredman-Koml\'os bound for any \\(k\\).
Then, we develop a different method which gives substantial improvements for
\\(k=5,6\\).
