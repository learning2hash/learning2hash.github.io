Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\subseteq \\{1,\ldots,k\\}^n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} be such that for any \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} distinct elements of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} there exists a coordinate where they all differ simultaneously. Fredman and Koml\'os studied upper and lower bounds on the largest cardinality of such a set \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, in particular proving that as \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\to\infty\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, $|C|\leq \exp(n k!/k^\{k-1\}+o(n))$. Improvements over this result where first derived by different authors for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k=4\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. More recently, Guruswami and Riazanov showed that the coefficient \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k!/k^\{k-1\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is certainly not tight for any \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k>3\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, although they could only determine explicit improvements for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k=5,6\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. For larger \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, their method gives numerical values modulo a conjecture on the maxima of certain polynomials. In this paper, we first prove their conjecture, completing the explicit computation of an improvement over the Fredman-Koml\'os bound for any \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Then, we develop a different method which gives substantial improvements for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k=5,6\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
