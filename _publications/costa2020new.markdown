<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(C\subseteq \{1,\ldots,k\}^n\)</span>
be such that for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> distinct
elements of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> there exists a
coordinate where they all differ simultaneously. Fredman and Koml'os
studied upper and lower bounds on the largest cardinality of such a set
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, in particular proving that as
<span class="math inline">\(n\to\infty\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(|C|\leq \exp(n
k!/k^{k-1}+o(n))\)</span>. Improvements over this result where first
derived by different authors for <span
class="math inline">\(k=4\)</span>. More recently, Guruswami and
Riazanov showed that the coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(k!/k^{k-1}\)</span> is certainly not tight for any
<span class="math inline">\(k&gt;3\)</span>, although they could only
determine explicit improvements for <span
class="math inline">\(k=5,6\)</span>. For larger <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, their method gives numerical values
modulo a conjecture on the maxima of certain polynomials. In this paper,
we first prove their conjecture, completing the explicit computation of
an improvement over the Fredman-Koml'os bound for any <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Then, we develop a different method
which gives substantial improvements for <span
class="math inline">\(k=5,6\)</span>.</p>
