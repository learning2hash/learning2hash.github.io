At least since Priestley's 1765 Chart of Biography, large numbers of
individual person records have been used to illustrate aggregate patterns of
cultural history. Wikidata, the structured database sister of Wikipedia,
currently contains about 2.7 million explicit person records, across all
language versions of the encyclopedia. These individuals, notable according to
Wikipedia editing criteria, are connected via millions of hyperlinks between
their respective Wikipedia articles. This situation provides us with the chance
to go beyond the illustration of an idiosyncratic subset of individuals, as in
the case of Priestly. In this work we summarize the overlap of nationalities
and occupations, based on their co-occurrence in Wikidata individuals. We
construct networks of co-occurring nationalities and occupations, provide
insights into their respective community structure, and apply the results to
select and color chronologically structured subsets of a large network of
individuals, connected by Wikipedia hyperlinks. While the imagined communities
of nationality are much more discrete in terms of co-occurrence than
occupations, our quantifications reveal the existing overlap of nationality as
much less clear-cut than in case of occupational domains. Our work contributes
to a growing body of research using biographies of notable persons to analyze
cultural processes.
