The exponential growth of digital video content has posed critical challenges
in moment-level video retrieval, where existing methodologies struggle to
efficiently localize specific segments within an expansive video corpus.
Current retrieval systems are constrained by computational inefficiencies,
temporal context limitations, and the intrinsic complexity of navigating video
content. In this paper, we address these limitations through a novel
Interactive Video Corpus Moment Retrieval framework that integrates a
SuperGlobal Reranking mechanism and Adaptive Bidirectional Temporal Search
(ABTS), strategically optimizing query similarity, temporal stability, and
computational resources. By preprocessing a large corpus of videos using a
keyframe extraction model and deduplication technique through image hashing,
our approach provides a scalable solution that significantly reduces storage
requirements while maintaining high localization precision across diverse video
repositories.
