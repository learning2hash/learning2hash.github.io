In this demonstration, we present Country Guesser, a live system that guesses
the country that a photo is taken in. In particular, given a Google Street View
image, our federated ranking model uses a combination of computer vision,
machine learning and text retrieval methods to compute a ranking of likely
countries of the location shown in a given image from Street View.
Interestingly, using text-based features to probe large pre-trained language
models can assist to provide cross-modal supervision. We are not aware of
previous country guessing systems informed by visual and textual features.
