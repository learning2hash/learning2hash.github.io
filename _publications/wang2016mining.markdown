Fine-grained classification involves distinguishing between similar
sub-categories based on subtle differences in highly localized regions;
therefore, accurate localization of discriminative regions remains a major
challenge. We describe a patch-based framework to address this problem. We
introduce triplets of patches with geometric constraints to improve the
accuracy of patch localization, and automatically mine discriminative
geometrically-constrained triplets for classification. The resulting approach
only requires object bounding boxes. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using
four publicly available fine-grained datasets, on which it outperforms or
achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in classification.
