This short position paper provides a manually curated list of non-English
image captioning datasets (as of May 2024). Through this list, we can observe
the dearth of datasets in different languages: only 23 different languages are
represented. With the addition of the Crossmodal-3600 dataset (Thapliyal et
al., 2022, 36 languages) this number increases somewhat, but still this number
is small compared to the +/-500 institutional languages that are out there.
This paper closes with some open questions for the field of Vision & Language.
