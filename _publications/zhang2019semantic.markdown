Deep hashing models have been proposed as an efficient method for large45;scale similarity search. However most existing deep hashing methods only utilize fine45;level labels for training while ignoring the natural semantic hierarchy structure. This paper presents an effective method that preserves the classwise similarity of full45;level semantic hierarchy for large45;scale image retrieval. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method helps improve the fine45;level retrieval performance. Moreover with the help of the semantic hierarchy it can produce significantly better binary codes for hierarchical retrieval which indicates its potential of providing more user45;desired retrieval results.
