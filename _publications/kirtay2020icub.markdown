This document presents novel datasets, constructed by employing the iCub
robot equipped with an additional depth sensor and color camera. We used the
robot to acquire color and depth information for 210 objects in different
acquisition scenarios. At this end, the results were large scale datasets for
robot and computer vision applications: object representation, object
recognition and classification, and action recognition.
