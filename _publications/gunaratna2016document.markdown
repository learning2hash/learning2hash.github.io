Document retrieval has been an important research problem over many years in
the information retrieval community. State-of-the-art techniques utilize
various methods in matching documents to a given document including keywords,
phrases, and annotations. In this paper, we propose a new approach for document
retrieval that utilizes predications (subject-predicate-object triples)
extracted from the documents. We represent documents as sets of predications.
We measure the similarity between predications to compute the similarity
between documents. Our approach utilizes the hierarchical information available
in ontologies in computing concept-concept similarity, making the approach
flexible. Predication-based document similarity is more precise and forms the
basis for a semantically aware document retrieval system. We show that the
approach is competitive with an existing state-of-the-art related document
retrieval technique in the biomedical domain.
