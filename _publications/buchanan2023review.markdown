Since 2016, NIST has been assessing lightweight encryption methods, and, in
2022, NIST published the final 10: ASCON, Elephant, GIFT-COFB, Grain128-AEAD,
ISAP, Photon-Beetle, Romulus, Sparkle, TinyJambu, and Xoodyak. At the time that
the article was written, NISC announced ASCOn as the chosen method that will be
published as NIST'S lightweight cryptography standard later in 2023. In this
article, we provide a comparison between these methods in terms of energy
efficiency, time for encryption, and time for hashing.
