<p>Since 2016, NIST has been assessing lightweight encryption methods,
and, in 2022, NIST published the final 10: ASCON, Elephant, GIFT-COFB,
Grain128-AEAD, ISAP, Photon-Beetle, Romulus, Sparkle, TinyJambu, and
Xoodyak. At the time that the article was written, NISC announced ASCOn
as the chosen method that will be published as NIST’S lightweight
cryptography standard later in 2023. In this article, we provide a
comparison between these methods in terms of energy efficiency, time for
encryption, and time for hashing.</p>
