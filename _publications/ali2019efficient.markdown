Data analysis require a pairwise proximity measure over objects. Recent work
has extended this to situations where the distance information between objects
is given as comparison results of distances between three objects (triplets).
Humans find the comparison tasks much easier than the exact distance
computation and such data can be easily obtained in big quantity via
crowd-sourcing. In this work, we propose triplets augmentation, an efficient
method to extend the triplets data by inferring the hidden implicit information
form the existing data. Triplets augmentation improves the quality of
kernel-based and kernel-free data analytics. We also propose a novel set of
algorithms for common data analysis tasks based on triplets. These methods work
directly with triplets and avoid kernel evaluations, thus are scalable to big
data. We demonstrate that our methods outperform the current best-known
techniques and are robust to noisy data.
