Oneway real functions are effective maps on positive-measure sets of reals
that preserve randomness and have no effective probabilistic inversions. We
construct a oneway real function which is collision-resistant: the probability
of effectively producing distinct reals with the same image is zero, and each
real has uncountable inverse image.
