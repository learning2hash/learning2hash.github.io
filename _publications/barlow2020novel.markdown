Protecting and preventing sensitive data from being used inappropriately has
become a challenging task. Even a small mistake in securing data can be
exploited by phishing attacks to release private information such as passwords
or financial information to a malicious actor. Phishing has now proven so
successful; it is the number one attack vector. Many approaches have been
proposed to protect against this type of cyber-attack, from additional staff
training, enriched spam filters to large collaborative databases of known
threats such as PhishTank and OpenPhish. However, they mostly rely upon a user
falling victim to an attack and manually adding this new threat to the shared
pool, which presents a constant disadvantage in the fightback against phishing.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect against phishing attacks
using binary visualisation and machine learning. Unlike previous work in this
field, our approach uses an automated detection process and requires no further
user interaction, which allows a faster and more accurate detection process.
The experiment results show that our approach has a high detection rate
