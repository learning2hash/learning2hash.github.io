In this paper we present a new classification method based on Dictionary
Learning (DL). The main contribution consists of a kernel version of incoherent
DL, derived from its standard linear counterpart. We also propose an
improvement of the AK-SVD algorithm concerning the representation update. Our
algorithms are tested on several popular databases of classification problems.
