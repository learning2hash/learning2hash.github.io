The dark web has emerged as the state-of-the-art solution for enhanced
anonymity. Just like a double-edged sword, it also inadvertently becomes the
safety net and breeding ground for illicit activities. Among them,
cryptocurrencies have been prevalently abused to receive illicit income while
evading regulations. Despite the continuing efforts to combat illicit
activities, there is still a lack of an in-depth understanding regarding the
characteristics and dynamics of cryptocurrency abuses on the dark web. In this
work, we conduct a multi-dimensional and systematic study to track
cryptocurrency-related illicit activities and campaigns on the dark web. We
first harvest a dataset of 4,923 cryptocurrency-related onion sites with over
130K pages. Then, we detect and extract the illicit blockchain transactions to
characterize the cryptocurrency abuses, targeting features from
single/clustered addresses and illicit campaigns. Throughout our study, we have
identified 2,564 illicit sites with 1,189 illicit blockchain addresses, which
account for 90.8 BTC in revenue. Based on their inner connections, we further
identify 66 campaigns behind them. Our exploration suggests that illicit
activities on the dark web have strong correlations, which can guide us to
identify new illicit blockchain addresses and onions, and raise alarms at the
early stage of their deployment.
