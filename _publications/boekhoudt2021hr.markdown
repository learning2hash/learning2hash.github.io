The automatic detection of anomalies captured by surveillance settings is
essential for speeding the otherwise laborious approach. To date, UCF-Crime is
the largest available dataset for automatic visual analysis of anomalies and
consists of real-world crime scenes of various categories. In this paper, we
introduce HR-Crime, a subset of the UCF-Crime dataset suitable for
human-related anomaly detection tasks. We rely on state-of-the-art techniques
to build the feature extraction pipeline for human-related anomaly detection.
Furthermore, we present the baseline anomaly detection analysis on the
HR-Crime. HR-Crime as well as the developed feature extraction pipeline and the
extracted features will be publicly available for further research in the
field.
