Given the growing number of patents filed in multiple countries, users are
interested in retrieving patents across languages. We propose a multi-lingual
patent retrieval system, which translates a user query into the target
language, searches a multilingual database for patents relevant to the query,
and improves the browsing efficiency by way of machine translation and
clustering. Our system also extracts new translations from patent families
consisting of comparable patents, to enhance the translation dictionary.
