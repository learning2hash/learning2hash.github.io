Recent embedding-based methods in unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction
have shown good results, but generally have not leveraged orthographic
(spelling) information, which can be helpful for pairs of related languages.
This work augments a state-of-the-art method with orthographic features, and
extends prior work in this space by proposing methods that can learn and
utilize orthographic correspondences even between languages with different
scripts. We demonstrate this by experimenting on three language pairs with
different scripts and varying degrees of lexical similarity.
