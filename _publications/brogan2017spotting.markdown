As image tampering becomes ever more sophisticated and commonplace, the need for
image forensics algorithms that can accurately and quickly detect forgeries
grows. In this paper, we revisit the ideas of image querying and retrieval to
provide clues to better localize forgeries. We propose a method to perform
large-scale image forensics on the order of one million images using the help of
an image search algorithm and database to gather contextual clues as to where
tampering may have taken place. In this vein, we introduce five new strongly
invariant image comparison methods and test their effectiveness under heavy
noise, rotation, and color space changes. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of
these methods compared to passive image forensics using Nimble
[https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/nimble-challenge], a new, state-of-the-art
dataset from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
