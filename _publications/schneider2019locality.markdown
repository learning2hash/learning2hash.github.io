This work investigates fundamental questions related to learning features in
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Empirical findings across multiple
architectures such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet and MobileNet indicate
that weights near the center of a filter are larger than weights on the
outside. Current regularization schemes violate this principle. Thus, we
introduce Locality-promoting Regularization (LOCO-Reg), which yields accuracy
gains across multiple architectures and datasets. We also show theoretically
that the empirical finding is a consequence of maximizing feature cohesion
under the assumption of spatial locality.
