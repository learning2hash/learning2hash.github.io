We present Typography-MNIST (TMNIST), a dataset comprising of 565,292
MNIST-style grayscale images representing 1,812 unique glyphs in varied styles
of 1,355 Google-fonts. The glyph-list contains common characters from over 150
of the modern and historical language scripts with symbol sets, and each
font-style represents varying subsets of the total unique glyphs. The dataset
has been developed as part of the CognitiveType project which aims to develop
eye-tracking tools for real-time mapping of type to cognition and to create
computational tools that allow for the easy design of typefaces with cognitive
properties such as readability. The dataset and scripts to generate MNIST-style
images for glyphs in different font styles are freely available at
