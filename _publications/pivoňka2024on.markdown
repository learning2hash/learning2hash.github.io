Re-ranking is the second stage of a visual place recognition task, in which
the system chooses the best-matching images from a pre-selected subset of
candidates. Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a
spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need
for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation
between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard
local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It
introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily
for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness
to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with
long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new
visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector
(Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public
datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path
for long-term visual place recognition.
