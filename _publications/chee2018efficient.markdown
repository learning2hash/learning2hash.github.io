Tandem duplication is the process of inserting a copy of a segment of DNA
adjacent to the original position. Motivated by applications that store data in
living organisms, Jain et al. (2017) proposed the study of codes that correct
tandem duplications. Known code constructions are based on \{\em irreducible
words\}.
  We study efficient encoding/decoding methods for irreducible words. First, we
describe an \((\ell,m)\)-finite state encoder and show that when
\(m=\Theta(1/\epsilon)\) and \(\ell=\Theta(1/\epsilon)\), the encoder achieves rate
that is \(\epsilon\) away from the optimal. Next, we provide ranking/unranking
algorithms for irreducible words and modify the algorithms to reduce the space
requirements for the finite state encoder.
