<p>To retrieve personalized campaigns and creatives while protecting
user privacy, digital advertising is shifting from member-based identity
to cohort-based identity. Under such identity regime, an accurate and
efficient cohort building algorithm is desired to group users with
similar characteristics. In this paper, we propose a scalable <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-anonymous cohort building algorithm
called {} (CCWS). The proposed method combines the spirit of the (<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-powered) consistent weighted sampling
and hierarchical clustering, so that the <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-anonymity is ensured by enforcing a
lower bound on the size of cohorts. Evaluations on a LinkedIn dataset
consisting of <span class="math inline">\(&gt;70\)</span>M users and ads
campaigns demonstrate that CCWS achieves substantial improvements over
several hashing-based methods including sign random projections
(SignRP), minwise hashing (MinHash), as well as the vanilla CWS.</p>
