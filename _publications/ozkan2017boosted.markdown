Activity recognition from first-person (ego-centric) videos has recently
gained attention due to the increasing ubiquity of the wearable cameras. There
has been a surge of efforts adapting existing feature descriptors and designing
new descriptors for the first-person videos. An effective activity recognition
system requires selection and use of complementary features and appropriate
kernels for each feature. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework for
first-person activity recognition which effectively selects and combines
features and their respective kernels during the training. Our experimental
results show that use of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and Boosted MKL in
first-person activity recognition problem exhibits improved results in
comparison to the state-of-the-art. In addition, these techniques enable the
expansion of the framework with new features in an efficient and convenient
way.
