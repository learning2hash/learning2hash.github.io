In this paper we introduce the notion of weak differential subordination for
martingales and show that a Banach space \\(X\\) is a UMD Banach space if and only
if for all \\(p\in (1,\infty)\\) and all purely discontinuous \\(X\\)-valued
martingales \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) such that \\(N\\) is weakly differentially subordinated to
\\(M\\), one has the estimate \\(\mathbb E \|N_\{\infty\}\|^p \leq C_p\mathbb E
\|M_\{\infty\}\|^p\\). As a corollary we derive the sharp estimate for the norms of
a broad class of even Fourier multipliers, which includes e.g. the second order
Riesz transforms.
