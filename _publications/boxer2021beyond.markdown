Two objects may be close in the Hausdorff metric, yet have very different
geometric and topological properties. We examine other methods of comparing
digital images such that objects close in each of these measures have some
similar geometric or topological property. Such measures may be combined with
the Hausdorff metric to yield a metric in which close images are similar with
respect to multiple properties.
