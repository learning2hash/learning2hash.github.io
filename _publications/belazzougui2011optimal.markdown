Sequence representations supporting queries \\(access\\), \\(select\\) and \\(rank\\) are
at the core of many data structures. There is a considerable gap between the
various upper bounds and the few lower bounds known for such representations,
and how they relate to the space used. In this article we prove a strong lower
bound for \\(rank\\), which holds for rather permissive assumptions on the space
used, and give matching upper bounds that require only a compressed
representation of the sequence. Within this compressed space, operations
\\(access\\) and \\(select\\) can be solved in constant or almost-constant time, which
is optimal for large alphabets. Our new upper bounds dominate all of the
previous work in the time/space map.
