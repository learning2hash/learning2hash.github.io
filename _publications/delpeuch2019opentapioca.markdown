We propose a simple Named Entity Linking system that can be trained from
Wikidata only. This demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of this data
source for this task and provides an easily reproducible baseline to compare
other systems against. Our model is lightweight to train, to run and to keep
synchronous with Wikidata in real time.
