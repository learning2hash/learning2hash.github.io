The monomial codes over a Galois field F_q that can be thought invariant
subspaces are essential to us in this study. More specifically, we look into
the link between monomial codes and characteristic subspaces and the
decomposition of monomial codes into minimal invariant subspaces. Additionally,
we study some of the characteristics of monomial codes and generalize them by
proposing the idea of generalized monomial codes.
