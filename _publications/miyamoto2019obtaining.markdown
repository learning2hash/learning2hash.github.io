A tiling of the \(n\)-dimensional Hamming cube gives rise to a perfect code
(according to a given metric) if the basic tile is a metric ball. We are
concerned with metrics on the \(n\)-dimensional Hamming cube which are determined
by a weight which respects support of vectors (TS-metrics). We consider the
known tilings of the Hamming cube and first determine which of them give rise
to a perfect code. In the sequence, for those tilings that satisfy this
condition, we determine all the TS-metrics that turns it into a perfect code.
We also propose the construction of new perfect codes obtained by the
concatenation of two smaller ones.
