For \\(d \in \\{1,2,3\\}\\), let \\((B^d_t;~ t \geq 0)\\) be a \\(d\\)-dimensional standard
Brownian motion. We study the \\(d\\)-Brownian span set \\(Span(d):=\\{t-s;~
B^d_s=B^d_t~\mbox\{for some\}~0 \leq s \leq t\\}\\). We prove that almost surely the
random set \\(Span(d)\\) is \\(\sigma\\)-compact and dense in \\(\mathbb\{R\}_\{+\}\\). In
addition, we show that \\(Span(1)=\mathbb\{R\}_\{+\}\\) almost surely; the Lebesgue
measure of \\(Span(2)\\) is \\(0\\) almost surely and its Hausdorff dimension is \\(1\\)
almost surely; and the Hausdorff dimension of \\(Span(3)\\) is \\(\frac\{1\}\{2\}\\) almost
surely. We also list a number of conjectures and open problems.
