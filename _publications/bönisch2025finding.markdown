We introduce a retrieval approach leveraging Support Vector Regression (SVR)
ensembles, bootstrap aggregation (bagging), and embedding spaces on the German
Dataset for Legal Information Retrieval (GerDaLIR). By conceptualizing the
retrieval task in terms of multiple binary needle-in-a-haystack subtasks, we
show improved recall over the baselines (0.849 > 0.803 | 0.829) using our
voting ensemble, suggesting promising initial results, without training or
fine-tuning any deep learning models. Our approach holds potential for further
enhancement, particularly through refining the encoding models and optimizing
hyperparameters.
