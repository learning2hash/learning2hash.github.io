Sparse representation has been widely used in data compression, signal and
image denoising, dimensionality reduction and computer vision. While
overcomplete dictionaries are required for sparse representation of
multidimensional data, orthogonal bases represent one-dimensional data well. In
this paper, we propose a data-driven sparse representation using orthonormal
bases under the lossless compression constraint. We show that imposing such
constraint under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle leads to a
unique and optimal sparse representation for one-dimensional data, which
results in discriminative features useful for data discovery.
