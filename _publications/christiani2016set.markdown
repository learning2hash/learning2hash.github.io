We consider the problem of approximate set similarity search under Braun-Blanquet similarity $B(\mathbf\{x\}, \mathbf\{y\}) = |\mathbf\{x\} \cap \mathbf\{y\}| / \max(|\mathbf\{x\}|, |\mathbf\{y\}|)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. The \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}(b\_2, b\_2)$-approximate Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(P\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} such that, given a query set \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbf\{q\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, if there exists $\mathbf\{x\} \in P\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( with \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}B(\mathbf\{q\}, \mathbf\{x\}) \geq b\_1$, then we can efficiently return \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbf\{x\}' \in P\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} with \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(B(\mathbf\{q\}, \mathbf\{x\}') > b\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^\{1+\rho\}\log n + \sum\_\{\mathbf\{x\} \in P\}|\mathbf\{x\}|)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and query time \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(|\mathbf\{q\}|n^\{\rho\} \log n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n = |P|\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and $\rho = \log(1/b\_1)/\log(1/b\_2)$. Making use of existing lower bounds for locality-sensitive hashing by O'Donnell et al. (TOCT 2014) we show that this value of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of constants \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(0 < b\_2 < b\_1 < 1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves upon the value of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} that can be obtained through the use of state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani locality-sensitive hashing framework (STOC 1998) such as Broder's MinHash (CCS 1997) for Jaccard similarity and Andoni et al.'s cross-polytope LSH (NIPS 2015) for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the currently best data-dependent method by Andoni and Razenshteyn (STOC 2015).
