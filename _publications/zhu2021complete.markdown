Recently, \\(b\\)-symbol codes are proposed to protect against \\(b\\)-symbol errors
in \\(b\\)-symbol read channels. It is an interesting subject of study to consider
the complete \\(b\\)-symbol weight distribution of cyclic codes since \\(b\\)-symbol
metric is a generalization for Hamming metric. The complete \\(b\\)-symbol Hamming
weight distribution of irreducible codes is known in only a few cases. In this
paper, we give a complete \\(b\\)-symbol Hamming weight distribution of a class of
irreducible codes with two nonzero \\(b\\)-symbol Hamming weights.
