Twitter as a micro-blogging platform rose to instant fame mainly due to its
minimalist features that allow seamless communication between users. As the
conversations grew thick and faster, a placeholder feature called as Hashtags
became important as it captured the themes behind the tweets. Prior studies
have investigated the conversation dynamics, inter-play with other media
platforms and communication patterns between users for specific event-based
hashtags such as the \#Occupy movement. Commonplace hashtags which are used on a
daily basis have been largely ignored due to their seemingly innocuous presence
in tweets and also due to the lack of connection with real-world events.
However, it can be postulated that utility of these hashtags is the main reason
behind their continued usage. This study is aimed at understanding the
rationale behind the usage of a particular type of commonplace hashtags -
location hashtags such as country and city name hashtags. Tweets with the
hashtag \#singapore were extracted for one week duration. Manual and automatic
tweet classification was performed along with social network analysis, to
identify the underlying themes. Seven themes were identified. Findings indicate
that the hashtag is prominent in tweets about local events, local news, users
current location and landmark related information sharing. Users who share
content from social media sites such as Instagram make use of the hashtag in a
more prominent way when compared to users who post textual content. News
agencies, commercial bodies and celebrities make use of the hashtag more than
common individuals. Overall, the results show the non-conversational nature of
the hashtag. The findings are to be validated with other country names and
cross-validated with hashtag data from other social media platforms.
