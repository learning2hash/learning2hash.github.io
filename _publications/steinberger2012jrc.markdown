EuroVoc (2012) is a highly multilingual thesaurus consisting of over 6,700
hierarchically organised subject domains used by European Institutions and many
authorities in Member States of the European Union (EU) for the classification
and retrieval of official documents. JEX is JRC-developed multi-label
classification software that learns from manually labelled data to
automatically assign EuroVoc descriptors to new documents in a profile-based
category-ranking task. The JEX release consists of trained classifiers for 22
official EU languages, of parallel training data in the same languages, of an
interface that allows viewing and amending the assignment results, and of a
module that allows users to re-train the tool on their own document
collections. JEX allows advanced users to change the document representation so
as to possibly improve the categorisation result through linguistic
pre-processing. JEX can be used as a tool for interactive EuroVoc descriptor
assignment to increase speed and consistency of the human categorisation
process, or it can be used fully automatically. The output of JEX is a
language-independent EuroVoc feature vector lending itself also as input to
various other Language Technology tasks, including cross-lingual clustering and
classification, cross-lingual plagiarism detection, sentence selection and
ranking, and more.
