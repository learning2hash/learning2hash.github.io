Because of the spread of the Internet, social platforms become big data
pools. From there we can learn about the trends, culture and hot topics. This
project focuses on analyzing the data from Instagram. It shows the relationship
of Instagram filter data with location and number of likes to give users filter
suggestion on achieving more likes based on their location. It also analyzes
the popular hashtags in different locations to show visual culture differences
between different cities.
