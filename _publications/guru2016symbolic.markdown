In this paper, a model for classification of logos based on symbolic
representation of features is presented. The proposed model makes use of global
features of logo images such as color, texture, and shape features for
classification. The logo images are broadly classified into three different
classes, viz., logo image containing only text, an image with only symbol, and
an image with both text and a symbol. In each class, the similar looking logo
images are clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The intra-cluster
variations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then
preserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are
represented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then
classified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose,
relatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo
images. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy,
precision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed
model, the comparative analyses are given against the other models. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms the other models with respect to time
and F-measure.
