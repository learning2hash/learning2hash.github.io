The scientific image integrity area presents a challenging research
bottleneck, the lack of available datasets to design and evaluate forensic
techniques. Its data sensitivity creates a legal hurdle that prevents one to
rely on real tampered cases to build any sort of accessible forensic benchmark.
To mitigate this bottleneck, we present an extendable open-source library that
reproduces the most common image forgery operations reported by the research
integrity community: duplication, retouching, and cleaning. Using this library
and realistic scientific images, we create a large scientific forgery image
benchmark (39,423 images) with an enriched ground-truth. In addition, concerned
about the high number of retracted papers due to image duplication, this work
evaluates the state-of-the-art copy-move detection methods in the proposed
dataset, using a new metric that asserts consistent match detection between the
source and the copied region. The dataset and source-code will be freely
available upon acceptance of the paper.
