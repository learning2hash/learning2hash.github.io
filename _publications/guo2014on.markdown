In this paper we study w-frameproof codes which are equivalent to 1w-separating hash families. Our main results concern binary codes which are defined over an alphabet of two symbols. For all w geq 3 and for w+1 leq N leq 3w we show that an SHF(N; n2 1w ) exists only if n leq N and an SHF(N; N2 1w ) must be a permutation matrix of degree N.
