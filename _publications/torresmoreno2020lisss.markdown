In this work we present a new small data-set in Computational Creativity (CC)
field, the Spanish Literary Sentences for emotions detection corpus (LISSS). We
address this corpus of literary sentences in order to evaluate or design
algorithms of emotions classification and detection. We have constitute this
corpus by manually classifying the sentences in a set of emotions: Love, Fear,
Happiness, Anger and Sadness/Pain. We also present some baseline classification
algorithms applied on our corpus. The LISSS corpus will be available to the
community as a free resource to evaluate or create CC-like algorithms.
