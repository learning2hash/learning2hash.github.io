Recent years have witnessed wide application of
hashing for large-scale image retrieval. However,
most existing hashing methods are based on handcrafted features which might not be optimally compatible with the hashing procedure. Recently, deep
hashing methods have been proposed to perform simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning with deep neural networks, which have shown
better performance than traditional hashing methods with hand-crafted features. Most of these deep
hashing methods are supervised whose supervised
information is given with triplet labels. For another common application scenario with pairwise labels, there have not existed methods for simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method,
called deep pairwise-supervised hashing (DPSH),
to perform simultaneous feature learning and hashcode learning for applications with pairwise labels.
Experiments on real datasets show that our DPSH
method can outperform other methods to achieve
the state-of-the-art performance in image retrieval
applications.
