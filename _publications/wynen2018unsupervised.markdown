In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach to
automatically discover, summarize, and manipulate artistic styles from large
collections of paintings. Our method is based on archetypal analysis, which is
an unsupervised learning technique akin to sparse coding with a geometric
interpretation. When applied to deep image representations from a collection of
artworks, it learns a dictionary of archetypal styles, which can be easily
visualized. After training the model, the style of a new image, which is
characterized by local statistics of deep visual features, is approximated by a
sparse convex combination of archetypes. This enables us to interpret which
archetypal styles are present in the input image, and in which proportion.
Finally, our approach allows us to manipulate the coefficients of the latent
archetypal decomposition, and achieve various special effects such as style
enhancement, transfer, and interpolation between multiple archetypes.
