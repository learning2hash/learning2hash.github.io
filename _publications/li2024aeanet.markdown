Arbitrary artistic style transfer is a research area that combines rational
academic study with emotive artistic creation. It aims to create a new image
from a content image according to a target artistic style, maintaining the
content's textural structural information while incorporating the artistic
characteristics of the style image. However, existing style transfer methods
often significantly damage the texture lines of the content image during the
style transformation. To address these issues, we propose affinity-enhanced
attentional network, which include the content affinity-enhanced attention
(CAEA) module, the style affinity-enhanced attention (SAEA) module, and the
hybrid attention (HA) module. The CAEA and SAEA modules first use attention to
enhance content and style representations, followed by a detail enhanced (DE)
module to reinforce detail features. The hybrid attention module adjusts the
style feature distribution based on the content feature distribution. We also
introduce the local dissimilarity loss based on affinity attention, which
better preserves the affinity with content and style images. Experiments
demonstrate that our work achieves better results in arbitrary style transfer
than other state-of-the-art methods.
