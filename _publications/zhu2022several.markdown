It is well-known that few-weight linear codes have better applications in
secret sharing schemes \cite\{JY2006,CC2005\}.In particular, projective
two-weight codes are very precious as they are closely related to finite
projective spaces, strongly regular graphs and combinatorial designs
\cite\{RC1986,CD2018,P1972\}. Here, we present the following two applications.
