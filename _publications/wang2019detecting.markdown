Most malicious photo manipulations are created using standard image editing
tools, such as Adobe Photoshop. We present a method for detecting one very
popular Photoshop manipulation -- image warping applied to human faces -- using
a model trained entirely using fake images that were automatically generated by
scripting Photoshop itself. We show that our model outperforms humans at the
task of recognizing manipulated images, can predict the specific location of
edits, and in some cases can be used to "undo" a manipulation to reconstruct
the original, unedited image. We demonstrate that the system can be
successfully applied to real, artist-created image manipulations.
