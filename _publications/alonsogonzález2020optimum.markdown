In this paper, we study flag codes on the vector space \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\),
being \\(q\\) a prime power and \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q\\) the finite field of \\(q\\) elements.
More precisely, we focus on flag codes that attain the maximum possible
distance (optimum distance flag codes) and can be obtained from a spread of
\\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\). We characterize the set of admissible type vectors for this
family of flag codes and also provide a construction of them based on
well-known results about perfect matchings in graphs. This construction attains
both the maximum distance for its type vector and the largest possible
cardinality for that distance.
