Video annotation is a critical and time-consuming task in computer vision
research and applications. This paper presents a novel annotation pipeline that
uses pre-extracted features and dimensionality reduction to accelerate the
temporal video annotation process. Our approach uses Hierarchical Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) to create a multi-scale representation of video
features, allowing annotators to efficiently explore and label large video
datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in annotation effort compared
to traditional linear methods, achieving more than a 10x reduction in clicks
required for annotating over 12 hours of video. Our experiments on multiple
datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our pipeline across various
scenarios. Moreover, we investigate the optimal configuration of HSNE
parameters for different datasets. Our work provides a promising direction for
scaling up video annotation efforts in the era of video understanding.
