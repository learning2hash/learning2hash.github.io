In this paper, we investigate the counter-forensic effects of the new JPEG AI
standard based on neural image compression, focusing on two critical areas:
deepfake image detection and image splicing localization. Neural image
compression leverages advanced neural network algorithms to achieve higher
compression rates while maintaining image quality. However, it introduces
artifacts that closely resemble those generated by image synthesis techniques
and image splicing pipelines, complicating the work of researchers when
discriminating pristine from manipulated content. We comprehensively analyze
JPEG AI's counter-forensic effects through extensive experiments on several
state-of-the-art detectors and datasets. Our results demonstrate a reduction in
the performance of leading forensic detectors when analyzing content processed
through JPEG AI. By exposing the vulnerabilities of the available forensic
tools, we aim to raise the urgent need for multimedia forensics researchers to
include JPEG AI images in their experimental setups and develop robust forensic
techniques to distinguish between neural compression artifacts and actual
manipulations.
