This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of a pretrained multimodal
model, CLIP, in recognizing emotions evoked by abstract visual art. We employ a
dataset comprising images with associated emotion labels and textual rationales
of these labels provided by human annotators. We perform linguistic analyses of
rationales, zero-shot emotion classification of images and rationales, apply
similarity-based prediction of emotion, and investigate color-emotion
associations. The relatively low, yet above baseline, accuracy in recognizing
emotion for abstract images and rationales suggests that CLIP decodes emotional
complexities in a manner not well aligned with human cognitive processes.
Furthermore, we explore color-emotion interactions in images and rationales.
Expected color-emotion associations, such as red relating to anger, are
identified in images and texts annotated with emotion labels by both humans and
CLIP, with the latter showing even stronger interactions. Our results highlight
the disparity between human processing and machine processing when connecting
image features and emotions.
