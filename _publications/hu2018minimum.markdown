Motivated by applications in combinatorial design theory and constructing LCD
codes, C. Ding et al \cite\{DLX\} introduced cyclic codes \(\mho(q,m,h)\) and
\(\bar\mho(q,m,h)\) over \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\) as new generalization and version of the
punctured binary Reed-Muller codes. In this paper, we show several new results
on minimum distance of \(\mho(q,m,h)\) and \(\bar\mho(q,m,h)\) which are
generalization or improvement of previous results given in \cite\{DLX\}.
