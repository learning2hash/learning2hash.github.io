The chemical sciences are producing an unprecedented amount of large,
high-dimensional data sets containing chemical structures and associated
properties. However, there are currently no algorithms to visualize such data
while preserving both global and local features with a sufficient level of
detail to allow for human inspection and interpretation. Here, we propose a
solution to this problem with a new data visualization method, TMAP, capable of
representing data sets of up to millions of data points and arbitrary high
dimensionality as a two-dimensional tree (http://tmap.gdb.tools).
Visualizations based on TMAP are better suited than t-SNE or UMAP for the
exploration and interpretation of large data sets due to their tree-like
nature, increased local and global neighborhood and structure preservation, and
the transparency of the methods the algorithm is based on. We apply TMAP to the
most used chemistry data sets including databases of molecules such as ChEMBL,
FDB17, the Natural Products Atlas, DSSTox, as well as to the MoleculeNet
benchmark collection of data sets. We also show its broad applicability with
further examples from biology, particle physics, and literature.
