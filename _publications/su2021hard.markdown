Compared with the traditional hashing methods deep hashing methods generate hash codes with rich semantic information and greatly improves the performances in the image retrieval field. However it is unsatisfied for current deep hashing methods to predict the similarity of hard examples. It exists two main factors affecting the ability of learning hard examples which are weak key features extraction and the shortage of hard examples. In this paper we give a novel end45;to45;end model to extract the key feature from hard examples and obtain hash code with the accurate semantic information. In addition we redesign a hard pair45;wise loss function to assess the hard degree and update penalty weights of examples. It effectively alleviates the shortage problem in hard examples. Experimental results on CIFAR45;10 and NUS45;WIDE demonstrate that our model outperformances the mainstream hashing45;based image retrieval methods.
