In this paper we present NorQuAD: the first Norwegian question answering
dataset for machine reading comprehension. The dataset consists of 4,752
manually created question-answer pairs. We here detail the data collection
procedure and present statistics of the dataset. We also benchmark several
multilingual and Norwegian monolingual language models on the dataset and
compare them against human performance. The dataset will be made freely
available.
