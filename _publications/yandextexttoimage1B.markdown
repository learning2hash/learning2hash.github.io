Yandex Text-to-Image-1B is a new cross-model dataset (text and visual), where database and query vectors have different distributions in a shared representation space. The base set consists of Image embeddings produced by the Se-ResNext-101 model, and queries are textual embeddings produced by a variant of the DSSM model. Since the distributions are different, a 50M sample of the query distribution is provided.
