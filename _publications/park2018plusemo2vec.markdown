This paper describes our system that has been submitted to SemEval-2018 Task
1: Affect in Tweets (AIT) to solve five subtasks. We focus on modeling both
sentence and word level representations of emotion inside texts through large
distantly labeled corpora with emojis and hashtags. We transfer the emotional
knowledge by exploiting neural network models as feature extractors and use
these representations for traditional machine learning models such as support
vector regression (SVR) and logistic regression to solve the competition tasks.
Our system is placed among the Top3 for all subtasks we participated.
