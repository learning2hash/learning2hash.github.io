The monotone minimal perfect hash function (MMPHF) problem is the following indexing problem. Given a set \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(S= \\{s\_1,\ldots,s\_n\\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} distinct keys from a universe \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(U\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(u\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, create a data structure \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(DS\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} that answers the following query: \[ RankOp(q) = \text\{rank of \} q \text\{ in \} S \text\{ for all \} q\in S ~\text\{ and arbitrary answer otherwise.\} \] Solutions to the MMPHF problem are in widespread use in both theory and practice. The best upper bound known for the problem encodes \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(DS\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} in $O(n\log\log\log u)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( bits and performs queries in \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}O(\log u)$ time. It has been an open problem to either improve the space upper bound or to show that this somewhat odd looking bound is tight. In this paper, we show the latter: specifically that any data structure (deterministic or randomized) for monotone minimal perfect hashing of any collection of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} elements from a universe of size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(u\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} requires $\Omega(n \cdot \log\log\log\{u\})$ expected bits to answer every query correctly. We achieve our lower bound by defining a graph \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbf\{G\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} where the nodes are the possible \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\{u \choose n\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} inputs and where two nodes are adjacent if they cannot share the same \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(DS\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The size of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(DS\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is then lower bounded by the log of the chromatic number of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbf\{G\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Finally, we show that the fractional chromatic number (and hence the chromatic number) of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbf\{G\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is lower bounded by \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(2^\{\Omega(n \log\log\log u)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
