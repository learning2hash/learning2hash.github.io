The movements of individuals are fundamental to building and maintaining
social connections. This pictorial presents Wanderlust, an experimental
three-dimensional data visualization on the universal visitation pattern
revealed from large-scale mobile phone tracking data. It explores ways of
visualizing recurrent flows and the attractive places they implied. Inspired by
the 19th-century art movement Impressionism, we develop a multi-layered effect,
an impression, of mountains emerging from consolidated flows, to capture the
essence of human journeys and urban spatial structure.
