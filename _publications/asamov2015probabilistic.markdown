In general, the clustering problem is NP-hard, and global optimality cannot
be established for non-trivial instances. For high-dimensional data,
distance-based methods for clustering or classification face an additional
difficulty, the unreliability of distances in very high-dimensional spaces. We
propose a distance-based iterative method for clustering data in very
high-dimensional space, using the \(\ell_1\)-metric that is less sensitive to
high dimensionality than the Euclidean distance. For \(K\) clusters in
\(\mathbb\{R\}^n\), the problem decomposes to \(K\) problems coupled by
probabilities, and an iteration reduces to finding \(Kn\) weighted medians of
points on a line. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the dimension of
the data space, and its performance was observed to improve significantly as
the dimension increases.
