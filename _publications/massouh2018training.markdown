In this thesis we investigate the effect of using web images to build a large
scale database to be used along a deep learning method for a classification
task. We replicate the ImageNet large scale database (ILSVRC-2012) from images
collected from the web using 4 different download strategies varying: the
search engine, the query and the image resolution. As a deep learning method,
we will choose the Convolutional Neural Network that was very successful with
recognition tasks; the AlexNet.
