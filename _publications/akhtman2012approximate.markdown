<p>We devise an analytically simple as well as invertible approximate
expression, which describes the relation between the minimum distance of
a binary code and the corresponding maximum attainable code-rate. For
example, for a rate-(1/4), length-256 binary code the best known bounds
limit the attainable minimum distance to 65&lt;d(n=256,k=64)&lt;90,
while our solution yields d(n=256,k=64)=74.4. The proposed formula
attains the approximation accuracy within the rounding error for ~97% of
(n,k) scenarios, where the exact value of the minimum distance is known.
The results provided may be utilized for the analysis and design of
efficient communication systems.</p>
