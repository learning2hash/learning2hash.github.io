Let \\((X,\S)\\) be a set system on an \\(n\\)-point set \\(X\\). The *discrepancy*
of \\(\S\\) is defined as the minimum of the largest deviation from an even split,
over all subsets of \\(S \in \S\\) and two-colorings \\(\chi\\) on \\(X\\). We consider the
scenario where, for any subset \\(X' \subseteq X\\) of size \\(m \le n\\) and for any
parameter \\(1 \le k \le m\\), the number of restrictions of the sets of \\(\S\\) to
\\(X'\\) of size at most \\(k\\) is only \\(O(m^\{d_1\} k^\{d-d_1\})\\), for fixed integers \\(d
> 0\\) and \\(1 \le d_1 \le d\\) (this generalizes the standard notion of
*bounded primal shatter dimension* when \\(d_1 = d\\)). In this case we show
that there exists a coloring \\(\chi\\) with discrepancy bound \\(O^\{*\}(|S|^\{1/2 -
d_1/(2d)\} n^\{(d_1 - 1)/(2d)\})\\), for each \\(S \in \S\\), where \\(O^\{*\}(\cdot)\\) hides
a polylogarithmic factor in \\(n\\). This bound is tight up to a polylogarithmic
factor \cite\{Mat-95, Mat-99\} and the corresponding coloring \\(\chi\\) can be
computed in expected polynomial time using the very recent machinery of Lovett
and Meka for constructive discrepancy minimization \cite\{LM-12\}. Our bound
improves and generalizes the bounds obtained from the machinery of Har-Peled
and Sharir \cite\{HS-11\} (and the follow-up work in \cite\{SZ-12\}) for points and
halfspaces in \\(d\\)-space for \\(d \ge 3\\).
