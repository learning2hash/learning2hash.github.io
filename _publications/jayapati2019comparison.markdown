Plagiarism is a commonly encountered problem in the academia. While there are
several tools and techniques to efficiently determine plagiarism in text, the
same cannot be said about source code plagiarism. To make the existing systems
more efficient, we use several information retrieval techniques to find the
similarity between source code files written in Java. We later use JPlag, which
is a string-based plagiarism detection tool used in academia to match the
plagiarized source codes. In this paper, we aim to generalize on the efficiency
and effectiveness of detecting plagiarism using different information retrieval
models rather than using just string manipulation algorithms.
