This paper addresses the problem of media retrieval using a multimodal query
(a query which combines visual input with additional semantic information in
natural language feedback). We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which
resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically
generated image that captures semantic information from both image and text
input. We introduce a novel triplet mining method that uses a synthetic image
as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and
target images. We demonstrate that apart from the added value of retrieval
illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user
feedback, the proposed method greatly surpasses other multimodal generation
methods and achieves state of the art results in the multimodal retrieval task.
We also show that in contrast to other retrieval methods, our method provides
explainable embeddings.
