We comprehensively study weighted projective Reed-Muller (WPRM) codes on weighted projective planes \\(\mathbb\{P\}(1,a,b)\\). We provide the universal Gr\"obner basis for the vanishing ideal of the set \\(Y\\) of \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q\\)--rational points of \\(\mathbb\{P\}(1,a,b)\\) to get the dimension of the code. We determine the regularity set of \\(Y\\) using a novel combinatorial approach. We employ footprint techniques to compute the minimum distance.
