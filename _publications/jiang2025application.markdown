Modern high-energy physics (HEP) experiments are increasingly challenged by
the vast size and complexity of their datasets, particularly regarding
large-scale point cloud processing and long sequences. In this study, to
address these challenges, we explore the application of structured state space
models (SSMs), proposing one of the first trials to integrate local-sensitive
hashing into either a hybrid or pure Mamba Model. Our results demonstrate that
pure SSMs could serve as powerful backbones for HEP problems involving tasks
for long sequence data with local inductive bias. By integrating
locality-sensitive hashing into Mamba blocks, we achieve significant
improvements over traditional backbones in key HEP tasks, surpassing them in
inference speed and physics metrics while reducing computational overhead. In
key tests, our approach demonstrated promising results, presenting a viable
alternative to traditional transformer backbones by significantly reducing
FLOPS while maintaining robust performance.
