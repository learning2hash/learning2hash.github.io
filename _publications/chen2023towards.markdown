In this study we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in improving embodied decision-making processes for agents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used due to their advanced reasoning skills and vast world knowledge MLLMs like GPT4-Vision offer enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities. We investigate whether state-of-the-art MLLMs can handle embodied decision-making in an end-to-end manner and whether collaborations between LLMs and MLLMs can enhance decision-making. To address these questions we introduce a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL which evaluates embodied decision-making from the perspectives of Perception Cognition and Action. Additionally we propose HOLMES a multi-agent cooperation framework that allows LLMs to leverage MLLMs and APIs to gather multimodal information for informed decision-making. We compare end-to-end embodied decision-making and HOLMES on our benchmark and find that the GPT4-Vision model demonstrates strong end-to-end embodied decision-making abilities outperforming GPT4-HOLMES in terms of average decision accuracy (+337;). However this performance is exclusive to the latest GPT4-Vision model surpassing the open-source state-of-the-art MLLM by 2637;. Our results indicate that powerful MLLMs like GPT4-Vision hold promise for decision-making in embodied agents offering new avenues for MLLM research.
