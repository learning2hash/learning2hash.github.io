Let \\(\nu\\) be the Furstenberg measure associated with a non-elementary
probability measure \\(\mu\\) on SL_2(R). We show that, when \\(\mu\\) has a finite
second moment, the Fourier coefficients of \\(\nu\\) tend to zero at infinity. In
other words, \\(\nu\\) is a Rajchman measure. This improves a recent result of
Jialun Li.
