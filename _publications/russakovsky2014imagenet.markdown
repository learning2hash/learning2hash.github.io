The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in
object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories
and millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to
present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions.
  This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances
in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the
challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key
breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of
the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object
detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human
accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the five years of the challenge,
and propose future directions and improvements.
