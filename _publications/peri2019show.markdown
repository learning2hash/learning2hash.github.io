Humans have an incredible ability to process and understand information from
multiple sources such as images, video, text, and speech. Recent success of
deep neural networks has enabled us to develop algorithms which give machines
the ability to understand and interpret this information. There is a need to
both broaden their applicability and develop methods which correlate visual
information along with semantic content. We propose a unified model which
jointly trains on images and captions, and learns to generate new captions
given either an image or a caption query. We evaluate our model on three
different tasks namely cross-modal retrieval, image captioning, and sentence
paraphrasing. Our model gains insight into cross-modal vector embeddings,
generalizes well on multiple tasks and is competitive to state of the art
methods on retrieval.
