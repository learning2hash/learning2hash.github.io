Recent work has shown that visual context improves cross-lingual sense
disambiguation for nouns. We extend this line of work to the more challenging
task of cross-lingual verb sense disambiguation, introducing the MultiSense
dataset of 9,504 images annotated with English, German, and Spanish verbs. Each
image in MultiSense is annotated with an English verb and its translation in
German or Spanish. We show that cross-lingual verb sense disambiguation models
benefit from visual context, compared to unimodal baselines. We also show that
the verb sense predicted by our best disambiguation model can improve the
results of a text-only machine translation system when used for a multimodal
translation task.
