Video scene parsing is a long-standing challenging task in computer vision,
aiming to assign pre-defined semantic labels to pixels of all frames in a given
video. Compared with image semantic segmentation, this task pays more attention
on studying how to adopt the temporal information to obtain higher predictive
accuracy. In this report, we introduce our solution for the 1st Video Scene
Parsing in the Wild Challenge, which achieves a mIoU of 57.44 and obtained the
2nd place (our team name is CharlesBLWX).
