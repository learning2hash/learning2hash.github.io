The paper is concerned with the sparse approximation of functions having
hybrid regularity borrowed from the theory of solutions to electronic
Schr\"odinger equations due to Yserentant [43]. We use hyperbolic wavelets to
introduce corresponding new spaces of Besov- and Triebel-Lizorkin-type to
particularly cover the energy norm approximation of functions with dominating
mixed smoothness. Explicit (non-)adaptive algorithms are derived that yield
sharp dimension-independent rates of convergence.
