Wikidata, like Wikipedia, is a knowledge base that anyone can edit. This open
collaboration model is powerful in that it reduces barriers to participation
and allows a large number of people to contribute. However, it exposes the
knowledge base to the risk of vandalism and low-quality contributions. In this
work, we build on past work detecting vandalism in Wikipedia to detect
vandalism in Wikidata. This work is novel in that identifying damaging changes
in a structured knowledge-base requires substantially different feature
engineering work than in a text-based wiki like Wikipedia. We also discuss the
utility of these classifiers for reducing the overall workload of vandalism
patrollers in Wikidata. We describe a machine classification strategy that is
able to catch 89% of vandalism while reducing patrollers' workload by 98%, by
drawing lightly from contextual features of an edit and heavily from the
characteristics of the user making the edit.
