In this paper we propose a novel hash learning approach that has the following main distinguishing features when compared to past frameworks. First the codewords are utilized in the Hamming space as ancillary techniques to accomplish its hash learning task. These codewords which are inferred from the data attempt to capture grouping aspects of the datas hash codes. Furthermore the proposed framework is capable of addressing supervised unsupervised and even semi-supervised hash learning scenarios. Additionally the framework adopts a regularization term over the codewords which automatically chooses the codewords for the problem. To efficiently solve the problem one Block Coordinate Descent algorithm is showcased in the paper. We also show that one step of the algorithms can be casted into several Support Vector Machine problems which enables our algorithms to utilize efficient software package. For the regularization term a closed form solution of the proximal operator is provided in the paper. A series of comparative experiments focused on content-based image retrieval highlights its performance advantages.
