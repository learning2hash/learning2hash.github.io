Automatic image cropping techniques are commonly used to enhance the
aesthetic quality of an image; they do it by detecting the most beautiful or
the most salient parts of the image and removing the unwanted content to have a
smaller image that is more visually pleasing. In this thesis, I introduce an
additional dimension to the problem of cropping, semantics. I argue that image
cropping can also enhance the image's relevancy for a given entity by using the
semantic information contained in the image. I call this problem, Semantic
Image Cropping. To support my argument, I provide a new dataset containing 100
images with at least two different entities per image and four ground truth
croppings collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk. I use this dataset to show
that state-of-the-art cropping algorithms that only take into account
aesthetics do not perform well in the problem of semantic image cropping.
Additionally, I provide a new deep learning system that takes not just
aesthetics but also semantics into account to generate image croppings, and I
evaluate its performance using my new semantic cropping dataset, showing that
using the semantic information of an image can help to produce better
croppings.
