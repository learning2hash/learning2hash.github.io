Clustering is one of the most common unsupervised learning tasks in machine
learning and data mining. Clustering algorithms have been used in a plethora of
applications across several scientific fields. However, there has been limited
research in the clustering of point patterns - sets or multi-sets of unordered
elements - that are found in numerous applications and data sources. In this
paper, we propose two approaches for clustering point patterns. The first is a
non-parametric method based on novel distances for sets. The second is a
model-based approach, formulated via random finite set theory, and solved by
the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the
proposed methods perform well on both simulated and real data.
