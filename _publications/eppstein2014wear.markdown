We study wear-leveling techniques for cuckoo hashing, showing that it is
possible to achieve a memory wear bound of \\(loglog n+O(1)\\) after the
insertion of \\(n\\) items into a table of size \\(Cn\\) for a suitable constant \\(C\\)
using cuckoo hashing. Moreover, we study our cuckoo hashing method empirically,
showing that it significantly improves on the memory wear performance for
classic cuckoo hashing and linear probing in practice.
