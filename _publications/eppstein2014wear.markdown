We study wear-leveling techniques for cuckoo hashing, showing that it is possible to achieve a memory wear bound of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\log\log n+O(1)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} after the insertion of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} items into a table of size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(Cn\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for a suitable constant \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} using cuckoo hashing. Moreover, we study our cuckoo hashing method empirically, showing that it significantly improves on the memory wear performance for classic cuckoo hashing and linear probing in practice.
