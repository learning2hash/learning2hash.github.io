This paper describes the WiLI-2018 benchmark dataset for monolingual written
natural language identification. WiLI-2018 is a publicly available, free of
charge dataset of short text extracts from Wikipedia. It contains 1000
paragraphs of 235 languages, totaling in 23500 paragraphs. WiLI is a
classification dataset: Given an unknown paragraph written in one dominant
language, it has to be decided which language it is.
