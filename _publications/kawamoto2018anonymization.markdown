Obfuscation techniques in location-based services (LBSs) have been shown
useful to hide the concrete locations of service users, whereas they do not
necessarily provide the anonymity. We quantify the anonymity of the location
data obfuscated by the planar Laplacian mechanism and that by the optimal
geo-indistinguishable mechanism of Bordenabe et al. We empirically show that
the latter provides stronger anonymity than the former in the sense that more
users in the database satisfy k-anonymity. To formalize and analyze such
approximate anonymity we introduce the notion of asymptotic anonymity. Then we
show that the location data obfuscated by the optimal geo-indistinguishable
mechanism can be anonymized by removing a smaller number of users from the
database. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal geo-indistinguishable
mechanism has better utility both for users and for data analysts.
