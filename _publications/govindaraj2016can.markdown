Object recognition in images involves identifying objects with partial
occlusions, viewpoint changes, varying illumination, cluttered backgrounds.
Recent work in object recognition uses machine learning techniques SVM-KNN,
Local Ensemble Kernel Learning, Multiple Kernel Learning. In this paper, we
want to utilize SVM as week learners in AdaBoost. Experiments are done with
classifiers like near- est neighbor, k-nearest neighbor, Support vector
machines, Local learning(SVM- KNN) and AdaBoost. Models use Scale-Invariant
descriptors and Pyramid his- togram of gradient descriptors. AdaBoost is
trained with set of week classifier as SVMs, each with kernel distance function
on different descriptors. Results shows AdaBoost with SVM outperform other
methods for Object Categorization dataset.
