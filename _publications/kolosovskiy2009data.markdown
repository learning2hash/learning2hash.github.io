In this article we discuss a data structure which combines advantages of two different ways for representing graphs adjacency matrix and collection of adjacency lists. This data structure can fast add and search edges (advantages of adjacency matrix) use linear amount of memory let to obtain adjacency list for certain vertex (advantages of collection of adjacency lists). Basic knowledge of linked lists and hash tables is required to understand this article. The article contains examples of implementation on Java.
