At a time when the influence of generative Artificial Intelligence on visual
arts is a highly debated topic, we raise the attention towards a more subtle
phenomenon: the algorithmic censorship of artistic nudity online. We analyze
the performance of three "Not-Safe-For-Work'' image classifiers on artistic
nudity, and empirically uncover the existence of a gender and a stylistic bias,
as well as evident technical limitations, especially when only considering
visual information. Hence, we propose a multi-modal zero-shot classification
approach that improves artistic nudity classification. From our research, we
draw several implications that we hope will inform future research on this
topic.
