We present a Visual Place Recognition system that follows the two-stage
format common to image retrieval pipelines. The system encodes images of places
by employing the activations of different layers of a pre-trained,
off-the-shelf, VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. In the
first stage of our method and given a query image of a place, a number of top
candidate images is retrieved from a previously stored database of places. In
the second stage, we propose an exhaustive comparison of the query image
against these candidates by encoding semantic and spatial information in the
form of CNN features. Results from our approach outperform by a large margin
state-of-the-art visual place recognition methods on five of the most commonly
used benchmark datasets. The performance gain is especially remarkable on the
most challenging datasets, with more than a twofold recognition improvement
with respect to the latest published work.
