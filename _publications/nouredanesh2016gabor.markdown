In recent years, advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence of
massive databases, containing images from a diverse range of modalities. This
has significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images on
one side, and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systems
on the other side. Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as a
potential vehicle to achieve these goals. One of the recently introduced binary
descriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes (RBCs) that are
driven from Radon transform via local thresholding. Gabor transform is also a
powerful transform to extract texture-based information. Gabor features have
exhibited robustness against rotation, scale, and also photometric
disturbances, such as illumination changes and image noise in many
applications. This paper introduces Gabor Barcodes (GBCs), as a novel framework
for the image annotation. To find the most discriminative GBC for a given query
image, the effects of employing Gabor filters with different parameters, i.e.,
different sets of scales and orientations, are investigated, resulting in
different barcode lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method has
been evaluated on the IRMA dataset with 193 classes comprising of 12,677 x-ray
images for indexing, and 1,733 x-rays images for testing. A total error score
as low as \(351\) (\(\approx 80%\) accuracy for the first hit) was achieved.
