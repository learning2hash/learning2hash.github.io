Kurdish is written in different scripts. The two most popular scripts are
Latin and Persian-Arabic. However, not all Kurdish readers are familiar with
both mentioned scripts that could be resolved by automatic transliterators. So
far, the developed tools mostly transliterate Persian-Arabic scripts into
Latin. We present a transliterator to transliterate Kurdish texts in Latin into
Persian-Arabic script. We also discuss the issues that should be considered in
the transliteration process. The tool is a part of Kurdish BLARK, and it is
publicly available for non-commercial use
