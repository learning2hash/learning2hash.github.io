<p>Similarity search is an important problem in information retrieval.
This similarity is based on a distance. Symbolic representation of time
series has attracted many researchers recently, since it reduces the
dimensionality of these high dimensional data objects. We propose a new
distance metric that is applied to symbolic data objects and we test it
on time series data bases in a classification task. We compare it to
other distances that are well known in the literature for symbolic data
objects. We also prove, mathematically, that our distance is metric.</p>
