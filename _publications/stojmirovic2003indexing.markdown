We propose a family of very efficient hierarchical indexing schemes for
ungapped, score matrix-based similarity search in large datasets of short (4-12
amino acid) protein fragments. This type of similarity search has importance in
both providing a building block to more complex algorithms and for possible use
in direct biological investigations where datasets are of the order of 60
million objects. Our scheme is based on the internal geometry of the amino acid
alphabet and performs exceptionally well, for example outputting 100 nearest
neighbours to any possible fragment of length 10 after scanning on average less
than one per cent of the entire dataset.
