In the early days, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) was studied with
global features. Since 2003, image retrieval based on local descriptors (de
facto SIFT) has been extensively studied for over a decade due to the advantage
of SIFT in dealing with image transformations. Recently, image representations
based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing
interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this
time of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of
instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories, SIFT-based and
CNN-based methods, are presented. For the former, according to the codebook
size, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks.
For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained or
fine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass
of an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-based
feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance
retrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories,
and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods.
After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories on
several datasets, we discuss promising directions towards generic and
specialized instance retrieval.
