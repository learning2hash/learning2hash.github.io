Relative attributes indicate the strength of a particular attribute between
image pairs. We introduce a deep Siamese network with rank SVM loss function,
called Deep Rank SVM (DRSVM), in order to decide which one of a pair of images
has a stronger presence of a specific attribute. The network is trained in an
end-to-end fashion to jointly learn the visual features and the ranking
function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the
state-of-the-art methods on four image benchmark datasets: LFW-10, PubFig,
UTZap50K-lexi and UTZap50K-2 datasets. DRSVM surpasses state-of-art in terms of
the average accuracy across attributes, on three of the four image benchmark
datasets.
