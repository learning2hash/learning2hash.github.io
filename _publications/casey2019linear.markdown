For any finite point set in \\(D\\)-dimensional space equipped with the 1-norm,
we present random linear embeddings to \\(k\\)-dimensional space, with a new
metric, having the following properties. For any pair of points from the point
set that are not too close, the distance between their images is a strictly
concave increasing function of their original distance, up to multiplicative
error. The target dimension \\(k\\) need only be quadratic in the logarithm of the
size of the point set to ensure the result holds with high probability. The
linear embeddings are random matrices composed of standard Cauchy random
variables, and the proofs rely on Chernoff bounds for sums of iid random
variables. The new metric is translation invariant, but is not induced by a
norm.
