This paper functions as a tutorial for individuals interested to enter the
field of information retrieval but wouldn't know where to begin from. It
describes two fundamental yet efficient image retrieval techniques, the first
being k - nearest neighbors (knn) and the second support vector machines(svm).
The goal is to provide the reader with both the theoretical and practical
aspects in order to acquire a better understanding. Along with this tutorial we
have also developed the equivalent software1 using the MATLAB environment in
order to illustrate the techniques, so that the reader can have a hands-on
experience.
