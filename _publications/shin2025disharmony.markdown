Content generation and manipulation approaches based on deep learning methods
have seen significant advancements, leading to an increased need for techniques
to detect whether an image has been generated or edited. Another area of
research focuses on the insertion and harmonization of objects within images.
In this study, we explore the potential of using harmonization data in
conjunction with a segmentation model to enhance the detection of edited image
regions. These edits can be either manually crafted or generated using deep
learning methods. Our findings demonstrate that this approach can effectively
identify such edits. Existing forensic models often overlook the detection of
harmonized objects in relation to the background, but our proposed Disharmony
Network addresses this gap. By utilizing an aggregated dataset of harmonization
techniques, our model outperforms existing forensic networks in identifying
harmonized objects integrated into their backgrounds, and shows potential for
detecting various forms of edits, including virtual try-on tasks.
