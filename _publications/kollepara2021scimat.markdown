In this work, we announce a comprehensive well curated and opensource dataset
with millions of samples for pre-college and college level problems in
mathematicsand science. A preliminary set of results using transformer
architecture with character to character encoding is shown. The dataset
identifies some challenging problem and invites research on better architecture
