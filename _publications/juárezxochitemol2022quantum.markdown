Let \(S_1, S_2 \in \Sigma^*\) strings, we say that \(S_1\) \{\em jumble match\}
\(S_2\) if they are permutations of each other. Given a text \(T\) of size \(N\) and
a string \(S \in \Sigma^*\), the problem of *Jumbled Pattern Matching* (JPM)
is to determine all substrings in \(T\) jumbled matching \(S\). In classical
computing, a widespread conjecture is that JPM requires
\(Ω(N^\{2-\epsilon\})\) preprocessing time and space for \(O(1)\) query time, or
\(Ω(N^\{1-\delta\})\) query time in the online version, with \(\epsilon, \delta
>0\). In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for the online JPM in
\(O(\sqrt\{N\})\) time.
