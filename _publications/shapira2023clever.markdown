The escalating debate on AIs capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine intelligence. Recently many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples limited benchmark testing and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.
