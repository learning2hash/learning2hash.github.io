In this paper we present a data visualization method together with its
potential usefulness in digital humanities and philosophy of language. We
compile a multilingual parallel corpus from different versions of
Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, including the original in German
and translations into English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Using this corpus,
we compute a similarity measure between propositions and render a visual
network of relations for different languages.
