The paper introduces a new method for discrimination of documents given in
different scripts. The document is mapped into a uniformly coded text of
numerical values. It is derived from the position of the letters in the text
line, based on their typographical characteristics. Each code is considered as
a gray level. Accordingly, the coded text determines a 1-D image, on which
texture analysis by run-length statistics and local binary pattern is
performed. It defines feature vectors representing the script content of the
document. A modified clustering approach employed on document feature vector
groups documents written in the same script. Experimentation performed on two
custom oriented databases of historical documents in old Cyrillic, angular and
round Glagolitic as well as Antiqua and Fraktur scripts demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed method with respect to well-known methods in the
state-of-the-art.
