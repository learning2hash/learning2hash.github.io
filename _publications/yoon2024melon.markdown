Monitoring and managing the growth and quality of fruits are very important
tasks. To effectively train deep learning models like YOLO for real-time fruit
detection, high-quality image datasets are essential. However, such datasets
are often lacking in agriculture. Generative AI models can help create
high-quality images. In this study, we used MidJourney and Firefly tools to
generate images of melon greenhouses and post-harvest fruits through
text-to-image, pre-harvest image-to-image, and post-harvest image-to-image
methods. We evaluated these AIgenerated images using PSNR and SSIM metrics and
tested the detection performance of the YOLOv9 model. We also assessed the net
quality of real and generated fruits. Our results showed that generative AI
could produce images very similar to real ones, especially for post-harvest
fruits. The YOLOv9 model detected the generated images well, and the net
quality was also measurable. This shows that generative AI can create realistic
images useful for fruit detection and quality assessment, indicating its great
potential in agriculture. This study highlights the potential of AI-generated
images for data augmentation in melon fruit detection and quality assessment
and envisions a positive future for generative AI applications in agriculture.
