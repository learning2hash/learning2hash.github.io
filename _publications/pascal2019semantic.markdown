In recent years, representation learning approaches have disrupted many
multimedia computing tasks. Among those approaches, deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have notably reached human level expertise on some constrained
image classification tasks. Nonetheless, training CNNs from scratch for new
task or simply new data turns out to be complex and time-consuming. Recently,
transfer learning has emerged as an effective methodology for adapting
pre-trained CNNs to new data and classes, by only retraining the last
classification layer. This paper focuses on improving this process, in order to
better transfer knowledge between CNN architectures for faster trainings in the
case of fine tuning for image classification. This is achieved by combining and
transfering supplementary weights, based on similarity considerations between
source and target classes. The study includes a comparison between semantic and
content-based similarities, and highlights increased initial performances and
training speed, along with superior long term performances when limited
training samples are available.
