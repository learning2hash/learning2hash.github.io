Content based image retrieval, a technique which uses visual contents of image
to search images from large scale image databases according to users' interests.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent technology used in the area
of content based face image retrieval. Nowadays digital devices and photo
sharing sites are getting more popularity, large human face photos are available
in database. Multiple types of facial features are used to represent
discriminality on large scale human facial image database. Searching and mining
of facial images are challenging problems and important research issues. Sparse
representation on features provides significant improvement in indexing related
images to query image.
