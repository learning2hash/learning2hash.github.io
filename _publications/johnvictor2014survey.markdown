Content based image retrieval, a technique which uses visual contents of
image to search images from large scale image databases according to users'
interests. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent technology used
in the area of content based face image retrieval. Nowadays digital devices and
photo sharing sites are getting more popularity, large human face photos are
available in database. Multiple types of facial features are used to represent
discriminality on large scale human facial image database. Searching and mining
of facial images are challenging problems and important research issues. Sparse
representation on features provides significant improvement in indexing related
images to query image.
