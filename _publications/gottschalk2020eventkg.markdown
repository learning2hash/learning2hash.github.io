Research on notable accomplishments and important events in the life of
people of public interest usually requires close reading of long encyclopedic
or biographical sources, which is a tedious and time-consuming task. Whereas
semantic reference sources, such as the EventKG knowledge graph, provide
structured representations of relevant facts, they often include hundreds of
events and temporal relations for particular entities. In this paper, we
present EventKG+BT - a timeline generation system that creates concise and
interactive spatio-temporal representations of biographies from a knowledge
graph using distant supervision.
