In this paper, we discuss a method for identifying a seed word that would
best represent a class of named entities in a graphical representation of words
and their similarities. Word networks, or word graphs, are representations of
vectorized text where nodes are the words encountered in a corpus, and the
weighted edges incident on the nodes represent how similar the words are to
each other. We intend to build a bilingual word graph and identify seed words
through community analysis that would be best used to segment a graph according
to its named entities, therefore providing an unsupervised way of tagging named
entities for a bilingual language base.
