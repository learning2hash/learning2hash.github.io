Data catalogs serve as repositories for organizing and accessing diverse
collection of data assets, but their effectiveness hinges on the ease with
which business users can look-up relevant content. Unfortunately, many data
catalogs within organizations suffer from limited searchability due to
inadequate metadata like asset descriptions. Hence, there is a need of content
generation solution to enrich and curate metadata in a scalable way. This paper
explores the challenges associated with metadata creation and proposes a unique
prompt enrichment idea of leveraging existing metadata content using retrieval
based few-shot technique tied with generative large language models (LLM). The
literature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the
behavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-\`a-vis few-shot
finetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy,
factual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80%
Rouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances
accepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically
generating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the
research attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to
effectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly
improving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.
