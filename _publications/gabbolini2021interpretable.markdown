We introduce a novel and interpretable path-based music similarity measure.
Our similarity measure assumes that items, such as songs and artists, and
information about those items are represented in a knowledge graph. We find
paths in the graph between a seed and a target item; we score those paths based
on their interestingness; and we aggregate those scores to determine the
similarity between the seed and the target. A distinguishing feature of our
similarity measure is its interpretability. In particular, we can translate the
most interesting paths into natural language, so that the causes of the
similarity judgements can be readily understood by humans. We compare the
accuracy of our similarity measure with other competitive path-based similarity
baselines in two experimental settings and with four datasets. The results
highlight the validity of our approach to music similarity, and demonstrate
that path interestingness scores can be the basis of an accurate and
interpretable similarity measure.
