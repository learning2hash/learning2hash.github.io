This paper addresses the nearest neighbor search problem under inner product similarity and introduces a compact code-based approach. The idea is to approximate a vector using the composition of several elements selected from a source dictionary and to represent this vector by a short code composed of the indices of the selected elements. The inner product between a query vector and a database vector is efficiently estimated from the query vector and the short code of the database vector. We show the superior performance of the proposed group \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(M\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-selection algorithm that selects \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(M\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} elements from \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(M\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} source dictionaries for vector approximation in terms of search accuracy and efficiency for compact codes of the same length via theoretical and empirical analysis. Experimental results on large-scale datasets (\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1M\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1B\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} SIFT features, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1M\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} linear models and Netflix) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
