We study (symbol-pair) codes for symbol-pair read channels introduced
recently by Cassuto and Blaum (2010). A Singleton-type bound on symbol-pair
codes is established and infinite families of optimal symbol-pair codes are
constructed. These codes are maximum distance separable (MDS) in the sense that
they meet the Singleton-type bound. In contrast to classical codes, where all
known q-ary MDS codes have length O(q), we show that q-ary MDS symbol-pair
codes can have length Î©(q^2). In addition, we completely determine the
existence of MDS symbol-pair codes for certain parameters.
