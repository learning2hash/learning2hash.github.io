Named entities recognition (NER) and disambiguation (NED) can add semantic
context to the recognized named entities in texts. Named entity linkage in
texts, regardless of a domain, provides links between the entities mentioned in
unstructured texts and individual instances of real-world objects. In this
poster, we present a tool - protagonistTagger - for person NER and NED in
texts. The tool was tested on texts extracted from classic English novels and
Polish Internet news. The tool's performance (both precision and recall)
fluctuates between 78% and even 88%.
