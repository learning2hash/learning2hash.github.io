We present a new and simple randomized algorithm for constructing the
Delaunay triangulation using nearest neighbor graphs for point location. Under
suitable assumptions, it runs in linear expected time for points in the plane
with polynomially bounded spread, i.e., if the ratio between the largest and
smallest pointwise distance is polynomially bounded. This also holds for point
sets with bounded spread in higher dimensions as long as the expected
complexity of the Delaunay triangulation of a sample of the points is linear in
the sample size.
