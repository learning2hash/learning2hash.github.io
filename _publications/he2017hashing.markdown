<p>Hashing, or learning binary embeddings of data, is frequently used in
nearest neighbor retrieval. In this paper, we develop learning to rank
formulations for hashing, aimed at directly optimizing ranking-based
evaluation metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). We first observe that the
integer-valued Hamming distance often leads to tied rankings, and
propose to use tie-aware versions of AP and NDCG to evaluate hashing for
retrieval. Then, to optimize tie-aware ranking metrics, we derive their
continuous relaxations, and perform gradient-based optimization with
deep neural networks. Our results establish the new state-of-the-art for
image retrieval by Hamming ranking in common benchmarks.</p>
