Hashing or learning binary embeddings of data is frequently used in nearest neighbor retrieval. In this paper we develop learning to rank formulations for hashing aimed at directly optimizing ranking45;based evaluation metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). We first observe that the integer45;valued Hamming distance often leads to tied rankings and propose to use tie45;aware versions of AP and NDCG to evaluate hashing for retrieval. Then to optimize tie45;aware ranking metrics we derive their continuous relaxations and perform gradient45;based optimization with deep neural networks. Our results establish the new state45;of45;the45;art for image retrieval by Hamming ranking in common benchmarks.
