We introduce a new sorting algorithm that is the combination of ML-enhanced
sorting with the In-place Super Scalar Sample Sort (IPS4o). The main
contribution of our work is to achieve parallel ML-enhanced sorting, as
previous algorithms were limited to sequential implementations. We introduce
the In-Place Parallel Learned Sort (IPLS) algorithm and compare it extensively
against other sorting approaches. IPLS combines the IPS4o framework with linear
models trained using the Fastest Minimum Conflict Degree algorithm to partition
data. The experimental results do not crown IPLS as the fastest algorithm.
However, they do show that IPLS is competitive among its peers and that using
the IPS4o framework is a promising approach towards parallel learned sorting.
