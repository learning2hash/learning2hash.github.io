The asymptotic rate vs. distance problem is a long-standing fundamental
problem in coding theory. The best upper bound to date was given in 1977 and
has received since then numerous proofs and interpretations. Here we provide a
new, elementary proof of this bound based on counting walks in the Hamming
cube.
