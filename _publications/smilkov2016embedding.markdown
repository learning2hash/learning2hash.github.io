Embeddings are ubiquitous in machine learning, appearing in recommender
systems, NLP, and many other applications. Researchers and developers often
need to explore the properties of a specific embedding, and one way to analyze
embeddings is to visualize them. We present the Embedding Projector, a tool for
interactive visualization and interpretation of embeddings.
