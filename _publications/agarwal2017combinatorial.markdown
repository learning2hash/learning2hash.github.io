Locally recoverable (LRC) codes have recently been a focus point of research
in coding theory due to their theoretical appeal and applications in
distributed storage systems. In an LRC code, any erased symbol of a codeword
can be recovered by accessing only a small number of other symbols. For LRC
codes over a small alphabet (such as binary), the optimal rate-distance
trade-off is unknown. We present several new combinatorial bounds on LRC codes
including the locality-aware sphere packing and Plotkin bounds. We also develop
an approach to linear programming (LP) bounds on LRC codes. The resulting LP
bound gives better estimates in examples than the other upper bounds known in
the literature. Further, we provide the tightest known upper bound on the rate
of linear LRC codes with a given relative distance, an improvement over the
previous best known bounds.
