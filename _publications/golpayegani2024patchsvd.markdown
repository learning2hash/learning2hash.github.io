Storing data is particularly a challenge when dealing with image data which
often involves large file sizes due to the high resolution and complexity of
images. Efficient image compression algorithms are crucial to better manage
data storage costs. In this paper, we propose a novel region-based lossy image
compression technique, called PatchSVD, based on the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. We show through experiments that PatchSVD
outperforms SVD-based image compression with respect to three popular image
compression metrics. Moreover, we compare PatchSVD compression artifacts with
those of Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and SVD-based image
compression and illustrate some cases where PatchSVD compression artifacts are
preferable compared to JPEG and SVD artifacts.
