The explosive growth of multimedia content in the digital economy era has
brought challenges in content recognition, copyright protection, and data
management. As an emerging content management technology, perceptual hash-based
digital fingerprints, serving as compact summaries of multimedia content, have
been widely adopted for efficient multimedia content identification and
retrieval across different modalities (e.g., text, image, video, audio),
attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite the
increasing applications of digital fingerprints, there is a lack of systematic
and comprehensive literature review on multimedia digital fingerprints. This
survey aims to fill this gap and provide an important resource for researchers
studying the details and related advancements of multimedia digital
fingerprints. The survey first introduces the definition, characteristics, and
related concepts (including hash functions, granularity, similarity measures,
etc.) of digital fingerprints. It then focuses on analyzing and summarizing the
algorithms for extracting unimodal fingerprints of different types of digital
content, including text fingerprints, image fingerprints, video fingerprints,
and audio fingerprints. Particularly, it provides an in-depth review and
summary of deep learning-based fingerprints. Additionally, the survey
elaborates on the various practical applications of digital fingerprints and
outlines the challenges and potential future research directions. The goal is
to promote the continued development of multimedia digital fingerprint
research.
