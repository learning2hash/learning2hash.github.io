<p>This paper constitutes an extension to the report on DISA-MU team
participation in the ImageCLEF 2014 Scalable Concept Image Annotation
Task as published in [3]. Specifically, we introduce a new similarity
search component that was implemented into the system, report on the
results achieved by utilizing this component, and analyze the influence
of different similarity search parameters on the annotation quality.</p>
