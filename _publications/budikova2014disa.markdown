This paper constitutes an extension to the report on DISA-MU team
participation in the ImageCLEF 2014 Scalable Concept Image Annotation Task as
published in [3]. Specifically, we introduce a new similarity search component
that was implemented into the system, report on the results achieved by
utilizing this component, and analyze the influence of different similarity
search parameters on the annotation quality.
