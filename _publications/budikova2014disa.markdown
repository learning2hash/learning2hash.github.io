This paper constitutes an extension to the report on DISA-MU team participation in the ImageCLEF 2014 Scalable Concept Image Annotation Task as published in 3. Specifically we introduce a new similarity search component that was implemented into the system report on the results achieved by utilizing this component and analyze the influence of different similarity search parameters on the annotation quality.
