Timely prediction of clinically critical events in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
is important for improving care and survival rate. Most of the existing
approaches are based on the application of various classification methods on
explicitly extracted statistical features from vital signals. In this work, we
propose to eliminate the high cost of engineering hand-crafted features from
multivariate time-series of physiologic signals by learning their
representation with a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder. We then propose to
hash the learned representations to enable signal similarity assessment for the
prediction of critical events. We apply this methodological framework to
predict Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) on a large and diverse dataset of
vital signal recordings. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the presented
framework in accurately predicting an upcoming AHE.
