This paper presents a new alphabet-dependent bound for codes with
hierarchical locality. Then, the complete list of possible localities is
derived for a class of codes obtained by deleting specific columns from a
Simplex code. This list is used to show that these codes are optimal codes with
hierarchical locality.
