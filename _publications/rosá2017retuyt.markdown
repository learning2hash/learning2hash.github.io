This article presents classifiers based on SVM and Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) for the TASS 2017 challenge on tweets sentiment analysis. The
classifier with the best performance in general uses a combination of SVM and
CNN. The use of word embeddings was particularly useful for improving the
classifiers performance.
