Image hashing is a popular technique applied to large scale content-based visual
retrieval due to its compact and efficient binary codes. Our work proposes a new
end-to-end deep network architecture for supervised hashing which directly
learns binary codes from input images and maintains good properties over binary
codes such as similarity preservation, independence, and balancing. Furthermore,
we also propose a new learning scheme that can cope with the binary constrained
loss function. The proposed algorithm not only is scalable for learning over
large-scale datasets but also outperforms state-of-the-art supervised hashing
methods, which are illustrated throughout extensive experiments from various
image retrieval benchmarks.
