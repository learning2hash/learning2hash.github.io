Distance covariance is a measure of dependence between two random variables
that take values in two, in general different, metric spaces, see Sz\'ekely,
Rizzo and Bakirov (2007) and Lyons (2013). It is known that the distance
covariance, and its generalization \\(\alpha\\)-distance covariance, can be defined
in several different ways that are equivalent under some moment conditions. The
present paper considers four such definitions and find minimal moment
conditions for each of them, together with some partial results when these
conditions are not satisfied.
  The paper also studies the special case when the variables are Hilbert space
valued, and shows under weak moment conditions that two such variables are
independent if and only if their (\\(\alpha\\)-)distance covariance is 0; this
extends results by Lyons (2013) and Dehling et al. (2018+). The proof uses a
new definition of distance covariance in the Hilbert space case, generalizing
the definition for Euclidean spaces using characteristic functions by
Sz\'ekely, Rizzo and Bakirov (2007).
