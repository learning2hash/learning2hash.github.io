Many computational social science projects examine online discourse
surrounding a specific trending topic. These works often involve the
acquisition of large-scale corpora relevant to the event in question to analyze
aspects of the response to the event. Keyword searches present a
precision-recall trade-off and crowd-sourced annotations, while effective, are
costly. This work aims to enable automatic and accurate ad-hoc retrieval of
comments discussing a trending topic from a large corpus, using only a handful
of seed news articles.
