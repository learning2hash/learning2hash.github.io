In recent years, several real-time or near real-time object detectors have
been developed. However these object detectors are typically designed for
first-person view images where the subject is large in the image and do not
directly apply well to detecting vehicles in aerial imagery. Though some
detectors have been developed for aerial imagery, these are either slow or do
not handle multi-scale imagery very well. Here the popular YOLOv2 detector is
modified to vastly improve it's performance on aerial data. The modified
detector is compared to Faster RCNN on several aerial imagery datasets. The
proposed detector gives near state of the art performance at more than 4x the
speed.
