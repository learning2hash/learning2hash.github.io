Object detection has always been practical. There are so many things in our
world that recognizing them can not only increase our automatic knowledge of
the surroundings, but can also be lucrative for those interested in starting a
new business. One of these attractive objects is the license plate (LP). In
addition to the security uses that license plate detection can have, it can
also be used to create creative businesses. With the development of object
detection methods based on deep learning models, an appropriate and
comprehensive dataset becomes doubly important. But due to the frequent
commercial use of license plate datasets, there are limited datasets not only
in Iran but also in the world. The largest Iranian dataset for detection
license plates has 1,466 images. Also, the largest Iranian dataset for
recognizing the characters of a license plate has 5,000 images. We have
prepared a complete dataset including 20,967 car images along with all the
detection annotation of the whole license plate and its characters, which can
be useful for various purposes. Also, the total number of license plate images
for character recognition application is 27,745 images.
