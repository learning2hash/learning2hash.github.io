Detecting semantic similarities between sentences is still a challenge today
due to the ambiguity of natural languages. In this work, we propose a simple
approach to identifying semantically similar questions by combining the
strengths of word embeddings and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In
addition, we demonstrate how the cosine similarity metric can be used to
effectively compare feature vectors. Our network is trained on the Quora
dataset, which contains over 400k question pairs. We experiment with different
embedding approaches such as Word2Vec, Fasttext, and Doc2Vec and investigate
the effects these approaches have on model performance. Our model achieves
competitive results on the Quora dataset and complements the well-established
evidence that CNNs can be utilized for paraphrase detection tasks.
