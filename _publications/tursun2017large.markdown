Trademark retrieval (TR) has become an important yet challenging problem due
to an ever increasing trend in trademark applications and infringement
incidents. There have been many promising attempts for the TR problem, which,
however, fell impracticable since they were evaluated with limited and mostly
trivial datasets. In this paper, we provide a large-scale dataset with
benchmark queries with which different TR approaches can be evaluated
systematically. Moreover, we provide a baseline on this benchmark using the
widely-used methods applied to TR in the literature. Furthermore, we identify
and correct two important issues in TR approaches that were not addressed
before: reversal of contrast, and presence of irrelevant text in trademarks
severely affect the TR methods. Lastly, we applied deep learning, namely,
several popular Convolutional Neural Network models, to the TR problem. To the
best of the authors, this is the first attempt to do so.
