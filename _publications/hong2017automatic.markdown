We designed a gangue sorting system,and built a convolutional neural network
model based on AlexNet. Data enhancement and transfer learning are used to
solve the problem which the convolution neural network has insufficient
training data in the training stage. An object detection and region clipping
algorithm is proposed to adjust the training image data to the optimum size.
Compared with traditional neural network and SVM algorithm, this algorithm has
higher recognition rate for coal and coal gangue, and provides important
reference for identification and separation of coal and gangue.
