Similarity45;preserving hashing is a widely45;used method for nearest neighbour search in large45;scale image retrieval tasks. There has been considerable research on generating efficient image representation via the deep45;network45;based hashing methods. However the issue of efficient searching in the deep representation space remains largely unsolved. To this end we propose a simple yet efficient deep45;network45;based multi45;index hashing method for simultaneously learning the powerful image representation and the efficient searching. To achieve these two goals we introduce the multi45;index hashing (MIH) mechanism into the proposed deep architecture which divides the binary codes into multiple substrings. Due to the non45;uniformly distributed codes will result in inefficiency searching we add the two balanced constraints at feature45;level and instance45;level respectively. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image retrieval datasets show that the learned balanced binary codes bring dramatic speedups and achieve comparable performance over the existing baselines.
