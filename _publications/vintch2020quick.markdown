Recommending playlists to users in the context of a digital music service is
a difficult task because a playlist is often more than the mere sum of its
parts. We present a novel method for generating playlist embeddings that are
invariant to playlist length and sensitive to local and global track ordering.
The embeddings also capture information about playlist sequencing, and are
enriched with side information about the playlist user. We show that these
embeddings are useful for generating next-best playlist recommendations, and
that side information can be used for the cold start problem.
