WTA (Winner Take All) hashing has been successfully applied in many large
scale vision applications. This hashing scheme was tailored to take advantage
of the comparative reasoning (or order based information), which showed
significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we identify a subtle issue
with WTA, which grows with the sparsity of the datasets. This issue limits the
discriminative power of WTA. We then propose a solution for this problem based
on the idea of Densification which provably fixes the issue. Our experiments
show that Densified WTA Hashing outperforms Vanilla WTA both in image
classification and retrieval tasks consistently and significantly.
