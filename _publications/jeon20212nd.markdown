This paper presents the 2nd place solution to the Facebook AI Image
Similarity Challenge : Matching Track on DrivenData. The solution is based on
self-supervised learning, and Vision Transformer(ViT). The main breaktrough
comes from concatenating query and reference image to form as one image and
asking ViT to directly predict from the image if query image used reference
image. The solution scored 0.8291 Micro-average Precision on the private
leaderboard.
