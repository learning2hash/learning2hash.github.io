We present a new algorithm for dynamic prefix-free coding, based on Shannon
coding. We give a simple analysis and prove a better upper bound on the length
of the encoding produced than the corresponding bound for dynamic Huffman
coding. We show how our algorithm can be modified for efficient
length-restricted coding, alphabetic coding and coding with unequal letter
costs.
