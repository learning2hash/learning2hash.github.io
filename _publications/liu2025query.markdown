In this work, we address the brand entity linking problem for e-commerce
search queries. The entity linking task is done by either i)a two-stage process
consisting of entity mention detection followed by entity disambiguation or ii)
an end-to-end linking approaches that directly fetch the target entity given
the input text. The task presents unique challenges: queries are extremely
short (averaging 2.4 words), lack natural language structure, and must handle a
massive space of unique brands. We present a two-stage approach combining
named-entity recognition with matching, and a novel end-to-end solution using
extreme multi-class classification. We validate our solutions by both offline
benchmarks and the impact of online A/B test.
