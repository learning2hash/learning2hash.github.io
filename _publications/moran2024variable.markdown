We introduce a scheme for optimally allocating a variable number of bits per LSH hyperplane. Previous approaches assign a constant number of bits per hyperplane. This neglects the fact that a subset of hyperplanes may be more informative than others. Our method dubbed Variable Bit Quantisation (VBQ) provides a datadriven non-uniform bit allocation across hyperplanes. Despite only using a fraction of the available hyperplanes VBQ outperforms uniform quantisation by up to 16837; for retrieval across standard text and image datasets.
