We prove the strong convergence of the spectrum of the kinetic Brownian
motion to the spectrum of base Laplacian for a large class of compact locally
Riemannian homogeneous spaces, in particular all compact locally symmetric
spaces. This generalizes recent work of Kolb--Weich--Wolf [arXiv:2011.06434] on
constant curvature surfaces.
