Heyde proved that a Gaussian distribution on a real line is characterized by
the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form given another.
The present article is devoted to an analog of the Heyde theorem in the case
when random variables take values in a locally compact Abelian group and the
coefficients of the linear forms are integers.
