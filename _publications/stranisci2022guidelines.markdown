Despite biographies are widely spread within the Semantic Web, resources and
approaches to automatically extract biographical events are limited. Such
limitation reduces the amount of structured, machine-readable biographical
information, especially about people belonging to underrepresented groups. Our
work challenges this limitation by providing a set of guidelines for the
semantic annotation of life events. The guidelines are designed to be
interoperable with existing ISO-standards for semantic annotation: ISO-TimeML
(ISO-24617-1), and SemAF (ISO-24617-4). Guidelines were tested through an
annotation task of Wikipedia biographies of underrepresented writers, namely
authors born in non-Western countries, migrants, or belonging to ethnic
minorities. 1,000 sentences were annotated by 4 annotators with an average
Inter-Annotator Agreement of 0.825. The resulting corpus was mapped on
OntoNotes. Such mapping allowed to to expand our corpus, showing that already
existing resources may be exploited for the biographical event extraction task.
