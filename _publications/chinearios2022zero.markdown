Author profiling classifies author characteristics by analyzing how language
is shared among people. In this work, we study that task from a low-resource
viewpoint: using little or no training data. We explore different zero and
few-shot models based on entailment and evaluate our systems on several
profiling tasks in Spanish and English. In addition, we study the effect of
both the entailment hypothesis and the size of the few-shot training sample. We
find that entailment-based models out-perform supervised text classifiers based
on roberta-XLM and that we can reach 80% of the accuracy of previous approaches
using less than 50% of the training data on average.
