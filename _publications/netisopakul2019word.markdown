Distributional semantics in the form of word embeddings are an essential
ingredient to many modern natural language processing systems. The
quantification of semantic similarity between words can be used to evaluate the
ability of a system to perform semantic interpretation. To this end, a number
of word similarity datasets have been created for the English language over the
last decades. For Thai language few such resources are available. In this work,
we create three Thai word similarity datasets by translating and re-rating the
popular WordSim-353, SimLex-999 and SemEval-2017-Task-2 datasets. The three
datasets contain 1852 word pairs in total and have different characteristics in
terms of difficulty, domain coverage, and notion of similarity (relatedness
vs.~similarity). These features help to gain a broader picture of the
properties of an evaluated word embedding model. We include baseline
evaluations with existing Thai embedding models, and identify the high ratio of
out-of-vocabulary words as one of the biggest challenges. All datasets,
evaluation results, and a tool for easy evaluation of new Thai embedding models
are available to the NLP community online.
