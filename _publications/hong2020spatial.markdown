In recent years, hyperspectral imaging, also known as imaging spectroscopy,
has been paid an increasing interest in geoscience and remote sensing
community. Hyperspectral imagery is characterized by very rich spectral
information, which enables us to recognize the materials of interest lying on
the surface of the Earth more easier. We have to admit, however, that high
spectral dimension inevitably brings some drawbacks, such as expensive data
storage and transmission, information redundancy, etc. Therefore, to reduce the
spectral dimensionality effectively and learn more discriminative spectral
low-dimensional embedding, in this paper we propose a novel hyperspectral
embedding approach by simultaneously considering spatial and spectral
information, called spatial-spectral manifold embedding (SSME). Beyond the
pixel-wise spectral embedding approaches, SSME models the spatial and spectral
information jointly in a patch-based fashion. SSME not only learns the spectral
embedding by using the adjacency matrix obtained by similarity measurement
between spectral signatures, but also models the spatial neighbours of a target
pixel in hyperspectral scene by sharing the same weights (or edges) in the
process of learning embedding. Classification is explored as a potential
strategy to quantitatively evaluate the performance of learned embedding
representations. Classification is explored as a potential application for
quantitatively evaluating the performance of these hyperspectral embedding
algorithms. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely-used hyperspectral
datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed SSME as
compared to several state-of-the-art embedding methods.
