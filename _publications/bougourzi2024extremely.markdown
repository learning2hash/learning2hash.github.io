Text recognition in the wild is an important technique for digital maps and
urban scene understanding, in which the natural resembling properties between
glyphs is one of the major reasons that lead to wrong recognition results. To
address this challenge, we introduce two extremely fine-grained visual
recognition benchmark datasets that contain very challenging resembling glyphs
(characters/letters) in the wild to be distinguished. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective two-stage contrastive learning approach to the extremely
fine-grained recognition task of resembling glyphs discrimination. In the first
stage, we utilize supervised contrastive learning to leverage label information
to warm-up the backbone network. In the second stage, we introduce CCFG-Net, a
network architecture that integrates classification and contrastive learning in
both Euclidean and Angular spaces, in which contrastive learning is applied in
both supervised learning and pairwise discrimination manners to enhance the
model's feature representation capability. Overall, our proposed approach
effectively exploits the complementary strengths of contrastive learning and
classification, leading to improved recognition performance on the resembling
glyphs. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art fine-grained
classification approaches under both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
Transformer backbones demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
