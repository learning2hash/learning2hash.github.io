Everyone knows that thousand of words are represented by a single image. As a
result image search has become a very popular mechanism for the Web searchers.
Image search means, the search results are produced by the search engine should
be a set of images along with their Web page Unified Resource Locator. Now Web
searcher can perform two types of image search, they are Text to Image and
Image to Image search. In Text to Image search, search query should be a text.
Based on the input text data system will generate a set of images along with
their Web page URL as an output. On the other hand, in Image to Image search,
search query should be an image and based on this image system will generate a
set of images along with their Web page URL as an output. According to the
current scenarios, Text to Image search mechanism always not returns perfect
result. It matches the text data and then displays the corresponding images as
an output, which is not always perfect. To resolve this problem, Web
researchers have introduced the Image to Image search mechanism. In this paper,
we have also proposed an alternate approach of Image to Image search mechanism
using Histogram.
