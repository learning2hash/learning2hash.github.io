This paper presents "AI Nushu," an emerging language system inspired by Nushu
(women's scripts), the unique language created and used exclusively by ancient
Chinese women who were thought to be illiterate under a patriarchal society. In
this interactive installation, two artificial intelligence (AI) agents are
trained in the Chinese dictionary and the Nushu corpus. By continually
observing their environment and communicating, these agents collaborate towards
creating a standard writing system to encode Chinese. It offers an artistic
interpretation of the creation of a non-western script from a computational
linguistics perspective, integrating AI technology with Chinese cultural
heritage and a feminist viewpoint.
