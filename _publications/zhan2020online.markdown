With the rapid development of social websites recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of social images with user45;provided tags which continuously arrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost hashing45;based methods for image search have attracted increasing attention. However existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are based on batch mode which violates the nature of social images i.e. social images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion. Although there exist many online image hashing methods they either adopt unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags or are designed in the supervised manner which needs high45;quality labels. In this paper to overcome the above limitations we propose a new method named Weakly45;supervised Online Hashing (WOH). In order to learn high45;quality hash codes WOH exploits the weak supervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise. Besides We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH which is efficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real45;world datasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several state45;of45;the45;art hashing baselines.
