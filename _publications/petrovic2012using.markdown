First story detection (FSD) involves identifying
first stories about events from a continuous
stream of documents. A major problem in this
task is the high degree of lexical variation in
documents which makes it very difficult to detect
stories that talk about the same event but
expressed using different words. We suggest
using paraphrases to alleviate this problem,
making this the first work to use paraphrases
for FSD. We show a novel way of integrating
paraphrases with locality sensitive hashing
(LSH) in order to obtain an efficient FSD system
that can scale to very large datasets. Our
system achieves state-of-the-art results on the
first story detection task, beating both the best
supervised and unsupervised systems. To test
our approach on large data, we construct a corpus
of events for Twitter, consisting of 50 million
documents, and show that paraphrasing is
also beneficial in this domain.
