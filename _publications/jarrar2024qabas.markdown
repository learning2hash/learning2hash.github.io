We present Qabas, a novel open-source Arabic lexicon designed for NLP
applications. The novelty of Qabas lies in its synthesis of 110 lexicons.
Specifically, Qabas lexical entries (lemmas) are assembled by linking lemmas
from 110 lexicons. Furthermore, Qabas lemmas are also linked to 12
morphologically annotated corpora (about 2M tokens), making it the first Arabic
lexicon to be linked to lexicons and corpora. Qabas was developed
semi-automatically, utilizing a mapping framework and a web-based tool.
Compared with other lexicons, Qabas stands as the most extensive Arabic
lexicon, encompassing about 58K lemmas (45K nominal lemmas, 12.5K verbal
lemmas, and 473 functional-word lemmas). Qabas is open-source and accessible
