In social media like Twitter hashtags carry a lot of semantic information and can be easily distinguished from the main text. Exploring and visualizing the space of hashtags in a meaningful way can offer important insights into a dataset especially in crisis situations. In this demonstration paper we present a functioning prototype HashViz that ingests a corpus of tweets collected in the aftermath of a crisis situation (such as the Las Vegas shootings) and uses the fastText bag-of-tricks semantic embedding algorithm (from Facebook Research) to embed words and hashtags into a vector space. Hashtag vectors obtained in this way can be visualized using the t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm in 2D. Although multiple Twitter visualization platforms exist HashViz is distinguished by being simple scalable interactive and portable enough to be deployed on a server for million-tweet corpora collected in the aftermath of arbitrary disasters without special-purpose installation technical expertise manual supervision or costly software or infrastructure investment. Although simple we show that HashViz offers an intuitive way to summarize and gain insight into a developing crisis situation. HashViz is also completely unsupervised requiring no manual inputs to go from a raw corpus to a visualization and search interface. Using the recent Las Vegas mass shooting massacre as a case study we illustrate the potential of HashViz using only a web browser on the client side.
