String matching is the problem of finding all the occurrences of a pattern in a text. We propose improved versions of the fast family of string matching algorithms based on hashing \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(q\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-grams. The improvement consists of considering minimal values \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(q\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} such that each \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(q\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-grams of the pattern has a unique hash value. The new algorithms are fastest than algorithm of the HASH family for short patterns on large size alphabets.
