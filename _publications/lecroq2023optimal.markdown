<p>String matching is the problem of finding all the occurrences of a
pattern in a text. We propose improved versions of the fast family of
string matching algorithms based on hashing <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-grams. The improvement consists of
considering minimal values <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> such
that each <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-grams of the pattern
has a unique hash value. The new algorithms are fastest than algorithm
of the HASH family for short patterns on large size alphabets.</p>
