String matching is the problem of finding all the occurrences of a pattern in
a text. We propose improved versions of the fast family of string matching
algorithms based on hashing \\(q\\)-grams. The improvement consists of considering
minimal values \\(q\\) such that each \\(q\\)-grams of the pattern has a unique hash
value. The new algorithms are fastest than algorithm of the HASH family for
short patterns on large size alphabets.
