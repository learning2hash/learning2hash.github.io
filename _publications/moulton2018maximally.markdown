We introduce simple, efficient algorithms for computing a MinHash of a
probability distribution, suitable for both sparse and dense data, with
equivalent running times to the state of the art for both cases. The collision
probability of these algorithms is a new measure of the similarity of positive
vectors which we investigate in detail. We describe the sense in which this
collision probability is optimal for any Locality Sensitive Hash based on
sampling. We argue that this similarity measure is more useful for probability
distributions than the similarity pursued by other algorithms for weighted
MinHash, and is the natural generalization of the Jaccard index.
