Cross-lingual information retrieval is a challenging task in the absence of
aligned parallel corpora. In this paper, we address this problem by considering
topically aligned corpora designed for evaluating an IR setup. To emphasize, we
neither use any sentence-aligned corpora or document-aligned corpora, nor do we
use any language specific resources such as dictionary, thesaurus, or grammar
rules. Instead, we use an embedding into a common space and learn word
correspondences directly from there. We test our proposed approach for
bilingual IR on standard FIRE datasets for Bangla, Hindi and English. The
proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art method not only for IR
evaluation measures but also in terms of time requirements. We extend our
method successfully to the trilingual setting.
