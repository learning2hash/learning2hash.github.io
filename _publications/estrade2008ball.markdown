Ball throwing on Euclidean spaces has been considered for a while. A suitable
renormalization leads to a fractional Brownian motion as limit object. In this
paper we investigate ball throwing on spheres. A different behavior is
exhibited: we still get a Gaussian limit but which is no longer a fractional
Brownian motion. However the limit is locally self-similar when the
self-similarity index \\(H\\) is less than 1/2.
