We study divisibility properties of a set
\(\\{f_1(\mathbf\{U\}_n^\{(s)\}),\ldots,f_m(\mathbf\{U\}_n^\{(s)\})\\}\), where
\(f_1,\ldots,f_m\) are polynomials in \(s\) variables over \(\mathbb\{Z\}\) and
\(\mathbf\{U\}_n^\{(s)\}\) is a point picked uniformly at random from the set
\(\\{1,\ldots,n\\}^s\), \(s\in\mathbb\{N\}\). We show that the \(\{\rm GCD\}\) and the
suitably normalized \(\{\rm LCM\}\) of this set converge in distribution to a.s.\
finite random variables under mild assumptions on \(f_1,\ldots, f_m\). Our
approach is based on the notion of integer adeles and a known fact that the
uniform distribution on \(\\{1,\ldots, n\\}\) converges to the Haar measure on the
ring of integer adeles combined with the Lang-Weil bounds.
