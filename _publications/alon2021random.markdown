It is known that any open necklace with beads of \(t\) types in which the
number of beads of each type is divisible by \(k\), can be partitioned by at most
\((k-1)t\) cuts into intervals that can be distributed into \(k\) collections, each
containing the same number of beads of each type. This is tight for all values
of \(k\) and \(t\).
  Here, we consider the case of random necklaces, where the number of beads of
each type is \(km\). Then the minimum number of cuts required for a ``fair''
partition with the above property is a random variable \(X(k,t,m)\). We prove
that for fixed \(k,t,\) and large \(m\), this random variable is at least
\((k-1)(t+1)/2\) with high probability. For \(k=2\), fixed \(t\), and large \(m\), we
determine the asymptotic behavior of the probability that \(X(2,t,m)=s\) for all
values of \(s\le t \). We show that this probability is polynomially small when
\(s<(t+1)/2\), it is bounded away from zero when \(s>(t+1)/2\), and decays like
\(\Theta ( 1/log m)\) when \(s=(t+1)/2\).
  We also show that for large \(t\), \(X(2,t,1)\) is at most \((0.4+o(1))t\) with
high probability and that for large \(t\) and large ratio \(k/log t\), \(X(k,t,1)\)
is \(o(kt)\) with high probability.
