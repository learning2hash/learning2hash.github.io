In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot template-matching algorithm to
automatically capture data from business documents with an aim to minimize
manual data entry. Given one annotated document, our algorithm can
automatically extract similar data from other documents having the same format.
Based on a set of engineered visual and textual features, our method is
invariant to changes in position and value. Experiments on a dataset of 595
real invoices demonstrate 86.4% accuracy.
