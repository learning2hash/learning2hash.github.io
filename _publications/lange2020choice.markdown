Recent work showed that embeddings from related languages can improve the
performance of sequence tagging, even for monolingual models. In this analysis
paper, we investigate whether the best auxiliary language can be predicted
based on language distances and show that the most related language is not
always the best auxiliary language. Further, we show that attention-based
meta-embeddings can effectively combine pre-trained embeddings from different
languages for sequence tagging and set new state-of-the-art results for
part-of-speech tagging in five languages.
