We give an \(\tilde O(n^2)\) time algorithm for computing the exact Dynamic
Time Warping distance between two strings whose run-length encoding is of size
at most \(n\). This matches (up to log factors) the known (conditional) lower
bound, and should be compared with the previous fastest \(O(n^3)\) time exact
algorithm and the \(\tilde O(n^2)\) time approximation algorithm.
