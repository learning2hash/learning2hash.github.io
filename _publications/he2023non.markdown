In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the non-simple
systole, which is the length of a shortest non-simple closed geodesic, on a
random closed hyperbolic surface on the moduli space \(\mathcal\{M\}_g\) of Riemann
surfaces of genus \(g\) endowed with the Weil-Petersson measure. We show that as
the genus \(g\) goes to infinity, the non-simple systole of a generic hyperbolic
surface in \(\mathcal\{M\}_g\) behaves exactly like \(log g\).
