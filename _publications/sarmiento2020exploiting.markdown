The rise of deep learning applications in the fashion industry has fueled
advances in curating large-scale datasets to build applications for product
design, image retrieval, and recommender systems. In this paper, the author
proposes using Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to build an interactive fashion
product application framework that allows the users to generate products with
attributes according to their liking, retrieve similar styles for the same
product category, and receive content-based recommendations from other
categories. Fashion product images dataset containing eyewear, footwear, and
bags are appropriate to illustrate that this pipeline is applicable in the
booming industry of e-commerce enabling direct user interaction in specifying
desired products paired with new methods for data matching, and recommendation
systems by using VAE and exploiting its generated latent codes.
