In this paper, we propose the \\(K\\)-Shot Contrastive Learning (KSCL) of visual
features by applying multiple augmentations to investigate the sample
variations within individual instances. It aims to combine the advantages of
inter-instance discrimination by learning discriminative features to
distinguish between different instances, as well as intra-instance variations
by matching queries against the variants of augmented samples over instances.
Particularly, for each instance, it constructs an instance subspace to model
the configuration of how the significant factors of variations in \\(K\\)-shot
augmentations can be combined to form the variants of augmentations. Given a
query, the most relevant variant of instances is then retrieved by projecting
the query onto their subspaces to predict the positive instance class. This
generalizes the existing contrastive learning that can be viewed as a special
one-shot case. An eigenvalue decomposition is performed to configure instance
subspaces, and the embedding network can be trained end-to-end through the
differentiable subspace configuration. Experiment results demonstrate the
proposed \\(K\\)-shot contrastive learning achieves superior performances to the
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.
