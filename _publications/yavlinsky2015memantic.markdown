We present a system that constructs and maintains an up-to-date co-occurrence
network of medical concepts based on continuously mining the latest biomedical
literature. Users can explore this network visually via a concise online
interface to quickly discover important and novel relationships between medical
entities. This enables users to rapidly gain contextual understanding of their
medical topics of interest, and we believe this constitutes a significant user
experience improvement over contemporary search engines operating in the
biomedical literature domain.
