We obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the longest increasing/non-decreasing
subsequences in a random uniform multiset permutation in which each element in
\{1,...,n\} occurs k times, where k may depend on n. This generalizes the famous
Ulam-Hammersley problem of the case k=1. The proof relies on poissonization and
a connection with variants of the Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis particle system.
