Music genres are shaped by both the stylistic features of songs and the
cultural preferences of artists' audiences. Automatic classification of music
genres using lyrics can be useful in several applications such as
recommendation systems, playlist creation, and library organization. We present
a multi-label, cross-lingual genre classification system based on multilingual
sentence embeddings generated by sBERT. Using a bilingual Portuguese-English
dataset with eight overlapping genres, we demonstrate the system's ability to
train on lyrics in one language and predict genres in another. Our approach
outperforms the baseline approach of translating lyrics and using a
bag-of-words representation, improving the genrewise average F1-Score from 0.35
to 0.69. The classifier uses a one-vs-all architecture, enabling it to assign
multiple genre labels to a single lyric. Experimental results reveal that
dataset centralization notably improves cross-lingual performance. This
approach offers a scalable solution for genre classification across
underrepresented languages and cultural domains, advancing the capabilities of
music information retrieval systems.
