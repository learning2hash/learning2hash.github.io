Similarity searching of molecular structure has been an important application
in the Chemoinformatics, especially in drug discovery. Similarity searching is
a common method used for identification of molecular structure. It involve
three main principal component of similarity searching: structure
representation; weighting scheme; and similarity coefficient. In this paper, we
introduces Weighted Tanimoto Coefficient based on weighted Euclidean distance
in order to investigate the effect of weight function on the result for
similarity searching. The Tanimoto coefficient is one of the popular similarity
coefficients used to measure the similarity between pairs of the molecule. The
most of research area found that the similarity searching is based on binary or
fingerprint data. Meanwhile, we used non-binary data and was set amphetamine
structure as a reference or targeted structure and the rest of the dataset
becomes a database structure. Throughout this study, it showed that there is
definitely gives a different result between a similarity searching with and
without weight.
