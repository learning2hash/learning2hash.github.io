Image compositions are helpful in the study of image structures and assist in
discovering the semantics of the underlying scene portrayed across art forms
and styles. With the digitization of artworks in recent years, thousands of
images of a particular scene or narrative could potentially be linked together.
However, manually linking this data with consistent objectiveness can be a
highly challenging and time-consuming task. In this work, we present a novel
approach called Image Composition Canvas (ICC++) to compare and retrieve images
having similar compositional elements. ICC++ is an improvement over ICC
specializing in generating low and high-level features (compositional elements)
motivated by Max Imdahl's work. To this end, we present a rigorous quantitative
and qualitative comparison of our approach with traditional and
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods showing that our proposed method outperforms
all of them. In combination with deep features, our method outperforms the best
deep learning-based method, opening the research direction for explainable
machine learning for digital humanities. We will release the code and the data
post-publication.
