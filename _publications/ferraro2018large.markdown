The importance of repetitions in music is well-known. In this paper, we study
music repetitions in the context of effective and efficient automatic genre
classification in large-scale music-databases. We aim at enhancing the access
and organization of pieces of music in Digital Libraries by allowing automatic
categorization of entire collections by considering only their musical content.
We handover to the public a set of genre-specific patterns to support research
in musicology. The patterns can be used, for instance, to explore and analyze
the relations between musical genres. There are many existing algorithms that
could be used to identify and extract repeating patterns in symbolically
encoded music. In our case, the extracted patterns are used as representations
of the pieces of music on the underlying corpus and, consecutively, to train
and evaluate a classifier to automatically identify genres. In this paper, we
apply two very fast algorithms enabling us to experiment on large and diverse
corpora. Thus, we are able to find patterns with strong discrimination power
that can be used in various applications. We carried out experiments on a
corpus containing over 40,000 MIDI files annotated with at least one genre. The
experiments suggest that our approach is scalable and capable of dealing with
real-world-size music collections.
