We propose and discuss a paradigm that allows for expressing
*data-parallel* rendering with the classically non-parallel ANARI API. We
propose this as a new standard for data-parallel sci-vis rendering, describe
two different implementations of this paradigm, and use multiple sample
integrations into existing apps to show how easy it is to adopt this paradigm,
and what can be gained from doing so.
