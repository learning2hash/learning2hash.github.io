The family of Information Dispersal Algorithms is applied to distributed
systems for secure and reliable storage and transmission. In comparison with
perfect secret sharing it achieves a significantly smaller memory overhead and
better performance, but provides only incremental confidentiality. Therefore,
even if it is not possible to explicitly reconstruct data from less than the
required amount of fragments, it is still possible to deduce some information
about the nature of data by looking at preserved data patterns inside a
fragment. The idea behind this paper is to provide a lightweight data
fragmentation scheme, that would combine the space efficiency and simplicity
that could be find in Information Dispersal Algorithms with a computational
level of data confidentiality.
