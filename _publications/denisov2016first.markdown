We consider random walks with independent but not necessarily identical
distributed increments. Assuming that the increments satisfy the well-known
Lindeberg condition, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of first-passage
times over moving boundaries. Furthermore, we prove that a properly rescaled
random walk conditioned to stay above the boundary up to time \(n\) converges, as
\(n\to\infty\), towards the Brownian meander.
