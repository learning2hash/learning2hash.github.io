We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional
Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed
nor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical
architectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object
classification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with
error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%, 0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple
back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is
surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error
rates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after 1, 3 and 17 epochs,
respectively.
