<p>HighwayHash is a new pseudo-random function based on SIMD multiply
and permute instructions for thorough and fast hashing. It is 5.2 times
as fast as SipHash for 1 KiB inputs. An open-source implementation is
available under a permissive license. We discuss design choices and
provide statistical analysis, speed measurements and preliminary
cryptanalysis. Assuming it withstands further analysis, strengthened
variants may also substantially accelerate file checksums and stream
ciphers.</p>
