Many distributed learning techniques have been motivated by the increasing
size of datasets and their inability to fit into main memory on a single
machine. We propose an algorithm that finds the nearest neighbor in a graph
locally without the need of visiting the whole graph. Our algorithm is
distributed which further encourage scalability. We prove the convergence of
the algorithm
