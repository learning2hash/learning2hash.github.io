Let \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\) be the finite field of \(q\) elements. In this paper we
obtain bounds on the following counting problem: given a polynomial \(f(x)\in
\mathbb\{F\}_q[x]\) of degree \(k+m\) and a non-negative integer \(r\), count the
number of polynomials \(g(x)\in \mathbb\{F\}_q[x]\) of degree at most \(k-1\) such
that \(f(x)+g(x)\) has exactly \(r\) roots in \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\). Previously, explicit
formulas were known only for the cases \(m=0, 1, 2\). As an application, we
obtain an asymptotic formula on the list size of the standard Reed-Solomon code
\([q, k, q-k+1]_q\).
