The biggest challenge when using DNA as a storage medium is maintaining its
stability. The relative occurrence of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) is essential
for the longevity of DNA. In addition to that, reverse complementary base pairs
should not be present in the code. These challenges are overcome by a proper
choice of group homomorphisms. Algorithms for storage and retrieval of
information in DNA stings are written by using kernel code. Complexities of
these algorithms are less compared to the existing algorithms. Construction
procedures followed in this paper are capable of constructing codes of required
sizes and Reverse complement distance.
