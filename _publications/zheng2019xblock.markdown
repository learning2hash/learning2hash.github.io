Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have received extensive attention recently.
Massive data has been stored on permission-less blockchains. The analysis on
massive blockchain data can bring huge business values. However, the lack of
well-processed up-to-date blockchain datasets impedes big data analytics of
blockchain data. To fill this gap, we collect and process the up-to-date
on-chain data from Ethereum, which is one of the most popular permission-less
blockchains. We name these well-processed Ethereum datasets as XBlock-ETH,
which consists of the data of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and
cryptocurrencies (i.e., tokens). The basic statistics and exploration of these
datasets are presented. We also outline the possible research opportunities.
The datasets with the raw data and codes have been publicly released online.
