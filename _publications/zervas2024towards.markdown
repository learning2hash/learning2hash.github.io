Split Learning has been recently introduced to facilitate applications where
user data privacy is a requirement. However, it has not been thoroughly studied
in the context of Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage, a problem in which the
same real-world entity should be identified among databases from different
dataholders, but without disclosing any additional information. In this paper,
we investigate the potentials of Split Learning for Privacy-Preserving Record
Matching, by introducing a novel training method through the utilization of
Reference Sets, which are publicly available data corpora, showcasing minimal
matching impact against a traditional centralized SVM-based technique.
