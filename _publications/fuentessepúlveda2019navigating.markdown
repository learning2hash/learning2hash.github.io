We show that any embedding of a planar graph can be encoded succinctly while
efficiently answering a number of topological queries near-optimally. More
precisely, we build on a succinct representation that encodes an embedding of
\\(m\\) edges within \\(4m\\) bits, which is close to the information-theoretic lower
bound of about \\(3.58m\\). With \\(4m+o(m)\\) bits of space, we show how to answer a
number of topological queries relating nodes, edges, and faces, most of them in
any time in \\(\omega(1)\\). Further, we show that with \\(O(m)\\) bits of space we can
solve all those operations in \\(O(1)\\) time.
