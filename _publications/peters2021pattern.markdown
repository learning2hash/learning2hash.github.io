A new solution for the Dutch national flag problem is proposed, requiring no
three-way comparisons, which gives quicksort a proper worst-case runtime of
\(O(nk)\) for inputs with \(k\) distinct elements. This is used together with other
known and novel techniques to construct a hybrid sort that is never
significantly slower than regular quicksort while speeding up drastically for
many input distributions.
