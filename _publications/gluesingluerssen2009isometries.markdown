In this paper we will discuss isometries and strong isometries for
convolutional codes. Isometries are weight-preserving module isomorphisms
whereas strong isometries are, in addition, degree-preserving. Special cases of
these maps are certain types of monomial transformations. We will show a form
of MacWilliams Equivalence Theorem, that is, each isometry between
convolutional codes is given by a monomial transformation. Examples show that
strong isometries cannot be characterized this way, but special attention paid
to the weight adjacency matrices allows for further descriptions. Various
distance parameters appearing in the literature on convolutional codes will be
discussed as well.
