We investigate the construction of weakly-secure index codes for a sender to
send messages to multiple receivers with side information in the presence of an
eavesdropper. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence
of index codes that are secure against an eavesdropper with access to any
subset of messages of cardinality \(t\), for any fixed \(t\). In contrast to the
benefits of using random keys in secure network coding, we prove that random
keys do not promote security in three classes of index-coding instances.
