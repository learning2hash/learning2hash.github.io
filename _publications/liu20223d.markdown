Previous top-performing methods for 3D instance segmentation often maintain
inter-task dependencies and the tendency towards a lack of robustness. Besides,
inevitable variations of different datasets make these methods become
particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values and manifest poor
generalization capability. In this paper, we address the aforementioned
challenges by proposing a novel query-based method, termed as 3D-QueryIS, which
is detector-free, semantic segmentation-free, and cluster-free. Specifically,
we propose to generate representative points in an implicit manner, and use
them together with the initial queries to generate the informative instance
queries. Then, the class and binary instance mask predictions can be produced
by simply applying MLP layers on top of the instance queries and the extracted
point cloud embeddings. Thus, our 3D-QueryIS is free from the accumulated
errors caused by the inter-task dependencies. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
3D-QueryIS method.
