This paper describes a new approach, called Terminological Bucket Indexing
(TBI), for efficient indexing and retrieval of both nested and super terms
using a single method. We propose a hybrid data structure for facilitating
faster indexing building. An evaluation of our approach with respect to widely
used existing approaches on several publicly available dataset is provided.
Compared to Trie based approaches, TBI provides comparable performance on
nested term retrieval and far superior performance on super term retrieval.
Compared to traditional hash table, TBI needs 80% less time for indexing.
