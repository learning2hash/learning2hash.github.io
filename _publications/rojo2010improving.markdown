The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma allows for the projection of \(n\) points in
\(p-\)dimensional Euclidean space onto a \(k-\)dimensional Euclidean space, with \(k
\ge \frac\{24\ln *n*\}\{3\epsilon^2-2\epsilon^3\}\), so that the pairwise
distances are preserved within a factor of \(1\pm\epsilon\). Here, working
directly with the distributions of the random distances rather than resorting
to the moment generating function technique, an improvement on the lower bound
for \(k\) is obtained. The additional reduction in dimension when compared to
bounds found in the literature, is at least \(13%\), and, in some cases, up to
\(30%\) additional reduction is achieved. Using the moment generating function
technique, we further provide a lower bound for \(k\) using pairwise \(L_2\)
distances in the space of points to be projected and pairwise \(L_1\) distances
in the space of the projected points. Comparison with the results obtained in
the literature shows that the bound presented here provides an additional
\(36-40%\) reduction.
