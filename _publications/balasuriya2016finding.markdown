Most street gang members use Twitter to intimidate others, to present
outrageous images and statements to the world, and to share recent illegal
activities. Their tweets may thus be useful to law enforcement agencies to
discover clues about recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur.
Finding these posts, however, requires a method to discover gang member Twitter
profiles. This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small
population of the 320 million Twitter users. This paper studies the problem of
automatically finding gang members on Twitter. It outlines a process to curate
one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member profiles that have ever been
studied. A review of these profiles establishes differences in the language,
images, YouTube links, and emojis gang members use compared to the rest of the
Twitter population. Features from this review are used to train a series of
supervised classifiers. Our classifier achieves a promising F1 score with a low
false positive rate.
