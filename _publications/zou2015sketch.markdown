We present a multi-scale approach to sketch-based shape retrieval. It is
based on a novel multi-scale shape descriptor called Pyramidof- Parts, which
encodes the features and spatial relationship of the semantic parts of query
sketches. The same descriptor can also be used to represent 2D projected views
of 3D shapes, allowing effective matching of query sketches with 3D shapes
across multiple scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art method, whether the sketch segmentation
information is obtained manually or automatically by considering each stroke as
a semantic part.
