We study the convex relaxation of clustering and hamming embedding, focusing
on the asymmetric case (co-clustering and asymmetric hamming embedding),
understanding their relationship to LSH as studied by (Charikar 2002) and to
the max-norm ball, and the differences between their symmetric and asymmetric
versions.
