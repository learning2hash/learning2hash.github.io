We study the limiting shape of the connected components of the vacant set of
two-dimensional Brownian random interlacements: we prove that the connected
component around \\(x\\) is close in distribution to a rescaled *Brownian
amoeba* in the regime when the distance from \\(x\in\mathbb\{C\}\\) to the closest
trajectory is small (which, in particular, includes the cases \\(x\to\infty\\) with
fixed intensity parameter \\(\alpha\\), and \\(\alpha\to\infty\\) with fixed \\(x\\)). We
also obtain a new family of martingales built on the conditioned Brownian
motion, which may be of independent interest.
