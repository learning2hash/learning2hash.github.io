This paper presents a novel method for mapping spectral features of the Moon
using machine learning-based clustering of hyperspectral data from the Moon
Mineral Mapper (M3) imaging spectrometer. The method uses a convolutional
variational autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and
extract features of the spectra. Then, a k-means algorithm is applied to
cluster the latent variables into five distinct groups, corresponding to
dominant spectral features, which are related to the mineral composition of the
Moon's surface. The resulting global spectral cluster map shows the
distribution of the five clusters on the Moon, which consist of a mixture of,
among others, plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and Fe-bearing minerals across
the Moon's surface. The clusters are compared to the mineral maps from the
Kaguya mission, which showed that the locations of the clusters overlap with
the locations of high wt% of minerals such as plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and
olivine. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of unbiased unsupervised
learning for lunar mineral exploration and provides a comprehensive analysis of
lunar mineralogy.
