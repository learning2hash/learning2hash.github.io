Cultures across the world have evolved to have unique patterns despite shared
ingredients and cooking techniques. Using data obtained from RecipeDB, an
online resource for recipes, we extract patterns in 26 world cuisines and
further probe for their inter-relatedness. By application of frequent itemset
mining and ingredient authenticity we characterize the quintessential patterns
in the cuisines and build a hierarchical tree of the world cuisines. This tree
provides interesting insights into the evolution of cuisines and their
geographical as well as historical relatedness.
