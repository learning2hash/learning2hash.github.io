Digital tools for text analysis have long been essential for the
searchability and accessibility of digitised library collections. Recent
computer vision advances have introduced similar capabilities for visual
materials, with deep learning-based embeddings showing promise for analysing
visual heritage. Given that many books feature visuals in addition to text,
taking advantage of these breakthroughs is critical to making library
collections open and accessible. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept
image search application for exploring images in the National Library of
Norway's pre-1900 books, comparing Vision Transformer (ViT), Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), and Sigmoid loss for Language-Image
Pre-training (SigLIP) embeddings for image retrieval and classification. Our
results show that the application performs well for exact image retrieval, with
SigLIP embeddings slightly outperforming CLIP and ViT in both retrieval and
classification tasks. Additionally, SigLIP-based image classification can aid
in cleaning image datasets from a digitisation pipeline.
