We introduce and study a random non-compact space called the bigeodesic
Brownian plane, and prove that it is the tangent plane in distribution of the
Brownian sphere at a point of its simple geodesic from the root (for the local
Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov-Uniform topology). We also show that it is the local
limit of the Brownian plane rerooted further and further on its unique infinite
geodesic. Furthermore, we discuss various properties of this space, such as its
topology, the behavior of its geodesic rays, and its invariance in distribution
under several natural transformations.
