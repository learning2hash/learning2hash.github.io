In this work, we present a new framework for the stylization of text-based
binary images. First, our method stylizes the stroke-based geometric shape like
text, symbols and icons in the target binary image based on an input style
image. Second, the composition of the stylized geometric shape and a background
image is explored. To accomplish the task, we propose legibility-preserving
structure and texture transfer algorithms, which progressively narrow the
visual differences between the binary image and the style image. The
stylization is then followed by a context-aware layout design algorithm, where
cues for both seamlessness and aesthetics are employed to determine the optimal
layout of the shape in the background. Given the layout, the binary image is
seamlessly embedded into the background by texture synthesis under a
context-aware boundary constraint. According to the contents of binary images,
our method can be applied to many fields. We show that the proposed method is
capable of addressing the unsupervised text stylization problem and is superior
to state-of-the-art style transfer methods in automatic artistic typography
creation. Besides, extensive experiments on various tasks, such as
visual-textual presentation synthesis, icon/symbol rendering and
structure-guided image inpainting, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.
