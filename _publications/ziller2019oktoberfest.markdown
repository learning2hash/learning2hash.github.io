We release a realistic, diverse, and challenging dataset for object detection
on images. The data was recorded at a beer tent in Germany and consists of 15
different categories of food and drink items. We created more than 2,500 object
annotations by hand for 1,110 images captured by a video camera above the
checkout. We further make available the remaining 600GB of (unlabeled) data
containing days of footage. Additionally, we provide our trained models as a
benchmark. Possible applications include automated checkout systems which could
significantly speed up the process.
