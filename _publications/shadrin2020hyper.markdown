Plant diseases can lead to dramatic losses in yield and quality of food,
becoming a problem of high priority for farmers. Apple scab, moniliasis, and
powdery mildew are the most significant apple tree diseases worldwide and may
cause between 50% and 60% in yield losses annually; they are controlled by
fungicide use with huge financial and time expenses. This research proposes a
modern approach for analyzing the spectral data in Near-Infrared and
Mid-Infrared ranges of the apple tree diseases at different stages. Using the
obtained spectra, we found optimal spectral bands for detecting particular
disease and discriminating it from other diseases and healthy trees. The
proposed instrument will provide farmers with accurate, real-time information
on different stages of apple tree diseases, enabling more effective timing, and
selecting the fungicide application, resulting in better control and increasing
yield. The obtained dataset, as well as scripts in Matlab for processing data
and finding optimal spectral bands, are available via the link:
