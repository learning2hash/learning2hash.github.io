Exploratory search aims to guide users through a corpus rather than
pinpointing exact information. We propose an exploratory search system based on
hierarchical clusters and document summaries using sentence embeddings. With
sentence embeddings, we represent documents as the mean of their embedded
sentences, extract summaries containing sentences close to this document
representation and extract keyphrases close to the document representation. To
evaluate our search system, we scrape our personal search history over the past
year and report our experience with the system. We then discuss motivating use
cases of an exploratory search system of this nature and conclude with possible
directions of future work.
