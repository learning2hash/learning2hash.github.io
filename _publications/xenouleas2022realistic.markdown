We consider zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in legal topic classification
using the recent MultiEURLEX dataset. Since the original dataset contains
parallel documents, which is unrealistic for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer,
we develop a new version of the dataset without parallel documents. We use it
to show that translation-based methods vastly outperform cross-lingual
fine-tuning of multilingually pre-trained models, the best previous zero-shot
transfer method for MultiEURLEX. We also develop a bilingual teacher-student
zero-shot transfer approach, which exploits additional unlabeled documents of
the target language and performs better than a model fine-tuned directly on
labeled target language documents.
