Similarity45;preserving hashing is a commonly used method for nearest neighbour search in large45;scale image retrieval. For image retrieval deep45;networks45;based hashing methods are appealing since they can simultaneously learn effective image representations and compact hash codes. This paper focuses on deep45;networks45;based hashing for multi45;label images each of which may contain objects of multiple categories. In most existing hashing methods each image is represented by one piece of hash code which is referred to as semantic hashing. This setting may be suboptimal for multi45;label image retrieval. To solve this problem we propose a deep architecture that learns textbf123;instance45;aware125; image representations for multi45;label image data which are organized in multiple groups with each group containing the features for one category. The instance45;aware representations not only bring advantages to semantic hashing but also can be used in category45;aware hashing in which an image is represented by multiple pieces of hash codes and each piece of code corresponds to a category. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that for both semantic hashing and category45;aware hashing the proposed method shows substantial improvement over the state45;of45;the45;art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.
