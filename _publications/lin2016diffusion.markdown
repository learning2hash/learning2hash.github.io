To guarantee the integrity and security of data transmitted through the
Internet, hash functions are fundamental tools. But recent researches have
shown that security flaws exist in the most widely used hash functions. So a
new way to improve their security performance is urgently demanded. In this
article, we propose new hash functions based on chaotic iterations, which have
chaotic properties as defined by Devaney. The corresponding diffusion and
confusion analyzes are provided and a comparative study between the proposed
hash functions is carried out, to make their use more applicable in any
security context.
