A cluster of \(n\) needles (\(1\leq n<\infty\)) is dropped at random onto a plane
lattice of rectangles. Each needle is fixed at one end in the cluster centre
and can rotate independently about this centre. The distribution of the
relative number of needles intersecting the lattice is shown to converge
uniformly to the limit distribution as \(n\rightarrow\infty\).
