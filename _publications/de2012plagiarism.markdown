Given the large number of new musical tracks released each year, automated
approaches to plagiarism detection are essential to help us track potential
violations of copyright. Most current approaches to plagiarism detection are
based on musical similarity measures, which typically ignore the issue of
polyphony in music. We present a novel feature space for audio derived from
compositional modelling techniques, commonly used in signal separation, that
provides a mechanism to account for polyphony without incurring an inordinate
amount of computational overhead. We employ this feature representation in
conjunction with traditional audio feature representations in a classification
framework which uses an ensemble of distance features to characterize pairs of
songs as being plagiarized or not. Our experiments on a database of about 3000
musical track pairs show that the new feature space characterization produces
significant improvements over standard baselines.
