Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979, are of
great importance in computer science with many applications. MMH\\(^*\\) is a
well-known \\(\triangle\\)-universal hash function family, based on the evaluation
of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper, we introduce a generalization
of MMH\\(^*\\), that we call GMMH\\(^*\\), using the same construction as MMH\\(^*\\) but
with an arbitrary integer modulus \\(n>1\\), and show that GMMH\\(^*\\) is
\\(\frac\{1\}\{p\}\\)-almost-\\(\triangle\\)-universal, where \\(p\\) is the smallest prime
divisor of \\(n\\). This bound is tight.
