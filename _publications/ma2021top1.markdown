In this paper, we describe the solution to the QQ Browser 2021 Ai Algorithm
Competition (AIAC) Track 1. We use the multi-modal transformer model for the
video embedding extraction. In the pretrain phase, we train the model with
three tasks, (1) Video Tag Classification (VTC), (2) Mask Language Modeling
(MLM) and (3) Mask Frame Modeling (MFM). In the finetune phase, we train the
model with video similarity based on rank normalized human labels. Our full
pipeline, after ensembling several models, scores 0.852 on the leaderboard,
which we achieved the 1st place in the competition. The source codes have been
released at Github.
