In this work we consider regularized Wasserstein barycenters (average in
Wasserstein distance) in Fourier basis. We prove that random Fourier parameters
of the barycenter converge to some Gaussian random vector by distribution. The
convergence rate has been derived in finite-sample case with explicit
dependence on measures count (\(n\)) and the dimension of parameters (\(p\)).
