Detecting visual relationships between people and clothing in an image has
been a relatively unexplored problem in the field of computer vision and
biometrics. The lack readily available public dataset for ``worn'' and
``unworn'' classification has slowed the development of solutions for this
problem. We present the release of the Relatable Clothing Dataset which
contains 35287 person-clothing pairs and segmentation masks for the development
of ``worn'' and ``unworn'' classification models. Additionally, we propose a
novel soft attention unit for performing ``worn'' and ``unworn'' classification
using deep neural networks. The proposed soft attention models have an accuracy
of upward \(98.55% \pm 0.35%\) on the Relatable Clothing Dataset and
demonstrate high generalizable, allowing us to classify unseen articles of
clothing such as high visibility vests as ``worn'' or ``unworn''.
