In recent years, the use of image-based techniques for malware detection has
gained prominence, with numerous studies demonstrating the efficacy of deep
learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in classifying
images derived from executable files. In this paper, we consider an innovative
method that relies on an image conversion process that consists of transforming
features extracted from executable files into QR and Aztec codes. These codes
capture structural patterns in a format that may enhance the learning
capabilities of CNNs. We design and implement CNN architectures tailored to the
unique properties of these codes and apply them to a comprehensive analysis
involving two extensive malware datasets, both of which include a significant
corpus of benign samples. Our results yield a split decision, with CNNs trained
on QR and Aztec codes outperforming the state of the art on one of the
datasets, but underperforming more typical techniques on the other dataset.
These results indicate that the use of QR and Aztec codes as a form of feature
engineering holds considerable promise in the malware domain, and that
additional research is needed to better understand the relative strengths and
weaknesses of such an approach.
