We present Thistle, a fully functional vector database. Thistle is an entry
into the domain of latent knowledge use in answering search queries, an ongoing
research topic at both start-ups and search engine companies. We implement
Thistle with several well-known algorithms, and benchmark results on the MS
MARCO dataset. Results help clarify the latent knowledge domain as well as the
growing Rust ML ecosystem.
