Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized social movement protesting
violence against Black individuals and communities, with a focus on police
brutality. The movement gained significant attention following the killings of
Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd in 2020. The #BlackLivesMatter
social media hashtag has come to represent the grassroots movement, with
similar hashtags counter protesting the BLM movement, such as #AllLivesMatter,
and #BlueLivesMatter. We introduce a data set of 63.9 million tweets from 13.0
million users from over 100 countries which contain one of the following
keywords: BlackLivesMatter, AllLivesMatter, and BlueLivesMatter. This data set
contains all currently available tweets from the beginning of the BLM movement
in 2013 to 2021. We summarize the data set and show temporal trends in use of
both the BlackLivesMatter keyword and keywords associated with counter
movements. Additionally, for each keyword, we create and release a set of
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics (i.e., automatically clustered groups
of semantically co-occuring words) to aid researchers in identifying linguistic
patterns across the three keywords.
