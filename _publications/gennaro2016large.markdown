In this work, we propose an approach to index Deep Convolutional Neural
Network Features to support efficient content-based retrieval on large image
databases. To this aim, we have converted the these features into a textual
form, to index them into an inverted index by means of Lucene. In this way, we
were able to set up a robust retrieval system that combines full-text search
with content-based image retrieval capabilities. We evaluated different
strategies of textual representation in order to optimize the index occupation
and the query response time. In order to show that our approach is able to
handle large datasets, we have developed a web-based prototype that provides an
interface for combined textual and visual searching into a dataset of about 100
million of images.
