Identifying named entities is, in general, a practical and challenging task
in the field of Natural Language Processing. Named Entity Recognition on the
code-mixed text is further challenging due to the linguistic complexity
resulting from the nature of the mixing. This paper addresses the submission of
team CMNEROne to the SEMEVAL 2022 shared task 11 MultiCoNER. The Code-mixed NER
task aimed to identify named entities on the code-mixed dataset. Our work
consists of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the code-mixed dataset by
leveraging the multilingual data. We achieved a weighted average F1 score of
0.7044, i.e., 6% greater than the baseline.
