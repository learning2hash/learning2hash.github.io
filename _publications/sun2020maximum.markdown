Consider a nearest-neighbor random walk with certain asymptotically zero
drift on the positive half line. Let \(M\) be the maximum of an excursion
starting from \(1\) and ending at \(0.\) We study the distribution of \(M\) and
characterize its asymptotics, which is quite different from those of simple
random walks.
