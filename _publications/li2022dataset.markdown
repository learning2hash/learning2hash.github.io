Sharing medical datasets between hospitals is challenging because of the
privacy-protection problem and the massive cost of transmitting and storing
many high-resolution medical images. However, dataset distillation can
synthesize a small dataset such that models trained on it achieve comparable
performance with the original large dataset, which shows potential for solving
the existing medical sharing problems. Hence, this paper proposes a novel
dataset distillation-based method for medical dataset sharing. Experimental
results on a COVID-19 chest X-ray image dataset show that our method can
achieve high detection performance even using scarce anonymized chest X-ray
images.
