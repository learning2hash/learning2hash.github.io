Hashtags are often employed on social media and beyond to add metadata to a
textual utterance with the goal of increasing discoverability, aiding search,
or providing additional semantics. However, the semantic content of hashtags is
not straightforward to infer as these represent ad-hoc conventions which
frequently include multiple words joined together and can include abbreviations
and unorthodox spellings. We build a dataset of 12,594 hashtags split into
individual segments and propose a set of approaches for hashtag segmentation by
framing it as a pairwise ranking problem between candidate segmentations. Our
novel neural approaches demonstrate 24.6% error reduction in hashtag
segmentation accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Finally,
we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of hashtag semantics obtained
through segmentation is useful for downstream applications such as sentiment
analysis, for which we achieved a 2.6% increase in average recall on the
SemEval 2017 sentiment analysis dataset.
