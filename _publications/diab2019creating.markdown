We present our effort to create a large Multi-Layered representational
repository of Linguistic Code-Switched Arabic data. The process involves
developing clear annotation standards and Guidelines, streamlining the
annotation process, and implementing quality control measures. We used two main
protocols for annotation: in-lab gold annotations and crowd sourcing
annotations. We developed a web-based annotation tool to facilitate the
management of the annotation process. The current version of the repository
contains a total of 886,252 tokens that are tagged into one of sixteen
code-switching tags. The data exhibits code switching between Modern Standard
Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Arabic representing three data genres: Tweets,
commentaries, and discussion fora. The overall Inter-Annotator Agreement is
93.1%.
