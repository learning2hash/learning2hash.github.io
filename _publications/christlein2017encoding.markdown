The encoding of local features is an essential part for writer identification
and writer retrieval. While CNN activations have already been used as local
features in related works, the encoding of these features has attracted little
attention so far. In this work, we compare the established VLAD encoding with
triangulation embedding. We further investigate generalized max pooling as an
alternative to sum pooling and the impact of decorrelation and Exemplar SVMs.
With these techniques, we set new standards on two publicly available datasets
(ICDAR13, KHATT).
