Co-occurrence statistics based word embedding techniques have proved to be
very useful in extracting the semantic and syntactic representation of words as
low dimensional continuous vectors. In this work, we discovered that dictionary
learning can open up these word vectors as a linear combination of more
elementary word factors. We demonstrate many of the learned factors have
surprisingly strong semantic or syntactic meaning corresponding to the factors
previously identified manually by human inspection. Thus dictionary learning
provides a powerful visualization tool for understanding word embedding
representations. Furthermore, we show that the word factors can help in
identifying key semantic and syntactic differences in word analogy tasks and
improve upon the state-of-the-art word embedding techniques in these tasks by a
large margin.
