We propose Fuzzy Jaccard Index (FUJI) -- a scale-invariant score for
assessment of the similarity between two ranked/ordered lists. FUJI improves
upon the Jaccard index by incorporating a membership function which takes into
account the particular ranks, thus producing both more stable and more accurate
similarity estimates. We provide theoretical insights into the properties of
the FUJI score as well as propose an efficient algorithm for computing it. We
also present empirical evidence of its performance on different synthetic
scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in a typical machine learning
setting -- comparing feature ranking lists relevant to a given machine learning
task. In real-life, and in particular high-dimensional domains, where only a
small percentage of the whole feature space might be relevant, a robust and
confident feature ranking leads to interpretable findings as well as efficient
computation and good predictive performance. In such cases, FUJI correctly
distinguishes between existing feature ranking approaches, while being more
robust and efficient than the benchmark similarity scores.
