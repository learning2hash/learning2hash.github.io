Symbol-pair codes were proposed for the application in high density storage
systems, where it is not possible to read individual symbols. Yaakobi, Bruck
and Siegel proved that the minimum pair-distance of binary linear cyclic codes
satisfies \(d_2 \geq \lceil 3d_H/2 \rceil\) and introduced \(b\)-symbol metric
codes in 2016. In this paper covering codes in \(b\)-symbol metrics are
considered. Some examples are given to show that the Delsarte bound and the
Norse bound for covering codes in the Hamming metric are not true for covering
codes in the pair metric. We give the redundancy bound on covering radius of
linear codes in the \(b\)-symbol metric and give some optimal codes attaining
this bound. Then we prove that there is no perfect linear symbol-pair code with
the minimum pair distance \(7\) and there is no perfect \(b\)-symbol metric code if
\(b\geq \frac\{n+1\}\{2\}\). Moreover a lot of cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes
are proved non-perfect in the \(b\)-symbol metric. The covering radius of the
Reed-Solomon code in the \(b\)-symbol metric is determined. As an application the
generalized Singleton bound on the sizes of list-decodable \(b\)-symbol metric
codes is also presented. Then an upper bound on lengths of general MDS
symbol-pair codes is proved.
