Apache Spark is a popular open-source platform for large-scale data
processing that is well-suited for iterative machine learning tasks. In this
paper we present MLlib, Spark's open-source distributed machine learning
library. MLlib provides efficient functionality for a wide range of learning
settings and includes several underlying statistical, optimization, and linear
algebra primitives. Shipped with Spark, MLlib supports several languages and
provides a high-level API that leverages Spark's rich ecosystem to simplify the
development of end-to-end machine learning pipelines. MLlib has experienced a
rapid growth due to its vibrant open-source community of over 140 contributors,
and includes extensive documentation to support further growth and to let users
quickly get up to speed.
