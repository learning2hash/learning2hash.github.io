<p>In recent years, a lot of attention has been devoted to efficient
nearest neighbor search by means of similarity-preserving hashing. One
of the plights of existing hashing techniques is the intrinsic trade-off
between performance and computational complexity: while longer hash
codes allow for lower false positive rates, it is very difficult to
increase the embedding dimensionality without incurring in very high
false negatives rates or prohibiting computational costs. In this paper,
we propose a way to overcome this limitation by enforcing the hash codes
to be sparse. Sparse high-dimensional codes enjoy from the low false
positive rates typical of long hashes, while keeping the false negative
rates similar to those of a shorter dense hashing scheme with equal
number of degrees of freedom. We use a tailored feed-forward neural
network for the hashing function. Extensive experimental evaluation
involving visual and multi-modal data shows the benefits of the proposed
method.</p>
