With the arrival of convolutional neural networks, the complex problem of
food recognition has experienced an important improvement in recent years. The
best results have been obtained using methods based on very deep convolutional
neural networks, which show that the deeper the model,the better the
classification accuracy will be obtain. However, very deep neural networks may
suffer from the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a combination of
multiple classifiers based on different convolutional models that complement
each other and thus, achieve an improvement in performance. The evaluation of
our approach is done on two public datasets: Food-101 as a dataset with a wide
variety of fine-grained dishes, and Food-11 as a dataset of high-level food
categories, where our approach outperforms the independent CNN models.
