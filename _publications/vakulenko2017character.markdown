In this paper we show how the performance of tweet clustering can be improved
by leveraging character-based neural networks. The proposed approach overcomes
the limitations related to the vocabulary explosion in the word-based models
and allows for the seamless processing of the multilingual content. Our
evaluation results and code are available on-line at
