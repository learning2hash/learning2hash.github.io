This paper proposes a method for transferring the RGB color spectrum to
near-infrared (NIR) images using deep multi-scale convolutional neural
networks. A direct and integrated transfer between NIR and RGB pixels is
trained. The trained model does not require any user guidance or a reference
image database in the recall phase to produce images with a natural appearance.
To preserve the rich details of the NIR image, its high frequency features are
transferred to the estimated RGB image. The presented approach is trained and
evaluated on a real-world dataset containing a large amount of road scene
images in summer. The dataset was captured by a multi-CCD NIR/RGB camera, which
ensures a perfect pixel to pixel registration.
