Discovering emerging entities (EEs) is the problem of finding entities before
their establishment. These entities can be critical for individuals, companies,
and governments. Many of these entities can be discovered on social media
platforms, e.g. Twitter. These identities have been the spot of research in
academia and industry in recent years. Similar to any machine learning problem,
data availability is one of the major challenges in this problem. This paper
proposes EEPT. That is an online clustering method able to discover EEs without
any need for training on a dataset. Additionally, due to the lack of a proper
evaluation metric, this paper uses a new metric to evaluate the results. The
results show that EEPT is promising and finds significant entities before their
establishment.
