We present a simple \\(q\\)-gram based semi-index, which allows to look for a
pattern typically only in a small fraction of text blocks. Several space-time
tradeoffs are presented. Experiments on Pizza & Chili datasets show that our
solution is up to three orders of magnitude faster than the Claude et al.
\cite\{CNPSTjda10\} semi-index at a comparable space usage.
