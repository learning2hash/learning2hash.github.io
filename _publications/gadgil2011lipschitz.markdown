Given a metric space with a Borel probability measure, for each integer \\(N\\)
we obtain a probability distribution on \\(N\times N\\) distance matrices by
considering the distances between pairs of points in a sample consisting of \\(N\\)
points chosen indepenedently from the metric space with respect to the given
measure. We show that this gives an asymptotically bi-Lipschitz relation
between metric measure spaces and the corresponding distance matrices. This is
an effective version of a result of Vershik that metric measure spaces are
determined by associated distributions on infinite random matrices.
