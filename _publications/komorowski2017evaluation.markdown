In this paper we evaluate performance of data-dependent hashing methods on
binary data. The goal is to find a hashing method that can effectively produce
lower dimensional binary representation of 512-bit FREAK descriptors. A
representative sample of recent unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised
hashing methods was experimentally evaluated on large datasets of labelled
binary FREAK feature descriptors.
