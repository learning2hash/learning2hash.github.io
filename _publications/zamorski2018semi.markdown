In this work we introduce a novel approach to train Bidirectional Generative
Adversarial Model (BiGAN) in a semi-supervised manner. The presented method
utilizes triplet loss function as an additional component of the objective
function used to train discriminative data representation in the latent space
of the BiGAN model. This representation can be further used as a seed for
generating artificial images, but also as a good feature embedding for
classification and image retrieval tasks. We evaluate the quality of the
proposed method in the two mentioned challenging tasks using two benchmark
datasets: CIFAR10 and SVHN.
