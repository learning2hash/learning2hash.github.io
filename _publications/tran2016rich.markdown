We present an image caption system that addresses new challenges of
automatically describing images in the wild. The challenges include high
quality caption quality with respect to human judgments, out-of-domain data
handling, and low latency required in many applications. Built on top of a
state-of-the-art framework, we developed a deep vision model that detects a
broad range of visual concepts, an entity recognition model that identifies
celebrities and landmarks, and a confidence model for the caption output.
Experimental results show that our caption engine outperforms previous
state-of-the-art systems significantly on both in-domain dataset (i.e. MS COCO)
and out of-domain datasets.
