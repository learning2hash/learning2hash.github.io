We introduce SinaTools, an open-source Python package for Arabic natural
language processing and understanding. SinaTools is a unified package allowing
people to integrate it into their system workflow, offering solutions for
various tasks such as flat and nested Named Entity Recognition (NER),
fully-flagged Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), Semantic Relatedness, Synonymy
Extractions and Evaluation, Lemmatization, Part-of-speech Tagging, Root
Tagging, and additional helper utilities such as corpus processing, text
stripping methods, and diacritic-aware word matching. This paper presents
SinaTools and its benchmarking results, demonstrating that SinaTools
outperforms all similar tools on the aforementioned tasks, such as Flat NER
(87.33%), Nested NER (89.42%), WSD (82.63%), Semantic Relatedness (0.49
Spearman rank), Lemmatization (90.5%), POS tagging (97.5%), among others.
