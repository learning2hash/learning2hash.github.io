With the advances in both stable interest region detectors and robust and distinctive descriptors local feature-based image or object retrieval has become a popular research topic. All of the local feature-based image retrieval system involves two important processes local feature extraction and image representation. The other key technology for image retrieval systems is image representation such as the bag-of-visual words (BoVW) Fisher vector or Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) framework. In this paper we review local features and image representations for image retrieval. Because many and many methods are proposed in this area these methods are grouped into several classes and summarized. In addition recent deep learning-based approaches for image retrieval are briefly reviewed.
