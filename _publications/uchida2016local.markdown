With the advances in both stable interest region detectors and robust and
distinctive descriptors, local feature-based image or object retrieval has
become a popular research topic. %All of the local feature-based image
retrieval system involves two important processes: local feature extraction and
image representation. The other key technology for image retrieval systems is
image representation such as the bag-of-visual words (BoVW), Fisher vector, or
Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) framework. In this paper, we
review local features and image representations for image retrieval. Because
many and many methods are proposed in this area, these methods are grouped into
several classes and summarized. In addition, recent deep learning-based
approaches for image retrieval are briefly reviewed.
