Cryptocurrency mining processes always lead to a high energy consumption at
considerably high production cost, which is nearly one-third of cryptocurrency
(e.g. Bitcoin) price itself. As the core of mining process is based on SHA-256
cryptographic hashing function, by using the alternative quantum computers,
hybrid quantum computers or more larger quantum computing devices like quantum
annealers, it would be possible to reduce the mining energy consumption with a
quantum hardware's low-energy-operation characteristics. Within this work we
demonstrated the use of optimized quantum mining facilities which would replace
the classical SHA-256 and high energy consuming classical hardware in near
future.
