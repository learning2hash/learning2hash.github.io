The encoding representation of the genetic algorithm can boost or hinder its
performance albeit the care one can devote to operator design. Unfortunately, a
representation-theory foundation that helps to find the suitable encoding for
any problem has not yet become mature. Furthermore, we argue that such a
best-performing encoding scheme can differ even for instances of the same
problem. In this contribution, we present the basic principles of the
heterogeneous parallel genetic algorithm that federates the efforts of many
encoding representations in order to efficiently solve the problem in hand
without prior knowledge of the best encoding.
