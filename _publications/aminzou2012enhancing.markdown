In this paper, we propose an efficient digital watermarking scheme to
strengthen the security level already present in the database management system
and to avoid illegal access to comprehensive content of database including
patient's information. Doctors diagnose medical images by seeing Region of
Interest (ROI). A ROI of a medical image is an area including important
information and must be stored without any distortion. If a medical image is
illegally obtained or if its content is changed, it may lead to wrong
diagnosis. We substitute the part out of ROI of LSB bitplane of the image with
the patient data and a binary feature map. This latter is obtained by
extracting edges of the resized image to the quarter of its size using
Laplacian operator. This image is directly integrated into the database. The
edge map and invariant moments are used to check the integrity of the image.
