Ancient artworks obtained in archaeological excavations usually suffer from a
certain degree of fragmentation and physical degradation. Often, fragments of
multiple artifacts from different periods or artistic styles could be found on
the same site. With each fragment containing only partial information about its
source, and pieces from different objects being mixed, categorizing broken
artifacts based on their visual cues could be a challenging task, even for
professionals. As classification is a common function of many machine learning
models, the power of modern architectures can be harnessed for efficient and
accurate fragment classification. In this work, we present a generalized
deep-learning framework for predicting the artistic style of image fragments,
achieving state-of-the-art results for pieces with varying styles and
geometries.
