Despite the success of multimodal learning in cross-modal retrieval task, the
remarkable progress relies on the correct correspondence among multimedia data.
However, collecting such ideal data is expensive and time-consuming. In
practice, most widely used datasets are harvested from the Internet and
inevitably contain mismatched pairs. Training on such noisy correspondence
datasets causes performance degradation because the cross-modal retrieval
methods can wrongly enforce the mismatched data to be similar. To tackle this
problem, we propose a Meta Similarity Correction Network (MSCN) to provide
reliable similarity scores. We view a binary classification task as the
meta-process that encourages the MSCN to learn discrimination from positive and
negative meta-data. To further alleviate the influence of noise, we design an
effective data purification strategy using meta-data as prior knowledge to
remove the noisy samples. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate
the strengths of our method in both synthetic and real-world noises, including
Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions.
