Given two sequences over a finite alphabet \(\mathcal\{L\}\), the \(D_2\) statistic
is the number of \(m\)-letter word matches between the two sequences. This
statistic is used in bioinformatics for expressed sequence tag database
searches. Here we study a generalization of the \(D_2\) statistic in the context
of DNA sequences, under the assumption of strand symmetric Bernoulli text. For
\(k<m\), we look at the count of \(m\)-letter word matches with up to \(k\)
mismatches. For this statistic, we compute the expectation, give upper and
lower bounds for the variance and prove its distribution is asymptotically
normal.
