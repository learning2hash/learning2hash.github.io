Many different approaches for neural network based hash functions have been
proposed. Statistical analysis must correlate security of them. This paper
proposes novel neural hashing approach for gray scale image authentication. The
suggested system is rapid, robust, useful and secure. Proposed hash function
generates hash values using neural network one-way property and non-linear
techniques. As a result security and performance analysis are performed and
satisfying results are achieved. These features are dominant reasons for
preferring against traditional ones.
