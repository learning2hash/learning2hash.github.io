In this study, linear codes having their Lee-weight distributions over the
semi-local ring \\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}\\) with \\(u^\{2\}=1\\) are constructed
using the defining set and Gauss sums for an odd prime \\(q \\). Moreover, we
derive complete Hamming-weight enumerators for the images of the constructed
linear codes under the Gray map. We finally show an application to secret
sharing schemes.
