Kim et al. (2021) gave a method to embed a given binary \([n,k]\) code
\(\mathcal\{C\}\) \((k = 3, 4)\) into a self-orthogonal code of the shortest length
which has the same dimension \(k\) and minimum distance \(d' \ge d(\mathcal\{C\})\).
We extend this result by proposing a new method related to a special matrix,
called the self-orthogonality matrix \(SO_k\), obtained by shortening a
Reed-Muller code \(\mathcal R(2,k)\). Using this approach, we can extend binary
linear codes to many optimal self-orthogonal codes of dimensions \(5\) and \(6\).
Furthermore, we partially disprove the conjecture (Kim et al. (2021)) by
showing that if \(31 \le n \le 256\) and \(n\equiv 14,22,29 \pmod\{31\}\), then there
exist optimal \([n,5]\) codes which are self-orthogonal. We also construct
optimal self-orthogonal \([n,6]\) codes when \(41 \le n \le 256\) satisfies \(n \ne
46, 54, 61\) and \(n \not\equiv 7, 14, 22, 29, 38, 45, 53, 60 \pmod\{63\}\).
