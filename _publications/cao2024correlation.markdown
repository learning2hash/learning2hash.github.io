Due to its storage and query efficiency, hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search from large-scale datasets. While there is increasing interest in cross-modal hashing which facilitates cross-media retrieval by embedding data from different modalities into a common Hamming space, how to distill the cross-modal correlation structure effectively remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method, Correlation Autoencoder Hashing (CAH), to learn discriminative and compact binary codes based on deep autoencoders. Specifically, CAH jointly maximizes the feature correlation revealed by bimodal data and the semantic correlation conveyed in similarity labels, while embeds them into hash codes by nonlinear deep autoencoders. Extensive experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CAH against the state-of-the-art hashing methods on standard cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.
