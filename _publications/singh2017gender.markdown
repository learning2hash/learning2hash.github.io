Soft biometric modalities have shown their utility in different applications
including reducing the search space significantly. This leads to improved
recognition performance, reduced computation time, and faster processing of
test samples. Some common soft biometric modalities are ethnicity, gender, age,
hair color, iris color, presence of facial hair or moles, and markers. This
research focuses on performing ethnicity and gender classification on iris
images. We present a novel supervised autoencoder based approach, Deep
Class-Encoder, which uses class labels to learn discriminative representation
for the given sample by mapping the learned feature vector to its label. The
proposed model is evaluated on two datasets each for ethnicity and gender
classification. The results obtained using the proposed Deep Class-Encoder
demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing approaches and
state-of-the-art methods.
