de Bruijn sequences of order \(\ell\), i.e., sequences that contain each
\(\ell\)-tuple as a window exactly once, have found many diverse applications in
information theory and most recently in DNA storage. This family of binary
sequences has rate of \(1/2\). To overcome this low rate, we study \(\ell\)-tuples
covering sequences, which impose that each \(\ell\)-tuple appears at least once
as a window in the sequence. The cardinality of this family of sequences is
analyzed while assuming that \(\ell\) is a function of the sequence length \(n\).
Lower and upper bounds on the asymptotic rate of this family are given.
Moreover, we study an upper bound for \(\ell\) such that the redundancy of the
set of \(\ell\)-tuples covering sequences is at most a single symbol. Lastly, we
present efficient encoding and decoding schemes for \(\ell\)-tuples covering
sequences that meet this bound.
