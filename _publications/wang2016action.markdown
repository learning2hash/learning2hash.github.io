Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have shown promising
performances in many computer vision tasks, especially image-based recognition.
How to effectively use ConvNets for video-based recognition is still an open
problem. In this paper, we propose a compact, effective yet simple method to
encode spatio-temporal information carried in \(3D\) skeleton sequences into
multiple \(2D\) images, referred to as Joint Trajectory Maps (JTM), and ConvNets
are adopted to exploit the discriminative features for real-time human action
recognition. The proposed method has been evaluated on three public benchmarks,
i.e., MSRC-12 Kinect gesture dataset (MSRC-12), G3D dataset and UTD multimodal
human action dataset (UTD-MHAD) and achieved the state-of-the-art results.
