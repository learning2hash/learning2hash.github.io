We introduce a Gray map from \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}\) to
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2\}^\{2m\}\) and study \((1+u)\)-constacyclic codes over
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\},\) where \(u^\{2\}=0.\) It is proved that
the image of a \((1+u)\)-constacyclic code length \(n\) over
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}\) under the Gray map is a
distance-invariant quasi-cyclic code of index \(m\) and length \(2mn\) over
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2\}.\) We also prove that every code of length \(2mn\) which is the
Gray image of cyclic codes over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}\) of
length \(n\) is permutation equivalent to a binary quasi-cyclic code of index
\(m.\) Furthermore, a family of quantum error-correcting codes obtained from the
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction applied to \((1+u)\)-constacyclic codes
over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}+u\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^\{m\}\}.\)
