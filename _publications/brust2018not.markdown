Knowledge transfer, zero-shot learning and semantic image retrieval are
methods that aim at improving accuracy by utilizing semantic information, e.g.
from WordNet. It is assumed that this information can augment or replace
missing visual data in the form of labeled training images because semantic
similarity correlates with visual similarity. This assumption may seem trivial,
but is crucial for the application of such semantic methods. Any violation can
cause mispredictions. Thus, it is important to examine the visual-semantic
relationship for a certain target problem. In this paper, we use five different
semantic and visual similarity measures each to thoroughly analyze the
relationship without relying too much on any single definition. We postulate
and verify three highly consequential hypotheses on the relationship. Our
results show that it indeed exists and that WordNet semantic similarity carries
more information about visual similarity than just the knowledge of "different
classes look different". They suggest that classification is not the ideal
application for semantic methods and that wrong semantic information is much
worse than none.
