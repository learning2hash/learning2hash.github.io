Methods based on local image features have recently shown promise for texture
classification tasks, especially in the presence of large intra-class variation
due to illumination, scale, and viewpoint changes. Inspired by the theories of
image structure analysis, this paper presents a simple, efficient, yet robust
descriptor namely local jet pattern (LJP) for texture classification. In this
approach, a jet space representation of a texture image is derived from a set
of derivatives of Gaussian (DtGs) filter responses up to second order, so
called local jet vectors (LJV), which also satisfy the Scale Space properties.
The LJP is obtained by utilizing the relationship of center pixel with the
local neighborhood information in jet space. Finally, the feature vector of a
texture region is formed by concatenating the histogram of LJP for all elements
of LJV. All DtGs responses up to second order together preserves the intrinsic
local image structure, and achieves invariance to scale, rotation, and
reflection. This allows us to develop a texture classification framework which
is discriminative and robust. Extensive experiments on five standard texture
image databases, employing nearest subspace classifier (NSC), the proposed
descriptor achieves 100%, 99.92%, 99.75%, 99.16%, and 99.65% accuracy for
Outex_TC-00010 (Outex_TC10), and Outex_TC-00012 (Outex_TC12), KTH-TIPS,
Brodatz, CUReT, respectively, which are outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.
