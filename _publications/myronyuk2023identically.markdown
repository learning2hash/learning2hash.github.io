L. Klebanov proved the following theorem. Let \(\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n\) be
independent random variables. Consider linear forms
\(L_1=a_1\xi_1+\cdots+a_n\xi_n,\) \(L_2=b_1\xi_1+\cdots+b_n\xi_n,\)
\(L_3=c_1\xi_1+\cdots+c_n\xi_n,\) \(L_4=d_1\xi_1+\cdots+d_n\xi_n,\) where the
coefficients \(a_j, b_j, c_j, d_j\) are real numbers. If the random vectors
\((L_1,L_2)\) and \((L_3,L_4)\) are identically distributed, then all \(\xi_i\) for
which \(a_id_j-b_ic_j\neq 0\) for all \(j=\overline\{1,n\}\) are Gaussian random
variables. The present article is devoted to an analog of the Klebanov theorem
in the case when random variables take values in a locally compact Abelian
group and the coefficients of the linear forms are integers.
