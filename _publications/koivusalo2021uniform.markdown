Motivated by the random covering problem and the study of Dirichlet uniform
approximable numbers, we investigate the uniform random covering problem.
Precisely, consider an i.i.d. sequence \(\omega=(\omega_n)_\{n\geq 1\}\) uniformly
distributed on the unit circle \(\mathbb\{T\}\) and a sequence \((r_n)_\{n\geq 1\}\) of
positive real numbers with limit \(0\). We investigate the size of the random set
\[
  \mathcal U (\omega):=\\{y\in \mathbb\{T\}: \ \forall N\gg 1,
  \ \exists n \leq N, \ \text\{s.t.\} \ \| \omega_n -y \| < r_N \\}. \] Some
sufficient conditions for \(\mathcal U(\omega)\) to be almost surely the whole
space, of full Lebesgue measure, or countable, are given. In the case that
\(\mathcal U(\omega)\) is a Lebesgue null measure set, we provide some
estimations for the upper and lower bounds of Hausdorff dimension.
