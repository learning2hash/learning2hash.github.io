In this short note we introduce ResearchDoom, an implementation of the Doom
first-person shooter that can extract detailed metadata from the game. We also
introduce the CocoDoom dataset, a collection of pre-recorded data extracted
from Doom gaming sessions along with annotations in the MS Coco format.
ResearchDoom and CocoDoom can be used to train and evaluate a variety of
computer vision methods such as object recognition, detection and segmentation
at the level of instances and categories, tracking, ego-motion estimation,
monocular depth estimation and scene segmentation. The code and data are
available at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/researchdoom.
