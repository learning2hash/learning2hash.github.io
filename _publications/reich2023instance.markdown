Extracting single-cell information from microscopy data requires accurate
instance-wise segmentations. Obtaining pixel-wise segmentations from microscopy
imagery remains a challenging task, especially with the added complexity of
microstructured environments. This paper presents a novel dataset for
segmenting yeast cells in microstructures. We offer pixel-wise instance
segmentation labels for both cells and trap microstructures. In total, we
release 493 densely annotated microscopy images. To facilitate a unified
comparison between novel segmentation algorithms, we propose a standardized
evaluation strategy for our dataset. The aim of the dataset and evaluation
strategy is to facilitate the development of new cell segmentation approaches.
