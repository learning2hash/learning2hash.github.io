Existing search engines use keyword matching or tf-idf based matching to map
the query to the web-documents and rank them. They also consider other factors
such as page rank, hubs-and-authority scores, knowledge graphs to make the
results more meaningful. However, the existing search engines fail to capture
the meaning of query when it becomes large and complex. BERT, introduced by
Google in 2018, provides embeddings for words as well as sentences. In this
paper, I have developed a semantics-oriented search engine using neural
networks and BERT embeddings that can search for query and rank the documents
in the order of the most meaningful to least meaningful. The results shows
improvement over one existing search engine for complex queries for given set
of documents.
