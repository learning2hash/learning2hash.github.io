Face detection serves as a fundamental research topic for many applications
like face recognition. Impressive progress has been made especially with the
recent development of convolutional neural networks. However, the issue of
large scale variations, which widely exists in high resolution images/videos,
has not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, we present a
novel algorithm called SFace, which efficiently integrates the anchor-based
method and anchor-free method to address the scale issues. A new dataset called
4K-Face is also introduced to evaluate the performance of face detection with
extreme large scale variations. The SFace architecture shows promising results
on the new 4K-Face benchmarks. In addition, our method can run at 50 frames per
second (fps) with an accuracy of 80% AP on the standard WIDER FACE dataset,
which outperforms the state-of-art algorithms by almost one order of magnitude
in speed while achieves comparative performance.
