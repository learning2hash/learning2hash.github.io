TerraQ is a spatiotemporal question-answering engine for satellite image
archives. It is a natural language processing system that is built to process
requests for satellite images satisfying certain criteria. The requests can
refer to image metadata and entities from a specialized knowledge base (e.g.,
the Emilia-Romagna region). With it, users can make requests like "Give me a
hundred images of rivers near ports in France, with less than 20% snow coverage
and more than 10% cloud coverage", thus making Earth Observation data more
easily accessible, in-line with the current landscape of digital assistants.
