We study the problem of sampling almost uniform proper \(q\)-colourings in
\(k\)-uniform simple hypergraphs with maximum degree \(\Delta\). For any \(\delta >
0\), if \(k \geq\frac\{20(1+\delta)\}\{\delta\}\) and \(q \geq
100\Delta^\{\frac\{2+\delta\}\{k-4/\delta-4\}\}\), the running time of our algorithm
is \(\tilde\{O\}(\mathrm\{poly\}(\Delta k)\cdot n^\{1.01\})\), where \(n\) is the number
of vertices. Our result requires fewer colours than previous results for
general hypergraphs (Jain, Pham, and Voung, 2021; He, Sun, and Wu, 2021), and
does not require \(Î©(log n)\) colours unlike the work of Frieze and Anastos
(2017).
