For a \(k\)-uniform hypergraph \(\mathcal\{H\}\) on vertex set \(\\{1, ..., n\\}\) we
associate a particular signed incidence matrix \(M(\mathcal\{H\})\) over the
integers. For \(\mathcal\{H\} \sim \mathcal\{H\}_k(n, p)\) an Erd\H\{o\}s--R\'\{e\}nyi
random \(k\)-uniform hypergraph, \(\text\{coker\}(M(\mathcal\{H\}))\) is then a model
for random abelian groups. Motivated by conjectures from the study of random
simplicial complexes we show that for \(p = \omega(1/n^\{k - 1\})\),
\(\text\{coker\}(M(\mathcal\{H\}))\) is torsion-free.
