We present a method called SketchyCoreSVD to compute the near-optimal rank r
SVD of a data matrix by building random sketches only from its subsampled
columns and rows. We provide theoretical guarantees under incoherence
assumptions, and validate the performance of our SketchyCoreSVD method on
various large static and time-varying datasets.
