This note is a continuation of the author's previous work on "Sharp bounds
for the max-sliced Wasserstein distance." We use the same technique to obtain
an upper bound for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a
compactly supported symmetric probability measure on a Euclidean space and its
symmetrized empirical distribution.
