The aim of this paper is to characterize universal and multiplier
interpolating sequences for de Branges-Rovnyak spaces H (b) where the defining
function b is a general non-extreme rational function. Our results carry over
to recently introduced higher order local Dirichlet spaces and thus generalize
previously known results in classical local Dirichlet spaces. In this setting,
we also investigate random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii,
providing a 0 -1 law. This condition is automatic when b is rational non inner
so that we can assume H (b) = M(a). By standard results in functional analysis,
the corresponding norms are equivalent. In [18], the authors demonstrated that
the decomposition (1) is orthogonal in the metric of M(a).
