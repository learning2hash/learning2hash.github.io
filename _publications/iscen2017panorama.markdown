Location recognition is commonly treated as visual instance retrieval on
"street view" imagery. The dataset items and queries are panoramic views, i.e.
groups of images taken at a single location. This work introduces a novel
panorama-to-panorama matching process, either by aggregating features of
individual images in a group or by explicitly constructing a larger panorama.
In either case, multiple views are used as queries. We reach near perfect
location recognition on a standard benchmark with only four query views.
