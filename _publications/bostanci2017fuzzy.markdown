Matching of binary image features is an important step in many different
computer vision applications. Conventionally, an arbitrary threshold is used to
identify a correct match from incorrect matches using Hamming distance which
may improve or degrade the matching results for different input images. This is
mainly due to the image content which is affected by the scene, lighting and
imaging conditions. This paper presents a fuzzy logic based approach for brute
force matching of image features to overcome this situation. The method was
tested using a well-known image database with known ground truth. The approach
is shown to produce a higher number of correct matches when compared against
constant distance thresholds. The nature of fuzzy logic which allows the
vagueness of information and tolerance to errors has been successfully
exploited in an image processing context. The uncertainty arising from the
imaging conditions has been overcome with the use of compact fuzzy matching
membership functions.
