Children's drawings have a wonderful inventiveness, creativity, and variety
to them. We present a system that automatically animates children's drawings of
the human figure, is robust to the variance inherent in these depictions, and
is simple and straightforward enough for anyone to use. We demonstrate the
value and broad appeal of our approach by building and releasing the Animated
Drawings Demo, a freely available public website that has been used by millions
of people around the world. We present a set of experiments exploring the
amount of training data needed for fine-tuning, as well as a perceptual study
demonstrating the appeal of a novel twisted perspective retargeting technique.
Finally, we introduce the Amateur Drawings Dataset, a first-of-its-kind
annotated dataset, collected via the public demo, containing over 178,000
amateur drawings and corresponding user-accepted character bounding boxes,
segmentation masks, and joint location annotations.
