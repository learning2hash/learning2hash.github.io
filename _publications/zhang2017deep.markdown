As the rapid growth of multi45;modal data hashing methods for cross45;modal retrieval have received considerable attention. Deep45;networks45;based cross45;modal hashing methods are appealing as they can integrate feature learning and hash coding into end45;to45;end trainable frameworks. However it is still challenging to find content similarities between different modalities of data due to the heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem we propose an adversarial hashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi45;modal data. The proposed new adversarial network HashGAN consists of three building blocks 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations 2) the generative attention module to generate an attention mask which is used to obtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature representations 3) the discriminative hash coding module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in an adversarial way the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot preserve the similarities of multi45;modal data w.r.t. the background feature representations while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of multi45;modal data w.r.t. both the foreground and the background feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over other state45;of45;the45;art cross45;modal hashing methods.
