In this paper we propose a novel texture descriptor called Fractal Weighted
Local Binary Pattern (FWLBP). The fractal dimension (FD) measure is relatively
invariant to scale-changes, and presents a good correlation with human
viewpoint of surface roughness. We have utilized this property to construct a
scale-invariant descriptor. Here, the input image is sampled using an augmented
form of the local binary pattern (LBP) over three different radii, and then
used an indexing operation to assign FD weights to the collected samples. The
final histogram of the descriptor has its features calculated using LBP, and
its weights computed from the FD image. The proposed descriptor is scale
invariant, and is also robust in rotation or reflection, and partially tolerant
to noise and illumination changes. In addition, the local fractal dimension is
relatively insensitive to the bi-Lipschitz transformations, whereas its
extension is adequate to precisely discriminate the fundamental of texture
primitives. Experiment results carried out on standard texture databases show
that the proposed descriptor achieved better classification rates compared to
the state-of-the-art descriptors.
