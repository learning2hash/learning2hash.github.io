In this paper we examine the existence of correlation between movie
similarity and low level features from respective movie content. In particular,
we demonstrate the extraction of multi-modal representation models of movies
based on subtitles, audio and metadata mining. We emphasize our research in
topic modeling of movies based on their subtitles. In order to demonstrate the
proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160
widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the
singular modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation rankings.
We showcase a novel topic model browser for movies that allows for exploration
of the different aspects of similarities between movies and an information
retrieval system for movie similarity based on multi-modal content.
