The lack of wide coverage datasets annotated with everyday metaphorical
expressions for languages other than English is striking. This means that most
research on supervised metaphor detection has been published only for that
language. In order to address this issue, this work presents the first corpus
annotated with naturally occurring metaphors in Spanish large enough to develop
systems to perform metaphor detection. The presented dataset, CoMeta, includes
texts from various domains, namely, news, political discourse, Wikipedia and
reviews. In order to label CoMeta, we apply the MIPVU method, the guidelines
most commonly used to systematically annotate metaphor on real data. We use our
newly created dataset to provide competitive baselines by fine-tuning several
multilingual and monolingual state-of-the-art large language models.
Furthermore, by leveraging the existing VUAM English data in addition to
CoMeta, we present the, to the best of our knowledge, first cross-lingual
experiments on supervised metaphor detection. Finally, we perform a detailed
error analysis that explores the seemingly high transfer of everyday metaphor
across these two languages and datasets.
