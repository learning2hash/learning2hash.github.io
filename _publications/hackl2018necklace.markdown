The "necklace process", a procedure constructing necklaces of black and white
beads by randomly choosing positions to insert new beads (whose color is
uniquely determined based on the chosen location), is revisited. This article
illustrates how, after deriving the corresponding bivariate probability
generating function, the characterization of the asymptotic limiting
distribution of the number of beads of a given color follows as a
straightforward consequence within the analytic combinatorics framework.
