This paper proposes a novel approach towards image authentication and
tampering detection by using watermarking as a communication channel for
semantic information. We modify the HiDDeN deep-learning watermarking
architecture to embed and extract high-dimensional real vectors representing
image captions. Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and
benign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with
Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This
approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic
methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.
