Color based re-identification methods usually rely on a distance function to
measure the similarity between individuals. In this paper we study the behavior
of several histogram distance measures in different color spaces. We wonder
whether there is a particular histogram distance measure better than others,
likewise also, if there is a color space that present better discrimination
features. Several experiments are designed and evaluated in several images to
obtain measures against various color spaces. We test in several image
databases. A measure ranking is generated to calculate the area under the CMC,
this area is the indicator used to evaluate which distance measure and color
space present the best performance for the considered databases. Also, other
parameters such as the image division in horizontal stripes and number of
histogram bins, have been studied.
