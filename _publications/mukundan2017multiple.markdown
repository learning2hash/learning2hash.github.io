We propose a multiple-kernel local-patch descriptor based on efficient match
kernels of patch gradients. It combines two parametrizations of gradient
position and direction, each parametrization provides robustness to a different
type of patch miss-registration: polar parametrization for noise in the patch
dominant orientation detection, Cartesian for imprecise location of the feature
point. Even though handcrafted, the proposed method consistently outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on two local patch benchmarks.
