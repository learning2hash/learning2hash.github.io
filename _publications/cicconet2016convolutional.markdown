We present a convolutional approach to reflection symmetry detection in 2D.
Our model, built on the products of complex-valued wavelet convolutions,
simplifies previous edge-based pairwise methods. Being parameter-centered, as
opposed to feature-centered, it has certain computational advantages when the
object sizes are known a priori, as demonstrated in an ellipse detection
application. The method outperforms the best-performing algorithm on the CVPR
2013 Symmetry Detection Competition Database in the single-symmetry case. Code
and a new database for 2D symmetry detection is available.
