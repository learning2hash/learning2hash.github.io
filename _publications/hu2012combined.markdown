Recently spatial pyramid matching (SPM) with scale invariant feature transform
(SIFT) descriptor has been successfully used in image classification.
Unfortunately, the codebook generation and feature quantization procedures using
SIFT feature have the high complexity both in time and space. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose an approach which combines local binary
patterns (LBP) and three-patch local binary patterns (TPLBP) in spatial pyramid
domain. The proposed method does not need to learn the codebook and feature
quantization processing, hence it becomes very efficient. Experiments on two
popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method always
significantly outperforms the very popular SPM based SIFT descriptor method both
in time and classification accuracy.
