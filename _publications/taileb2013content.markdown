    Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been one of the most important research areas in computer vision. It is a widely used method for searching images in huge databases. In this paper we present a CBIR system called NOHIS-Search. The system is based on the indexing technique NOHIS-tree. The two phases of the system are described and the performance of the system is illustrated with the image database ImagEval. NOHIS-Search system was compared to other two CBIR systems; the first that using PDDP indexing algorithm and the second system is that using the sequential search. Results show that NOHIS-Search system outperforms the two other systems.
