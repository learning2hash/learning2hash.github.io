Given a single photo of a room and a large database of furniture CAD models,
our goal is to reconstruct a scene that is as similar as possible to the scene
depicted in the photograph, and composed of objects drawn from the database. We
present a completely automatic system to address this IM2CAD problem that
produces high quality results on challenging imagery from interior home design
and remodeling websites. Our approach iteratively optimizes the placement and
scale of objects in the room to best match scene renderings to the input photo,
using image comparison metrics trained via deep convolutional neural nets. By
operating jointly on the full scene at once, we account for inter-object
occlusions. We also show the applicability of our method in standard scene
understanding benchmarks where we obtain significant improvement.
