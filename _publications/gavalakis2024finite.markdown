We review old and recent finite de Finetti theorems in total variation
distance and in relative entropy, and we highlight their connections with
bounds on the difference between sampling with and without replacement. We also
establish two new finite de Finetti theorems for exchangeable random vectors
taking values in arbitrary spaces. These bounds are tight, and they are
independent of the size and the dimension of the underlying space.
