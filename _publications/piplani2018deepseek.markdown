Most of the internet today is composed of digital media that includes videos
and images. With pixels becoming the currency in which most transactions happen
on the internet, it is becoming increasingly important to have a way of
browsing through this ocean of information with relative ease. YouTube has 400
hours of video uploaded every minute and many million images are browsed on
Instagram, Facebook, etc. Inspired by recent advances in the field of deep
learning and success that it has gained on various problems like image
captioning and, machine translation , word2vec , skip thoughts, etc, we present
DeepSeek a natural language processing based deep learning model that allows
users to enter a description of the kind of images that they want to search,
and in response the system retrieves all the images that semantically and
contextually relate to the query. Two approaches are described in the following
sections.
