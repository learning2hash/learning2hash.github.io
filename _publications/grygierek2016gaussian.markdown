Consider a stationary Poisson point process in \\(\mathbb\{R\}^d\\) and connect any
two points whenever their distance is less than or equal to a prescribed
distance parameter. This construction gives rise to the well known random
geometric graph. The number of edges of this graph is counted that have
midpoint in the \\(d\\)-dimensional unit ball. A quantitative central limit theorem
for this counting statistic is derived, as the space dimension \\(d\\) and the
intensity of the Poisson point process tend to infinity simultaneously.
