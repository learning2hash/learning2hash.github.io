In this work, we tackle the problem of car license plate detection and
recognition in natural scene images. We propose a unified deep neural network
which can localize license plates and recognize the letters simultaneously in a
single forward pass. The whole network can be trained end-to-end. In contrast
to existing approaches which take license plate detection and recognition as
two separate tasks and settle them step by step, our method jointly solves
these two tasks by a single network. It not only avoids intermediate error
accumulation, but also accelerates the processing speed. For performance
evaluation, three datasets including images captured from various scenes under
different conditions are tested. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness
and efficiency of our proposed approach.
