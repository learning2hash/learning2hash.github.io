This paper aims to develop the study of historical printed ornaments with
modern unsupervised computer vision. We highlight three complex tasks that are
of critical interest to book historians: clustering, element discovery, and
unsupervised change localization. For each of these tasks, we introduce an
evaluation benchmark, and we adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art models. Our
Rey's Ornaments dataset is designed to be a representative example of a set of
ornaments historians would be interested in. It focuses on an XVIIIth century
bookseller, Marc-Michel Rey, providing a consistent set of ornaments with a
wide diversity and representative challenges. Our results highlight the
limitations of state-of-the-art models when faced with real data and show
simple baselines such as k-means or congealing can outperform more
sophisticated approaches on such data. Our dataset and code can be found at
