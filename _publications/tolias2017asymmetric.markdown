We propose a novel concept of asymmetric feature maps (AFM), which allows to
evaluate multiple kernels between a query and database entries without
increasing the memory requirements. To demonstrate the advantages of the AFM
method, we derive a short vector image representation that, due to asymmetric
feature maps, supports efficient scale and translation invariant sketch-based
image retrieval. Unlike most of the short-code based retrieval systems, the
proposed method provides the query localization in the retrieved image. The
efficiency of the search is boosted by approximating a 2D translation search
via trigonometric polynomial of scores by 1D projections. The projections are a
special case of AFM. An order of magnitude speed-up is achieved compared to
traditional trigonometric polynomials. The results are boosted by an
image-based average query expansion, exceeding significantly the state of the
art on standard benchmarks.
