Performing machine learning on structured data is complicated by the fact
that such data does not have vectorial form. Therefore, multiple approaches
have emerged to construct vectorial representations of structured data, from
kernel and distance approaches to recurrent, recursive, and convolutional
neural networks. Recent years have seen heightened attention in this demanding
field of research and several new approaches have emerged, such as metric
learning on structured data, graph convolutional neural networks, and recurrent
decoder networks for structured data. In this contribution, we provide an
high-level overview of the state-of-the-art in representation learning and
embeddings for structured data across a wide range of machine learning fields.
