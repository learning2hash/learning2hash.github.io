With the rise of internet technology amidst increasing rates of urbanization,
sharing information has never been easier thanks to globally-adopted platforms
for digital communication. The resulting output of massive amounts of
user-generated data can be used to enhance our understanding of significant
societal issues particularly for urbanizing areas. In order to better analyze
protest behavior, we enhanced the GSR dataset and manually labeled all the
images. We used deep learning techniques to analyze social media data to detect
social unrest through image classification, which performed good in predict
multi-attributes, then also used map visualization to display protest behaviors
across the country.
