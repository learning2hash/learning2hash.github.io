In this article we present a statistical version of the Candes-Tao restricted
isometry property (SRIP for short) which holds in general for any incoherent
dictionary which is a disjoint union of orthonormal bases. In addition, under
appropriate normalization, the eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix
fluctuate around 1 according to the Wigner semicircle distribution. The result
is then applied to various dictionaries that arise naturally in the setting of
finite harmonic analysis, giving, in particular, a better understanding on a
remark of Applebaum-Howard-Searle-Calderbank concerning RIP for the Heisenberg
dictionary of chirp like functions.
