Hashing based Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) search has attracted much attention
due to its fast query time and drastically
reduced storage. However, most of the hashing
methods either use random projections or
extract principal directions from the data to
derive hash functions. The resulting embedding
suffers from poor discrimination when
compact codes are used. In this paper, we
propose a novel data-dependent projection
learning method such that each hash function
is designed to correct the errors made by
the previous one sequentially. The proposed
method easily adapts to both unsupervised
and semi-supervised scenarios and shows significant
performance gains over the state-ofthe-art
methods on two large datasets containing
up to 1 million points.
