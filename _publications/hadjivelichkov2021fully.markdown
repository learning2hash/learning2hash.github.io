We address the problem of inferring self-supervised dense semantic
correspondences between objects in multi-object scenes. The method introduces
learning of class-aware dense object descriptors by providing either
unsupervised discrete labels or confidence in object similarities. We
quantitatively and qualitatively show that the introduced method outperforms
previous techniques with more robust pixel-to-pixel matches. An example robotic
application is also shown~- grasping of objects in clutter based on
corresponding points.
