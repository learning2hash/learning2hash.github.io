Hashing is very popular for remote sensing image search. This article proposes a
multiview hashing with learnable parameters to retrieve the queried images for a
large-scale remote sensing dataset. Existing methods always neglect that real-
world remote sensing data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-
dimensional ambient space. Unlike previous methods, this article proposes to
learn the consensus compact codes in a view-specific low-dimensional subspace.
Furthermore, we have added a hyperparameter learnable module to avoid complex
parameter tuning. In order to prove the effectiveness of our method, we carried
out experiments on three widely used remote sensing data sets and compared them
with seven state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed method can achieve competitive results compared to the other method.
