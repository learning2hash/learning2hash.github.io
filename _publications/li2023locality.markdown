Hashing is very popular for remote sensing image search. This article
proposes a multiview hashing with learnable parameters to retrieve the queried
images for a large-scale remote sensing dataset. Existing methods always
neglect that real-world remote sensing data lies on a low-dimensional manifold
embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. Unlike previous methods, this
article proposes to learn the consensus compact codes in a view-specific
low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, we have added a hyperparameter learnable
module to avoid complex parameter tuning. In order to prove the effectiveness
of our method, we carried out experiments on three widely used remote sensing
data sets and compared them with seven state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results
compared to the other method.
