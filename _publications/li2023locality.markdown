Hashing is very popular for remote sensing image search. This article proposes a multiview hashing with learnable parameters to retrieve the queried images for a large45;scale remote sensing dataset. Existing methods always neglect that real45;world remote sensing data lies on a low45;dimensional manifold embedded in high45;dimensional ambient space. Unlike previous methods this article proposes to learn the consensus compact codes in a view45;specific low45;dimensional subspace. Furthermore we have added a hyperparameter learnable module to avoid complex parameter tuning. In order to prove the effectiveness of our method we carried out experiments on three widely used remote sensing data sets and compared them with seven state45;of45;the45;art methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results compared to the other method.
