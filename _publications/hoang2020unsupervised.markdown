This paper presents a novel framework, namely Deep Cross-modality Spectral
Hashing (DCSH), to tackle the unsupervised learning problem of binary hash
codes for efficient cross-modal retrieval. The framework is a two-step hashing
approach which decouples the optimization into (1) binary optimization and (2)
hashing function learning. In the first step, we propose a novel spectral
embedding-based algorithm to simultaneously learn single-modality and binary
cross-modality representations. While the former is capable of well preserving
the local structure of each modality, the latter reveals the hidden patterns
from all modalities. In the second step, to learn mapping functions from
informative data inputs (images and word embeddings) to binary codes obtained
from the first step, we leverage the powerful CNN for images and propose a
CNN-based deep architecture to learn text modality. Quantitative evaluations on
three standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DCSH method
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
