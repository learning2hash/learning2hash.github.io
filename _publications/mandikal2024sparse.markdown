Traditional information retrieval is based on sparse bag-of-words vector
representations of documents and queries. More recent deep-learning approaches
have used dense embeddings learned using a transformer-based large language
model. We show that on a classic benchmark on scientific document retrieval in
the medical domain of cystic fibrosis, that both of these models perform
roughly equivalently. Notably, dense vectors from the state-of-the-art SPECTER2
model do not significantly enhance performance. However, a hybrid model that we
propose combining these methods yields significantly better results,
underscoring the merits of integrating classical and contemporary deep learning
techniques in information retrieval in the domain of specialized scientific
documents.
