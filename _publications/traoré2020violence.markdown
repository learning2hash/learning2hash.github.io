Violence and abnormal behavior detection research have known an increase of
interest in recent years, due mainly to a rise in crimes in large cities
worldwide. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture for violence
detection which combines both recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNN). In addition to video
frames, we use optical flow computed using the captured sequences. CNN extracts
spatial characteristics in each frame, while RNN extracts temporal
characteristics. The use of optical flow allows to encode the movements in the
scenes. The proposed approaches reach the same level as the state-of-the-art
techniques and sometime surpass them. It was validated on 3 databases achieving
good results.
