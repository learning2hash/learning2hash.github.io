We study codes that can detect the exact number of deletions and insertions
in concatenated binary strings. We construct optimal codes for the case of
detecting up to \(\del\) deletions. We prove the optimality of these codes by
deriving a converse result which shows that the redundancy of our codes is
asymptotically optimal in \(\del\) among all families of deletion detecting
codes, and particularly optimal among all block-by-block decodable codes. For
the case of insertions, we construct codes that can detect up to \(2\) insertions
in each concatenated binary string.
