Recent studies show that large45;scale sketch45;based image retrieval (SBIR) can be efficiently tackled by cross45;modal binary representation learning methods where Hamming distance matching significantly speeds up the process of similarity search. Providing training and test data subjected to a fixed set of pre45;defined categories the cutting45;edge SBIR and cross45;modal hashing works obtain acceptable retrieval performance. However most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero45;shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero45;shot sketch45;image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end45;to45;end three45;network architecture is built two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch45;image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution respectively. As an important part of ZSIH we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero45;shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge ZSIH is the first zero45;shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross45;modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets i.e. Sketchy and TU45;Berlin with a novel zero45;shot train45;test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works.
