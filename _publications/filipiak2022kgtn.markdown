We propose KGTN-ens, a framework extending the recent Knowledge Graph
Transfer Network (KGTN) in order to incorporate multiple knowledge graph
embeddings at a small cost. We evaluate it with different combinations of
embeddings in a few-shot image classification task. We also construct a new
knowledge source - Wikidata embeddings - and evaluate it with KGTN and
KGTN-ens. Our approach outperforms KGTN in terms of the top-5 accuracy on the
ImageNet-FS dataset for the majority of tested settings.
