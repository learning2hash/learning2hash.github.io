This paper proposes a novel entropy encoding technique for lossless data
compression. Representing a message string by its lexicographic index in the
permutations of its symbols results in a compressed version matching Shannon
entropy of the message. Commercial data compression standards make use of
Huffman or arithmetic coding at some stage of the compression process. In the
proposed method, like arithmetic coding entire string is mapped to an integer
but is not based on fractional numbers. Unlike both arithmetic and Huffman
coding no prior entropy model of the source is required. Simple intuitive
algorithm based on multinomial coefficients is developed for entropy encoding
that adoptively uses low number of bits for more frequent symbols. Correctness
of the algorithm is demonstrated by an example.
