This research proposes a practical method for detecting featureless objects
by using image alignment approach with a robust similarity measure in
industrial applications. This similarity measure is robust against occlusion,
illumination changes and background clutter. The performance of the proposed
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) accelerated algorithm is deemed successful in
experiments of comparison between both CPU and GPU implementations
