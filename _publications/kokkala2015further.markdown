A \\(q\\)-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) code \\(C\\) with length \\(n\\),
dimension \\(k\\) over an alphabet \\(\mathcal\{A\}\\) of size \\(q\\) is a set of \\(q^k\\)
codewords that are elements of \\(\mathcal\{A\}^n\\), such that the Hamming distance
between two distinct codewords in \\(C\\) is at least \\(n-k+1\\). Sets of mutually
orthogonal Latin squares of orders \\(q\leq 9\\), corresponding to two-dimensional
\mbox\{\\(q\\)-\}ary MDS codes, and \\(q\\)-ary one-error-correcting MDS codes for \\(q\leq
8\\) have been classified in earlier studies. These results are used here to
complete the classification of all \\(7\\)-ary and \\(8\\)-ary MDS codes with \\(d\geq 3\\)
using a computer search.
