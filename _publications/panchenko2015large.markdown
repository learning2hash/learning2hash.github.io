A profile matching algorithm takes as input a user profile of one social
network and returns, if existing, the profile of the same person in another
social network. Such methods have immediate applications in Internet marketing,
search, security, and a number of other domains, which is why this topic saw a
recent surge in popularity. In this paper, we present a user identity
resolution approach that uses minimal supervision and achieves a precision of
0.98 at a recall of 0.54. Furthermore, the method is computationally efficient
and easily parallelizable. We show that the method can be used to match
Facebook, the most popular social network globally, with VKontakte, the most
popular social network among Russian-speaking users.
