We define new families of Tillich-Z\'emor hash functions, using higher
dimensional special linear groups over finite fields as platforms. The Cayley
graphs of these groups combine fast mixing properties and high girth, which
together give rise to good preimage and collision resistance of the
corresponding hash functions. We justify the claim that the resulting hash
functions are post-quantum secure.
