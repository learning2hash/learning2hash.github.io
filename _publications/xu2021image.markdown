We propose a way of learning disentangled content-style representation of
image, allowing us to extrapolate images to any style as well as interpolate
between any pair of styles. By augmenting data set in a supervised setting and
imposing triplet loss, we ensure the separation of information encoded by
content and style representation. We also make use of cycle-consistency loss to
guarantee that images could be reconstructed faithfully by their
representation.
