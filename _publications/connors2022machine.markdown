The increasing number of sophisticated malware poses a major cybersecurity
threat. Portable executable (PE) files are a common vector for such malware. In
this work we review and evaluate machine learning-based PE malware detection
techniques. Using a large benchmark dataset, we evaluate features of PE files
using the most common machine learning techniques to detect malware.
