Consider a stationary Poisson process \\(\eta\\) in the \\(d\\)-dimensional Euclidean
or hyperbolic space and construct a random graph with vertex set \\(\eta\\) as
follows. First, each point \\(x\in\eta\\) is connected by an edge to its nearest
neighbour, then to its second nearest neighbour and so on, until \\(x\\) is
contained in the convex hull of the points already connected to \\(x\\). The
resulting random graph is the so-called nearest neighbour embracing graph. The
main result of this paper is a quantitative description of the Gaussian
fluctuations of geometric functionals associated with the nearest neighbour
embracing graph. More precisely, the total edge length, more general
length-power functionals and the number of vertices with given outdegree are
considered.
