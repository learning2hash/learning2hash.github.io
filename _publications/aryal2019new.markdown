To measure the similarity of two documents in the bag-of-words (BoW) vector
representation, different term weighting schemes are used to improve the
performance of cosine similarity---the most widely used inter-document
similarity measure in text mining. In this paper, we identify the shortcomings
of the underlying assumptions of term weighting in the inter-document
similarity measurement task; and provide a more fit-to-the-purpose alternative.
Based on this new assumption, we introduce a new simple but effective
similarity measure which does not require explicit term weighting. The proposed
measure employs a more nuanced probabilistic approach than those used in term
weighting to measure the similarity of two documents w.r.t each term occurring
in the two documents. Our empirical comparison with the existing similarity
measures using different term weighting schemes shows that the new measure
produces (i) better results in the binary BoW representation; and (ii)
competitive and more consistent results in the term-frequency-based BoW
representation.
