A locally uniform random permutation is generated by sampling \\(n\\) points
independently from some absolutely continuous distribution \\(\rho\\) on the plane
and interpreting them as a permutation by the rule that \\(i\\) maps to \\(j\\) if the
\\(i\\)th point from the left is the \\(j\\)th point from below. As \\(n\\) tends to
infinity, decreasing subsequences in the permutation will appear as curves in
the plane, and by interpreting these as level curves, a union of decreasing
subsequences give rise to a surface. We show that, under the correct scaling,
for any \\(r\ge0\\), the largest union of \\(\lfloor r\sqrt\{n\}\rfloor\\) decreasing
subsequences approaches a limit surface as \\(n\\) tends to infinity, and the limit
surface is a solution to a specific variational problem. As a corollary, we
prove the existence of a limit shape for the Young diagram associated to the
random permutation under the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. In the special
case where \\(\rho\\) is the uniform distribution on the diamond \\(|x|+|y|<1\\) we
conjecture that the limit shape is triangular, and assuming the conjecture is
true we find an explicit formula for the limit surfaces of a uniformly random
permutation and recover the famous limit shape of Vershik, Kerov and Logan,
Shepp.
