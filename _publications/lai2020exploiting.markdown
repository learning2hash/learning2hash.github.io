The existing event classification (EC) work primarily focuseson the
traditional supervised learning setting in which models are unableto extract
event mentions of new/unseen event types. Few-shot learninghas not been
investigated in this area although it enables EC models toextend their
operation to unobserved event types. To fill in this gap, inthis work, we
investigate event classification under the few-shot learningsetting. We propose
a novel training method for this problem that exten-sively exploit the support
set during the training process of a few-shotlearning model. In particular, in
addition to matching the query exam-ple with those in the support set for
training, we seek to further matchthe examples within the support set
themselves. This method providesmore training signals for the models and can be
applied to every metric-learning-based few-shot learning methods. Our extensive
experiments ontwo benchmark EC datasets show that the proposed method can
improvethe best reported few-shot learning models by up to 10% on accuracyfor
