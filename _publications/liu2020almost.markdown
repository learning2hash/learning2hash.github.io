In this work, we introduce a natural notion concerning finite vector spaces.
A family of \\(k\\)-dimensional subspaces of \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\), which forms a
partial spread, is called almost affinely disjoint if any \\((k+1)\\)-dimensional
subspace containing a subspace from the family non-trivially intersects with
only a few subspaces from the family. The central question discussed in the
paper is the polynomial growth (in \\(q\\)) of the maximal cardinality of these
families given the parameters \\(k\\) and \\(n\\). For the cases \\(k=1\\) and \\(k=2\\),
optimal families are constructed. For other settings, we find lower and upper
bounds on the polynomial growth. Additionally, some connections with problems
in coding theory are shown.
