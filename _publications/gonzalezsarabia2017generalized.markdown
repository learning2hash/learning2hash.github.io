Using commutative algebra methods we study the generalized minimum distance
function (gmd function) and the corresponding generalized footprint function of
a graded ideal in a polynomial ring over a field. The number of solutions that
a system of homogeneous polynomials has in any given finite set of projective
points is expressed as the degree of a graded ideal. If \\(\mathbb\{X\}\\) is a set
of projective points over a finite field and \\(I\\) is its vanishing ideal, we
show that the gmd function and the Vasconcelos function of \\(I\\) are equal to the
\\(r\\)-th generalized Hamming weight of the corresponding Reed-Muller-type code
\\(C_\mathbb\{X\}(d)\\) of degree \\(d\\). We show that the generalized footprint
function of \\(I\\) is a lower bound for the \\(r\\)-th generalized Hamming weight of
\\(C_\mathbb\{X\}(d)\\). Then we present some applications to projective nested
cartesian codes. To give applications of our lower bound to algebraic coding
theory, we show an interesting integer inequality. Then we show an explicit
formula and a combinatorial formula for the second generalized Hamming weight
of an affine cartesian code.
