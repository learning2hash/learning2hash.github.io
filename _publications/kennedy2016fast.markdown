We provide a variant of cross45;polytope locality sensitive hashing with respect to angular distance which is provably optimal in asymptotic sensitivity and enjoys mathcal123;O125;(d ln d ) hash computation time. Building on a recent result (by Andoni Indyk Laarhoven Razenshteyn Schmidt 2015) we show that optimal asymptotic sensitivity for cross45;polytope LSH is retained even when the dense Gaussian matrix is replaced by a fast Johnson45;Lindenstrauss transform followed by discrete pseudo45;rotation reducing the hash computation time from mathcal123;O125;(d^2) to mathcal123;O125;(d ln d ). Moreover our scheme achieves the optimal rate of convergence for sensitivity. By incorporating a low45;randomness Johnson45;Lindenstrauss transform our scheme can be modified to require only mathcal123;O125;(ln^9(d)) random bits
