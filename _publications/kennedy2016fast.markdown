We provide a variant of cross-polytope locality sensitive hashing with respect to angular distance which is provably optimal in asymptotic sensitivity and enjoys (d ln d ) hash computation time. Building on a recent result (by Andoni Indyk Laarhoven Razenshteyn Schmidt 2015) we show that optimal asymptotic sensitivity for cross-polytope LSH is retained even when the dense Gaussian matrix is replaced by a fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform followed by discrete pseudo-rotation reducing the hash computation time from (d^2) to (d ln d ). Moreover our scheme achieves the optimal rate of convergence for sensitivity. By incorporating a low-randomness Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform our scheme can be modified to require only (ln^9(d)) random bits
