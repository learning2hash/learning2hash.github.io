Self-dual double circulant codes of odd dimension are shown to be dihedral in
even characteristic and consta-dihedral in odd characteristic. Exact counting
formulae are derived for them and used to show they contain families of codes
with relative distance satisfying a modified Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
