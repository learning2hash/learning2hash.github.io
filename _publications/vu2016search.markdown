Recent research has shown that the performance of search personalization
depends on the richness of user profiles which normally represent the user's
topical interests. In this paper, we propose a new embedding approach to
learning user profiles, where users are embedded on a topical interest space.
We then directly utilize the user profiles for search personalization.
Experiments on query logs from a major commercial web search engine demonstrate
that our embedding approach improves the performance of the search engine and
also achieves better search performance than other strong baselines.
