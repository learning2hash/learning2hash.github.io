Let \(p\) be an odd prime number. In this paper, we construct \(2(2p-3)\) classes
of codes over the ring \(R=\Bbb F_p+u\Bbb F_p,u^2=0\), which are associated with
down sets. We compute the Lee weight distributions of the \(2(2p-3)\) classes of
codes when the down sets are generated by a single maximal element. Moreover,
by using the Gray map of the linear codes over \(R\), we find out \(2(p-1)\)
classes of \(p\)-ary distance optimal linear codes. Two of them meet the Griesmer
bound.
