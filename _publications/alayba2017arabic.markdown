The social media network phenomenon leads to a massive amount of valuable
data that is available online and easy to access. Many users share images,
videos, comments, reviews, news and opinions on different social networks
sites, with Twitter being one of the most popular ones. Data collected from
Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets
is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly
post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a
lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and
datasets in Arabic language is limited. This paper introduces an Arabic
language dataset which is about opinions on health services and has been
collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting
the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and
annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset
in Arabic. Several Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector
Machine and Logistic Regression) alongside Deep and Convolutional Neural
Networks were utilized in our experiments of sentiment analysis on our health
dataset.
