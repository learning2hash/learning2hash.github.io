<p>We consider the task of nearest-neighbor search with the class of
binary-space-partitioning trees, which includes kd-trees, principal axis
trees and random projection trees, and try to rigorously answer the
question which tree to use for nearest-neighbor search?’’ To this end,
we present the theoretical results which imply that trees with better
vector quantization performance have better search performance
guarantees. We also explore another factor affecting the search
performance – margins of the partitions in these trees. We demonstrate,
both theoretically and empirically, that large margin partitions can
improve the search performance of a space-partitioning tree. ”</p>
