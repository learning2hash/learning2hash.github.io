We introduce whatlies, an open source toolkit for visually inspecting word
and sentence embeddings. The project offers a unified and extensible API with
current support for a range of popular embedding backends including spaCy,
tfhub, huggingface transformers, gensim, fastText and BytePair embeddings. The
package combines a domain specific language for vector arithmetic with
visualisation tools that make exploring word embeddings more intuitive and
concise. It offers support for many popular dimensionality reduction techniques
as well as many interactive visualisations that can either be statically
exported or shared via Jupyter notebooks. The project documentation is
available from https://rasahq.github.io/whatlies/.
