There have thousands of crimes are happening daily all around. But people
keep statistics only few of them, therefore crime rates are increasing day by
day. The reason behind can be less concern or less statistics of previous
crimes. It is much more important to observe the previous crime statistics for
general people to make their outing decision and police for catching the
criminals are taking steps to restrain the crimes and tourists to make their
travelling decision. National institute of justice releases crime survey data
for the country, but does not offer crime statistics up to Union or Thana
level. Considering all of these cases we have come up with an approach which
can give an approximation to people about the safety of a specific location
with crime ranking of different areas locating the crimes on a map including a
future crime occurrence prediction mechanism. Our approach relies on different
online Bangla newspapers for crawling the crime data, stemming and keyword
extraction, location finding algorithm, cosine similarity, naive Bayes
classifier, and a custom crime prediction model
