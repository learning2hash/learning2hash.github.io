We consider connected components in \\(k\\)-uniform hypergraphs for the following
notion of connectedness: given integers \\(k\ge 2\\) and \\(1\le j \le k-1\\), two
\\(j\\)-sets (of vertices) lie in the same \\(j\\)-component if there is a sequence of
edges from one to the other such that consecutive edges intersect in at least
\\(j\\) vertices.
  We prove that certain collections of \\(j\\)-sets constructed during a
breadth-first search process on \\(j\\)-components in a random \\(k\\)-uniform
hypergraph are reasonably regularly distributed with high probability. We use
this property to provide a short proof of the asymptotic size of the giant
\\(j\\)-component shortly after it appears.
