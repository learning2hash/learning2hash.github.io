<p>We investigate the asymptotic rates of length-<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> binary codes with VC-dimension at most
<span class="math inline">\(dn\)</span> and minimum distance at least
<span class="math inline">\(\delta n\)</span>. Two upper bounds are
obtained, one as a simple corollary of a result by Haussler and the
other via a shortening approach combining Sauer-Shelah lemma and the
linear programming bound. Two lower bounds are given using
Gilbert-Varshamov type arguments over constant-weight and Markov-type
sets.</p>
