We investigate the asymptotic rates of length-\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} binary codes with VC-dimension at most \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(dn\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and minimum distance at least \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Two upper bounds are obtained, one as a simple corollary of a result by Haussler and the other via a shortening approach combining Sauer-Shelah lemma and the linear programming bound. Two lower bounds are given using Gilbert-Varshamov type arguments over constant-weight and Markov-type sets.
