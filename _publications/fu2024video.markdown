In the quest for artificial general intelligence Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored highlighting the absence of a comprehensive high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper we introduce Video-MME the first-ever full-spectrum Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features 1) Diversity in video types spanning 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2) Duration in temporal dimension encompassing both short- medium- and long-term videos ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour for robust contextual dynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames including subtitles and audios to unveil the all-round capabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations utilizing rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. 900 videos with a total of 254 hours are manually selected and annotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content resulting in 2700 question-answer pairs. With Video-MME we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro as well as open-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best-performing commercial model significantly outperforming the open-source models. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data. Project Page https://video-mme.github.io
