Online music services have tens of millions of tracks. The content itself is
broad and covers various musical genres as well as non-musical audio content
such as radio plays and podcasts. The sheer scale and diversity of content
makes it difficult for a user to find relevant tracks. Relevant recommendations
are therefore crucial for a good user experience. Here we present a method to
compute track-track similarities using collaborative filtering signals with
side information. On a data set from music streaming service SoundCloud, the
method here outperforms the widely adopted implicit matrix factorization
technique. The implementation of our method is open sourced and can be applied
to related item-item recommendation tasks with side information.
