We present InstantStyleGaussian, an innovative 3D style transfer method based
on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. By inputting a
target-style image, it quickly generates new 3D GS scenes. Our method operates
on pre-reconstructed GS scenes, combining diffusion models with an improved
iterative dataset update strategy. It utilizes diffusion models to generate
target style images, adds these new images to the training dataset, and uses
this dataset to iteratively update and optimize the GS scenes, significantly
accelerating the style editing process while ensuring the quality of the
generated scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
ensures high-quality stylized scenes while offering significant advantages in
style transfer speed and consistency.
