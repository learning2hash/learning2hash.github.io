Browsing and finding relevant information for Bangladeshi laws is a challenge
faced by all law students and researchers in Bangladesh, and by citizens who
want to learn about any legal procedure. Some law archives in Bangladesh are
digitized, but lack proper tools to organize the data meaningfully. We present
a text visualization tool that utilizes machine learning techniques to make the
searching of laws quicker and easier. Using Doc2Vec to layout law article
nodes, link mining techniques to visualize relevant citation networks, and
named entity recognition to quickly find relevant sections in long law
articles, our tool provides a faster and better search experience to the users.
Qualitative feedback from law researchers, students, and government officials
show promise for visually intuitive search tools in the context of
governmental, legal, and constitutional data in developing countries, where
digitized data does not necessarily pave the way towards an easy access to
information.
