The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is a permutation whose applications are
prevalent in data compression and text indexing. The bijective BWT (BBWT) is a
bijective variant of it. Although it is known that the BWT can be constructed
in linear time for integer alphabets by using a linear time suffix array
construction algorithm, it was up to now only conjectured that the BBWT can
also be constructed in linear time. We confirm this conjecture by proposing a
construction algorithm that is based on SAIS, improving the best known result
of \\(O(n \lg n /\lg \lg n)\\) time to linear.
