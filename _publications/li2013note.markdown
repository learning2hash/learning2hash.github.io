Let \\(E=\limsup\limits_\{n\to\infty\}(g_n+\xi_n)\\) be the random covering set on
the torus \\(\mathbb\{T\}^d\\), where \\(\\{g_n\\}\\) is a sequence of ball-like sets and
\\(\xi_n\\) is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly distributed on
\\(\T^d\\). We prove that \\(E\cap F\neq\emptyset\\) almost surely whenever
\\(F\subset\mathbb\{T\}^d\\) is an analytic set with Hausdorff dimension,
\\(\dim_H(F)>d-\alpha\\), where \\(\alpha\\) is the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of
\\(E\\). Moreover, examples are given to show that the condition on \\(\dim_H(F)\\)
cannot be replaced by the packing dimension of \\(F\\).
