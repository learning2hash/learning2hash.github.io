Given a Gromov-hyperbolic group \\(G\\) endowed with a finite symmetric
generating set, we study the statistics of counting measures on the spheres of
the associated Cayley graph under linear representations of \\(G\\). More
generally, we obtain a weak law of large numbers for subadditive functions,
echoing the classical Fekete lemma. For strongly irreducible and proximal
representations, we prove a counting central limit theorem with a Berry--Esseen
type error rate and exponential large deviation estimates. Moreover, in the
same setting, we show convergence of interpolated normalized matrix norms along
geodesic rays to Brownian motion and a functional law of iterated logarithm,
paralleling the analogous results in the theory of random matrix products. Our
counting large deviation estimates provide a positive answer to a question of
Kaimanovich--Kapovich--Schupp. In most cases, our counting limit theorems will
be obtained from stronger almost sure limit laws for Patterson--Sullivan
measures on the boundary of the group.
