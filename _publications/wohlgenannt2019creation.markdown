Word embeddings are already well studied in the general domain, usually
trained on large text corpora, and have been evaluated for example on word
similarity and analogy tasks, but also as an input to downstream NLP processes.
In contrast, in this work we explore the suitability of word embedding
technologies in the specialized digital humanities domain. After training
embedding models of various types on two popular fantasy novel book series, we
evaluate their performance on two task types: term analogies, and word
intrusion. To this end, we manually construct test datasets with domain
experts. Among the contributions are the evaluation of various word embedding
techniques on the different task types, with the findings that even embeddings
trained on small corpora perform well for example on the word intrusion task.
Furthermore, we provide extensive and high-quality datasets in digital
humanities for further investigation, as well as the implementation to easily
reproduce or extend the experiments.
