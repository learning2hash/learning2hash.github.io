In Linear Hashing (()) with (beta) bins on a size (u) universe (=01ldots u-1) items x_1x_2ldots x_nsubset mathcalU( are placed in bins by the hash function )x_imapsto (ax_i+b)mod p mod beta() for some prime (pin u2u) and randomly chosen integers ab in 1p(. The maxload of )mathsfLH is the number of items assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural measure of how well () distributes items amongst the bins. Fix (beta=n). Despite ()s simplicity bounding ()s worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs () achieves maxload Omegaleft(fraclog nloglog nright)(; this is currently the best lower bound for )mathsfLHs expected maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of widetildeO(n^1 / 3)(. The question Is the worst-case expected maxload of )mathsfLH (n^o(1)) is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math. In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on them.
