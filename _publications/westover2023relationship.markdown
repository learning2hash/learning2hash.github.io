<p>In Linear Hashing (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span>)
with <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> bins on a size <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> universe <span
class="math inline">\({\mathcal{U}=\{0,1,\ldots, u-1\}}\)</span>, items
<span class="math inline">\(\{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n\}\subset
\mathcal{U}\)</span> are placed in bins by the hash function <span
class="math display">\[x_i\mapsto (ax_i+b)\mod
p \mod \beta\]</span> for some prime <span class="math inline">\(p\in
[u,2u]\)</span> and randomly chosen integers <span
class="math inline">\(a,b
\in [1,p]\)</span>. The “maxload” of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span> is the number of items
assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of
items is a natural measure of how well <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span> distributes items amongst the
bins. Fix <span class="math inline">\(\beta=n\)</span>. Despite <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span>’s simplicity, bounding <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span>’s worst-case maxload is
extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span> achieves maxload <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log
n}\right)\)</span>; this is currently the best lower bound for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span>’s expected maxload. Recently
Knudsen established an upper bound of <span
class="math inline">\(\widetilde{O}(n^{1 /
3})\)</span>. The question “Is the worst-case expected maxload of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{LH}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(n^{o(1)}\)</span>?” is one of the most basic open
problems in discrete math. In this paper we propose a set of
intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this
problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open
questions and make some partial progress on them.</p>
