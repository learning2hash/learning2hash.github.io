In Linear Hashing (\\(\mathsf&#123;LH&#125;\\)) with \\(\beta\\) bins on a size \\(u\\) universe \\(&#123;\mathcal&#123;U&#125;=\&#123;0,1,\ldots, u-1\&#125;&#125;\\), items $\{x\_1,x\_2,\ldots, x\_n\}\subset \mathcal{U}\\( are placed in bins by the hash function \\)$x\_i\mapsto (ax\_i+b)\mod p \mod \beta\\(\\) for some prime \\(p\in [u,2u]\\) and randomly chosen integers $a,b \in [1,p]\\(. The maxload of \\)\mathsf{LH}$ is the number of items assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural measure of how well \\(\mathsf&#123;LH&#125;\\) distributes items amongst the bins. Fix \\(\beta=n\\). Despite \\(\mathsf&#123;LH&#125;\\)'s simplicity, bounding \\(\mathsf&#123;LH&#125;\\)'s worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs \\(\mathsf&#123;LH&#125;\\) achieves maxload $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)\\(; this is currently the best lower bound for \\)\mathsf{LH}$'s expected maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1 / 3})\\(. The question Is the worst-case expected maxload of \\)\mathsf{LH}$ \\(n^&#123;o(1)&#125;\\)? is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math. In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on them.
