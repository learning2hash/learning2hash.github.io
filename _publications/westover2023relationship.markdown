In Linear Hashing (\\{\mathsf\{LH\}\\}) with \\{\beta\\} bins on a size \\{u\\} universe
\\{\{\mathcal\{U\}=\\{0,1,\ldots, u-1\\}\}\\}, items \\{\\{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n\\}\subset
\mathcal\{U\}\\} are placed in bins by the hash function $\\{x_i\mapsto (ax_i+b)\mod
p \mod \beta\\}\\{ for some prime \\}p\in [u,2u]\\{ and randomly chosen integers \\}a,b
\in [1,p]\\{. The "maxload" of \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{ is the number of items assigned to
the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural
measure of how well \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{ distributes items amongst the bins.
  Fix \\}\beta=n\\{. Despite \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{'s simplicity, bounding \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{'s
worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random
inputs \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{ achieves maxload \\}Î©\left(\frac\{log n\}\{loglog
n\}\right)\\{; this is currently the best lower bound for \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{'s expected
maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of \\}\widetilde\{O\}(n^\{1 /
3\})\\{. The question "Is the worst-case expected maxload of \\}\mathsf\{LH\}\\{
\\}n^\{o(1)\}$?" is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math.
  In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help
researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship
between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on
them.
