In Linear Hashing (\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathsf\{LH\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}) with \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\beta\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} bins on a size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(u\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} universe \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\{\mathcal\{U\}=\\{0,1,\ldots, u-1\\}\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, items $\\{x\_1,x\_2,\ldots, x\_n\\}\subset \mathcal\{U\}\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( are placed in bins by the hash function \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}$x\_i\mapsto (ax\_i+b)\mod p \mod \beta\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for some prime \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(p\in [u,2u]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and randomly chosen integers $a,b \in [1,p]\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. The maxload of \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\mathsf\{LH\}$ is the number of items assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural measure of how well \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathsf\{LH\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} distributes items amongst the bins. Fix \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\beta=n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Despite \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathsf\{LH\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}'s simplicity, bounding \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathsf\{LH\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}'s worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathsf\{LH\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} achieves maxload $\Omega\left(\frac\{\log n\}\{\log\log n\}\right)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(; this is currently the best lower bound for \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\mathsf\{LH\}$'s expected maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of $\widetilde\{O\}(n^\{1 / 3\})\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. The question Is the worst-case expected maxload of \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\mathsf\{LH\}$ \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n^\{o(1)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}? is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math. In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on them.
