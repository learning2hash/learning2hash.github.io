Computing two45;way and multi45;way set similarities is a fundamental problem. This study focuses on estimating 345;way resemblance (Jaccard similarity) using b45;bit minwise hashing. While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits b45;bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest b bits (where b= 2 for 345;way). The extension to 345;way similarity from the prior work on 245;way similarity is technically non45;trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simplified estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that b45;bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 2545;fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 345;way resemblance.
