With the rapid advance of Internet technology and smart devices, users often
need to manage large amounts of multimedia information using smart devices,
such as personal image and video accessing and browsing. These requirements
heavily rely on the success of image (video) annotation, and thus large scale
image annotation through innovative machine learning methods has attracted
intensive attention in recent years. One representative work is support vector
machine (SVM). Although it works well in binary classification, SVM has a
non-smooth loss function and can not naturally cover multi-class case. In this
paper, we propose manifold regularized kernel logistic regression (KLR) for web
image annotation. Compared to SVM, KLR has the following advantages: (1) the
KLR has a smooth loss function; (2) the KLR produces an explicit estimate of
the probability instead of class label; and (3) the KLR can naturally be
generalized to the multi-class case. We carefully conduct experiments on MIR
FLICKR dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of manifold regularized kernel
logistic regression for image annotation.
