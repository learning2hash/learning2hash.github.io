*Sentiment Quantification* (i.e., the task of estimating the relative
frequency of sentiment-related classes -- such as \textsf\{Positive\} and
\textsf\{Negative\} -- in a set of unlabelled documents) is an important topic in
sentiment analysis, as the study of sentiment-related quantities and trends
across a population is often of higher interest than the analysis of individual
instances. In this work we propose a method for *Cross-Lingual Sentiment
Quantification*, the task of performing sentiment quantification when training
documents are available for a source language \\(\mathcal\{S\}\\) but not for the
target language \\(\mathcal\{T\}\\) for which sentiment quantification needs to be
performed. Cross-lingual sentiment quantification (and cross-lingual
*text* quantification in general) has never been discussed before in the
literature; we establish baseline results for the binary case by combining
state-of-the-art quantification methods with methods capable of generating
cross-lingual vectorial representations of the source and target documents
involved. We present experimental results obtained on publicly available
datasets for cross-lingual sentiment classification; the results show that the
presented methods can perform cross-lingual sentiment quantification with a
surprising level of accuracy.
