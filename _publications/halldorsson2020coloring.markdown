We give an improved randomized CONGEST algorithm for distance-\(2\) coloring
that uses \(\Delta^2+1\) colors and runs in \(O(log n)\) rounds, improving the
recent \(O(log \Delta \cdot log n)\)-round algorithm in [Halld\'orsson, Kuhn,
Maus; PODC '20]. We then improve the time complexity to \(O(log \Delta) +
2^\{O(\sqrt\{loglog n\})\}\).
