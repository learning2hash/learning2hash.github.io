We argue that Content-based filtering (CBF) and Graph-based methods (GB)
complement one another in Academic Search recommendations. The scientific
literature can be viewed as a conversation between authors and the audience.
CBF uses abstracts to infer authors' positions, and GB uses citations to infer
responses from the audience. In this paper, we describe nine differences
between CBF and GB, as well as synergistic opportunities for hybrid
combinations. Two embeddings will be used to illustrate these opportunities:
(1) Specter, a CBF method based on BERT-like deepnet encodings of abstracts,
and (2) ProNE, a GB method based on spectral clustering of more than 200M
papers and 2B citations from Semantic Scholar.
