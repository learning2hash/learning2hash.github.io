Annotating images with tags is useful for indexing and retrieving images.
However, many available annotation data include missing or inaccurate
annotations. In this paper, we propose an image annotation framework which
sequentially performs tag completion and refinement. We utilize the subspace
property of data via sparse subspace clustering for tag completion. Then we
propose a novel matrix completion model for tag refinement, integrating visual
correlation, semantic correlation and the novelly studied property of complex
errors. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple benchmark datasets even when they contain certain levels of annotation
noise.
