We combine multi-task learning and semi-supervised learning by inducing a
joint embedding space between disparate label spaces and learning transfer
functions between label embeddings, enabling us to jointly leverage unlabelled
data and auxiliary, annotated datasets. We evaluate our approach on a variety
of sequence classification tasks with disparate label spaces. We outperform
strong single and multi-task baselines and achieve a new state-of-the-art for
topic-based sentiment analysis.
