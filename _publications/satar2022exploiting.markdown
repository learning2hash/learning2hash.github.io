In this report, we present our approach for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance
Retrieval Challenge 2022. We first parse sentences into semantic roles
corresponding to verbs and nouns; then utilize self-attentions to exploit
semantic role contextualized video features along with textual features via
triplet losses in multiple embedding spaces. Our method overpasses the strong
baseline in normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), which is more
valuable for semantic similarity. Our submission is ranked 3rd for nDCG and
ranked 4th for mAP.
