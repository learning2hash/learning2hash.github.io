Let \(\mathcal\{M\}_\{g,n(g)\}\) be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus \(g\) with \(n(g)\) punctures endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the Cheeger constants and spectral gaps of random hyperbolic surfaces in \(\mathcal\{M\}_\{g,n(g)\}\), when \(n(g)\) grows slower than \(g\) as \(g\to \infty\).
