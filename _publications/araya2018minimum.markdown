Linear complementary dual codes (or codes with complementary duals) are codes
whose intersections with their dual codes are trivial. We study the largest
minimum weight \\(d(n,k)\\) among all binary linear complementary dual \\([n,k]\\)
codes. We determine \\(d(n,4)\\) for \\(n \equiv 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,13 \pmod\{15\}\\), and
\\(d(n,5)\\) for \\(n \equiv 3,4,5,7,11,19,20,22,26 \pmod\{31\}\\). Combined with known
results, the values \\(d(n,k)\\) are also determined for \\(n \le 24\\).
