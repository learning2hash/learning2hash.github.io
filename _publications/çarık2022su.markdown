This paper describes the system proposed by Sabanc\{\i\} University Natural
Language Processing Group in the SemEval-2022 MultiCoNER task. We developed an
unsupervised entity linking pipeline that detects potential entity mentions
with the help of Wikipedia and also uses the corresponding Wikipedia context to
help the classifier in finding the named entity type of that mention. Our
results showed that our pipeline improved performance significantly, especially
for complex entities in low-context settings.
