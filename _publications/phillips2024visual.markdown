In cinema, visual motifs are recurrent iconographic compositions that carry
artistic or aesthetic significance. Their use throughout the history of visual
arts and media is interesting to researchers and filmmakers alike. Our goal in
this work is to recognise and classify these motifs by proposing a new machine
learning model that uses a custom dataset to that end. We show how features
extracted from a CLIP model can be leveraged by using a shallow network and an
appropriate loss to classify images into 20 different motifs, with surprisingly
good results: an \\(F_1\\)-score of 0.91 on our test set. We also present several
ablation studies justifying the input features, architecture and
hyperparameters used.
