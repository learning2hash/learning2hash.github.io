The search for specific objects or motifs is essential to art history as both
assist in decoding the meaning of artworks. Digitization has produced large art
collections, but manual methods prove to be insufficient to analyze them. In the
following, we introduce an algorithm that allows users to search for image
regions containing specific motifs or objects and find similar regions in an
extensive dataset, helping art historians to analyze large digitized art
collections. Computer vision has presented efficient methods for visual instance
retrieval across photographs. However, applied to art collections, they reveal
severe deficiencies because of diverse motifs and massive domain shifts induced
by differences in techniques, materials, and styles. In this paper, we present a
multi-style feature fusion approach that successfully reduces the domain gap and
improves retrieval results without labelled data or curated image collections.
Our region-based voting with GPU-accelerated approximate nearest-neighbour
search allows us to find and localize even small motifs within an extensive
dataset in a few seconds. We obtain state-of-the-art results on the Brueghel
dataset and demonstrate its generalization to inhomogeneous collections with a
large number of distractors.
