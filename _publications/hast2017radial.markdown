Automatic recognition of historical handwritten manuscripts is a daunting
task due to paper degradation over time. Recognition-free retrieval or word
spotting is popularly used for information retrieval and digitization of the
historical handwritten documents. However, the performance of word spotting
algorithms depends heavily on feature detection and representation methods.
Although there exist popular feature descriptors such as Scale Invariant
Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), the invariant
properties of these descriptors amplify the noise in the degraded document
images, rendering them more sensitive to noise and complex characteristics of
historical manuscripts. Therefore, an efficient and relaxed feature descriptor
is required as handwritten words across different documents are indeed similar,
but not identical. This paper introduces a Radial Line Fourier (RLF) descriptor
for handwritten word representation, with a short feature vector of 32
dimensions. A segmentation-free and training-free handwritten word spotting
method is studied herein that relies on the proposed RLF descriptor, takes into
account different keypoint representations and uses a simple
preconditioner-based feature matching algorithm. The effectiveness of the RLF
descriptor for segmentation-free handwritten word spotting is empirically
evaluated on well-known historical handwritten datasets using standard
evaluation measures.
