Using publicly available traffic camera data in New York City, we quantify
time-dependent patterns in aggregate pedestrian foot traffic. These patterns
exhibit repeatable diurnal behaviors that differ for weekdays and weekends but
are broadly consistent across neighborhoods in the borough of Manhattan.
Weekday patterns contain a characteristic 3-peak structure with increased foot
traffic around 9:00am, 12:00-1:00pm, and 5:00pm aligned with the "9-to-5" work
day in which pedestrians are on the street during their morning commute, during
lunch hour, and then during their evening commute. Weekend days do not show a
peaked structure, but rather increase steadily until sunset. Our study period
of June 28, 2017 to September 11, 2017 contains two holidays, the 4th of July
and Labor Day, and their foot traffic patterns are quantitatively similar to
weekend days despite the fact that they fell on weekdays. Projecting all days
in our study period onto the weekday/weekend phase space (by regressing against
the average weekday and weekend day) we find that Friday foot traffic can be
represented as a mixture of both the 3-peak weekday structure and non-peaked
weekend structure. We also show that anomalies in the foot traffic patterns can
be used for detection of events and network-level disruptions. Finally, we show
that clustering of foot traffic time series generates associations between
cameras that are spatially aligned with Manhattan neighborhood boundaries
indicating that foot traffic dynamics encode information about neighborhood
character.
