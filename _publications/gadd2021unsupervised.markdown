We learn, in an unsupervised way, an embedding from sequences of radar images
that is suitable for solving place recognition problem using complex radar
data. We experiment on 280 km of data and show performance exceeding
state-of-the-art supervised approaches, localising correctly 98.38% of the time
when using just the nearest database candidate.
