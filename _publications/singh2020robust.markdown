The Internet has been weaponized to carry out cybercriminal activities at an
unprecedented pace. The rising concerns for preserving the privacy of personal
data while availing modern tools and technologies is alarming. End-to-end
encrypted solutions are in demand for almost all commercial platforms. On one
side, it seems imperative to provide such solutions and give people trust to
reliably use these platforms. On the other side, this creates a huge
opportunity to carry out unchecked cybercrimes. This paper proposes a robust
video hashing technique, scalable and efficient in chalking out matches from an
enormous bulk of videos floating on these commercial platforms. The video hash
is validated to be robust to common manipulations like scaling, corruptions by
noise, compression, and contrast changes that are most probable to happen
during transmission. It can also be transformed into the encrypted domain and
work on top of encrypted videos without deciphering. Thus, it can serve as a
potential forensic tool that can trace the illegal sharing of videos without
knowing the underlying content. Hence, it can help preserve privacy and combat
cybercrimes such as revenge porn, hateful content, child abuse, or illegal
material propagated in a video.
