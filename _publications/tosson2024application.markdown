We address the identification of grain-corresponding Laue reflections in
energy dispersive Laue diffraction (EDLD) experiments by formulating it as a
clustering problem solvable through unsupervised machine learning (ML). To
achieve reliable and efficient identification of grains in a Laue pattern, we
employ a combination of clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering
(HC) and K-means. These algorithms allow us to group together similar Laue
reflections, revealing the underlying grain structure in the diffraction
pattern. Additionally, we utilise the elbow method to determine the optimal
number of clusters, ensuring accurate results. To evaluate the performance of
our proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and
experimental datasets obtained from nickel wires. The simulated datasets were
generated to mimic the characteristics of real-world EDLD experiments, while
the experimental datasets were obtained from actual measurements.
