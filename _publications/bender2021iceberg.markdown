<p>Despite being one of the oldest data structures in computer science,
hash tables continue to be the focus of a great deal of both theoretical
and empirical research. A central reason for this is that many of the
fundamental properties that one desires from a hash table are difficult
to achieve simultaneously; thus many variants offering different
trade-offs have been proposed. This paper introduces Iceberg hashing, a
hash table that simultaneously offers the strongest known guarantees on
a large number of core properties. Iceberg hashing supports
constant-time operations while improving on the state of the art for
space efficiency, cache efficiency, and low failure probability. Iceberg
hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to
<span class="math inline">\(1 - o(1)\)</span> while being stable,
meaning that the position where an element is stored only ever changes
when resizes occur. In fact, in the setting where keys are <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span> bits, the space guarantees
that Iceberg hashing offers, namely that it uses at most <span
class="math inline">\(\log \binom{|U|}{n} + O(n \log \log n)\)</span>
bits to store <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items from a
universe <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, matches a lower bound
by Demaine et al. that applies to any stable hash table. Iceberg hashing
introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the most basic
aspects of hash-table design. Notably, our indirection-free technique
for dynamic resizing, which we call waterfall addressing, and our
techniques for achieving stability and very-high probability guarantees,
can be applied to any hash table that makes use of the
front-yard/backyard paradigm for hash table design.</p>
