The \(b\)-symbol metric is a generalization of the Hamming metric. Linear
codes, in the \(b\)-symbol metric, have been used in the read channel whose
outputs consist of \(b\) consecutive symbols. The Griesmer bound outperforms the
Singleton bound for \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\)-linear codes in the Hamming metric, when \(q\)
is fixed and the length is large enough. This scenario is also applicable in
the \(b\)-symbol metric. Shi, Zhu, and Helleseth recently made a conjecture on
cyclic codes in the \(b\)-symbol metric. In this paper, we present the \(b\)-symbol
Griesmer bound for linear codes by concatenating linear codes and simplex
codes. Based on cyclic codes and extended cyclic codes, we propose two families
of distance-optimal linear codes with respect to the \(b\)-symbol Griesmer bound.
