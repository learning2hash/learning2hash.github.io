Sentence embeddings have become an essential part of today's natural language
processing (NLP) systems, especially together advanced deep learning methods.
Although pre-trained sentence encoders are available in the general domain,
none exists for biomedical texts to date. In this work, we introduce
BioSentVec: the first open set of sentence embeddings trained with over 30
million documents from both scholarly articles in PubMed and clinical notes in
the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. We evaluate BioSentVec embeddings in two
sentence pair similarity tasks in different text genres. Our benchmarking
results demonstrate that the BioSentVec embeddings can better capture sentence
semantics compared to the other competitive alternatives and achieve
state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. We expect BioSentVec to facilitate
the research and development in biomedical text mining and to complement the
existing resources in biomedical word embeddings. BioSentVec is publicly
