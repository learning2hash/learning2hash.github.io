The limited availability of training data for low-resource languages makes
applying machine learning techniques challenging. Ancient Egyptian is one such
language with few resources. However, innovative applications of data
augmentation methods, such as Neural Style Transfer, could overcome these
barriers. This paper presents a novel method for generating datasets of ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs by applying NST to a digital typeface. Experimental
results found that image classification models trained on NST-generated
examples and photographs demonstrate equal performance and transferability to
real unseen images of hieroglyphs.
