We propose a simple and straightforward way of creating powerful image
representations via cross-dimensional weighting and aggregation of deep
convolutional neural network layer outputs. We first present a generalized
framework that encompasses a broad family of approaches and includes
cross-dimensional pooling and weighting steps. We then propose specific
non-parametric schemes for both spatial- and channel-wise weighting that boost
the effect of highly active spatial responses and at the same time regulate
burstiness effects. We experiment on different public datasets for image search
and show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for
approaches based on pre-trained networks. We also provide an easy-to-use, open
source implementation that reproduces our results.
