For convolutional neural network models that optimize an image embedding, we
propose a method to highlight the regions of images that contribute most to
pairwise similarity. This work is a corollary to the visualization tools
developed for classification networks, but applicable to the problem domains
better suited to similarity learning. The visualization shows how similarity
networks that are fine-tuned learn to focus on different features. We also
generalize our approach to embedding networks that use different pooling
strategies and provide a simple mechanism to support image similarity searches
on objects or sub-regions in the query image.
