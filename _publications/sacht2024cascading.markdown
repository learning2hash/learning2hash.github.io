We propose a new method to accurately approximate the Pompeiu-Hausdorff
distance from a triangle soup A to another triangle soup B up to a given
tolerance. Based on lower and upper bound computations, we discard triangles
from A that do not contain the maximizer of the distance to B and subdivide the
others for further processing. In contrast to previous methods, we use four
upper bounds instead of only one, three of which newly proposed by us. Many
triangles are discarded using the simpler bounds, while the most difficult
cases are dealt with by the other bounds. Exhaustive testing determines the
best ordering of the four upper bounds. A collection of experiments shows that
our method is faster than all previous accurate methods in the literature.
