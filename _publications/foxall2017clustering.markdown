We study the \\(\kappa\\)-color cyclic particle system on the one-dimensional
integer lattice \\(\mathbb\{Z\}\\), first introduced by Bramson and Griffeath in
\cite\{bramson1989flux\}. In that paper they show that almost surely, every site
changes its color infinitely often if \\(\kappa\in \\{3,4\\}\\) and only finitely
many times if \\(\kappa\ge 5\\). In addition, they conjecture that for \\(\kappa\in
\\{3,4\\}\\) the system clusters, that is, for any pair of sites \\(x,y\\), with
probability tending to 1 as \\(t\to\infty\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same color at
time \\(t\\). Here we prove that conjecture.
