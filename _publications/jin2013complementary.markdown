Recently, hashing techniques have been widely applied
to solve the approximate nearest neighbors search problem
in many vision applications. Generally, these hashing
approaches generate 2^c buckets, where c is the length
of the hash code. A good hashing method should satisfy
the following two requirements: 1) mapping the nearby
data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by
the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are
evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper,
we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection
Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions
which explicitly considers the above two requirements.
Specifically, CPH aims at sequentially finding a series of hyperplanes
(hashing functions) which cross the sparse region
of the data. At the same time, the data points are evenly distributed
in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes.
The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing
methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.
