The detection of offensive, hateful content on social media is a challenging
problem that affects many online users on a daily basis. Hateful content is
often used to target a group of people based on ethnicity, gender, religion and
other factors. The hate or contempt toward women has been increasing on social
platforms. Misogynous content detection is especially challenging when textual
and visual modalities are combined to form a single context, e.g., an overlay
text embedded on top of an image, also known as meme. In this paper, we present
a multimodal architecture that combines textual and visual features in order to
detect misogynous meme content. The proposed architecture is evaluated in the
SemEval-2022 Task 5: MAMI - Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification
challenge under the team name TIB-VA. Our solution obtained the best result in
the Task-B where the challenge is to classify whether a given document is
misogynous and further identify the main sub-classes of shaming, stereotype,
objectification, and violence.
