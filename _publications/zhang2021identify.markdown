Agriculture is an essential industry in the both society and economy of a
country. However, the pests and diseases cause a great amount of reduction in
agricultural production while there is not sufficient guidance for farmers to
avoid this disaster. To address this problem, we apply CNNs to plant disease
recognition by building a classification model. Within the dataset of 3,642
images of apple leaves, We use a pre-trained image classification model
Restnet34 based on a Convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Fastai
framework in order to save the training time. Overall, the accuracy of
classification is 93.765%.
