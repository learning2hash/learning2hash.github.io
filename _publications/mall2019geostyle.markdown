Understanding fashion styles and trends is of great potential interest to
retailers and consumers alike. The photos people upload to social media are a
historical and public data source of how people dress across the world and at
different times. While we now have tools to automatically recognize the
clothing and style attributes of what people are wearing in these photographs,
we lack the ability to analyze spatial and temporal trends in these attributes
or make predictions about the future. In this paper, we address this need by
providing an automatic framework that analyzes large corpora of street imagery
to (a) discover and forecast long-term trends of various fashion attributes as
well as automatically discovered styles, and (b) identify spatio-temporally
localized events that affect what people wear. We show that our framework makes
long term trend forecasts that are >20% more accurate than the prior art, and
identifies hundreds of socially meaningful events that impact fashion across
the globe.
