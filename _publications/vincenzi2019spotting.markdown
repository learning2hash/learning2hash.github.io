Nowadays, Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs) raise a severe threat for public
health, accounting for a considerable amount of human illnesses. Recently,
several surveillance plans have been put in place for limiting the spread of
such diseases, typically involving on-field measurements. Such a systematic and
effective plan still misses, due to the high costs and efforts required for
implementing it. Ideally, any attempt in this field should consider the
triangle vectors-host-pathogen, which is strictly linked to the environmental
and climatic conditions. In this paper, we exploit satellite imagery from
Sentinel-2 mission, as we believe they encode the environmental factors
responsible for the vector's spread. Our analysis - conducted in a data-driver
fashion - couples spectral images with ground-truth information on the
abundance of Culicoides imicola. In this respect, we frame our task as a binary
classification problem, underpinning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as
being able to learn useful representation from multi-band images. Additionally,
we provide a multi-instance variant, aimed at extracting temporal patterns from
a short sequence of spectral images. Experiments show promising results,
providing the foundations for novel supportive tools, which could depict where
surveillance and prevention measures could be prioritized.
