<p>We study distributed protocols for finding all pairs of similar
vectors in a large dataset. Our results pertain to a variety of discrete
metrics, and we give concrete instantiations for Hamming distance. In
particular, we give improved upper bounds on the overhead required for
similarity defined by Hamming distance <span
class="math inline">\(r&gt;1\)</span> and prove a lower bound showing
qualitative optimality of the overhead required for similarity over any
Hamming distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Our main
conceptual contribution is a connection between similarity search
algorithms and certain graph-theoretic quantities. For our upper bounds,
we exhibit a general method for designing one-round protocols using
edge-isoperimetric shapes in similarity graphs. For our lower bounds, we
define a new combinatorial optimization problem, which can be stated in
purely graph-theoretic terms yet also captures the core of the analysis
in previous theoretical work on distributed similarity joins. As one of
our main technical results, we prove new bounds on distance correlations
in subsets of the Hamming cube.</p>
