We demonstrate that a graph45;based search algorithm45;relying on the construction of an approximate neighborhood graph45;can directly work with challenging non45;metric and/or non45;symmetric distances without resorting to metric45;space mapping and/or distance symmetrization which in turn lead to substantial performance degradation. Although the straightforward metrization and symmetrization is usually ineffective we find that constructing an index using a modified e.g. symmetrized distance can improve performance. This observation paves a way to a new line of research of designing index45;specific graph45;construction distance functions.
