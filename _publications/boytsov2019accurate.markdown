We demonstrate that a graph-based search algorithm-relying on the
construction of an approximate neighborhood graph-can directly work with
challenging non-metric and/or non-symmetric distances without resorting to
metric-space mapping and/or distance symmetrization, which, in turn, lead to
substantial performance degradation. Although the straightforward metrization
and symmetrization is usually ineffective, we find that constructing an index
using a modified, e.g., symmetrized, distance can improve performance. This
observation paves a way to a new line of research of designing index-specific
graph-construction distance functions.
