    We demonstrate that a graph-based search algorithm-relying on the construction of an approximate neighborhood graph-can directly work with challenging non-metric and/or non-symmetric distances without resorting to metric-space mapping and/or distance symmetrization, which, in turn, lead to substantial performance degradation. Although the straightforward metrization and symmetrization is usually ineffective, we find that constructing an index using a modified, e.g., symmetrized, distance can improve performance. This observation paves a way to a new line of research of designing index-specific graph-construction distance functions.
