Wasserstein distances provide a metric on a space of probability measures. We
consider the space \\(Ω\\) of all probability measures on the finite set \\(\chi
= \\{1, \dots ,n\\}\\) where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. 1-Wasserstein distance,
\\(W_1(\mu,\nu)\\) is a function from \\(Ω \times Ω\\) to \\([0,\infty)\\). This
paper derives closed form expressions for the First and Second moment of \\(W_1\\)
on \\(Ω \times Ω\\) assuming a uniform distribution on \\(Ω \times
Ω\\).
