We present an algorithm computing the longest periodic subsequence of a
string of length \(n\) in \(O(n^7)\) time with \(O(n^4)\) words of space. We obtain
improvements when restricting the exponents or extending the search allowing
the reported subsequence to be subperiodic down to \(O(n^3)\) time and \(O(n^2)\)
words of space.
