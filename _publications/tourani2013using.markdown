Crawler-based search engines are the mostly used search engines among web and
Internet users, involve web crawling, storing in database, ranking, indexing
and displaying to the user. But it is noteworthy that because of increasing
changes in web sites search engines suffer high time and transfers costs which
are consumed to investigate the existence of each page in database while
crawling, updating database and even investigating its existence in any
crawling operations. "Exclusive Web Crawler" proposes guidelines for crawling
features, links, media and other elements and to store crawling results in a
certain table in its database on the web. With doing this, search engines store
each site's tables in their databases and implement their ranking results on
them. Thus, accuracy of data in every table (and its being up-to-date) is
ensured and no 404 result is shown in search results since, in fact, this data
crawler crawls data entered by webmaster and the database stores whatever he
wants to display.
