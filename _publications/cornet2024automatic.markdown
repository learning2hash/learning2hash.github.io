Die studies are fundamental to quantifying ancient monetary production,
providing insights into the relationship between coinage, politics, and
history. The process requires tedious manual work, which limits the size of the
corpora that can be studied. Few works have attempted to automate this task,
and none have been properly released and evaluated from a computer vision
perspective. We propose a fully automatic approach that introduces several
innovations compared to previous methods. We rely on fast and robust local
descriptors matching that is set automatically. Second, the core of our
proposal is a clustering-based approach that uses an intrinsic metric (that
does not need the ground truth labels) to determine its critical
hyper-parameters. We validate the approach on two corpora of Greek coins,
propose an automatic implementation and evaluation of previous baselines, and
show that our approach significantly outperforms them.
