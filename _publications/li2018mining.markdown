Emojis have been widely used in textual communications as a new way to convey
nonverbal cues. An interesting observation is the various emoji usage patterns
among different users. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between
user personality traits and their emoji usage patterns, particularly on overall
amounts and specific preferences. To achieve this goal, we build a large
Twitter dataset which includes 352,245 users and over 1.13 billion tweets
associated with calculated personality traits and emoji usage patterns. Our
correlation and emoji prediction results provide insights into the power of
diverse personalities that lead to varies emoji usage patterns as well as its
potential in emoji recommendation tasks.
