Question semantic similarity (Q2Q) is a challenging task that is very useful
in many NLP applications, such as detecting duplicate questions and question
answering systems. In this paper, we present the results and findings of the
shared task (Semantic Question Similarity in Arabic). The task was organized as
part of the first workshop on NLP Solutions for Under Resourced Languages
(NSURL 2019) The goal of the task is to predict whether two questions are
semantically similar or not, even if they are phrased differently. A total of 9
teams participated in the task. The datasets created for this task are made
publicly available to support further research on Arabic Q2Q.
