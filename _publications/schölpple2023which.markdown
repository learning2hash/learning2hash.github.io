Given a Banach space \\(E\\) consisting of functions, we ask whether there exists
a reproducing kernel Hilbert space \\(H\\) with bounded kernel such that \\(E\subset
H\\). More generally, we consider the question, whether for a given Banach space
consisting of functions \\(F\\) with \\(E\subset F\\), there exists an intermediate
reproducing kernel Hilbert space \\(E\subset H\subset F\\). We provide both
sufficient and necessary conditions for this to hold. Moreover, we show that
for typical classes of function spaces described by smoothness there is a
strong dependence on the underlying dimension: the smoothness \\(s\\) required for
the space \\(E\\) needs to grow *proportional* to the dimension \\(d\\) in order
to allow for an intermediate reproducing kernel Hilbert space \\(H\\).
