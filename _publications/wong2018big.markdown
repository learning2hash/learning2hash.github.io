In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic data explosion in genomics,
thanks to the improvement in sequencing technologies and the drastically
decreasing costs. We are entering the era of millions of available genomes.
Notably, each genome can be composed of billions of nucleotides stored as plain
text files in GigaBytes (GBs). It is undeniable that those genome data impose
unprecedented data challenges for us. In this article, we briefly discuss the
big data challenges associated with genomics in recent years.
