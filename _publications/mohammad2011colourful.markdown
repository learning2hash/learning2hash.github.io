Since many real-world concepts are associated with colour, for example danger
with red, linguistic information is often complimented with the use of
appropriate colours in information visualization and product marketing. Yet,
there is no comprehensive resource that captures concept-colour associations.
We present a method to create a large word-colour association lexicon by
crowdsourcing. We focus especially on abstract concepts and emotions to show
that even though they cannot be physically visualized, they too tend to have
strong colour associations. Finally, we show how word-colour associations
manifest themselves in language, and quantify usefulness of co-occurrence and
polarity cues in automatically detecting colour associations.
