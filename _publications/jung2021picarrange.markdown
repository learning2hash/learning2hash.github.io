The native macOS application PicArrange integrates state-of-the-art image sorting and similarity search to enable users to get a better overview of their images. Many file and image management features have been added to make it a tool that addresses a full image management workflow. A modification of the Self Sorting Map algorithm enables a list-like image arrangement without loosing the visual sorting. Efficient calculation and storage of visual features as well as the use of many macOS APIs result in an application that is fluid to use.
