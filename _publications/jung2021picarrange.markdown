The native macOS application PicArrange integrates state-of-the-art image
sorting and similarity search to enable users to get a better overview of their
images. Many file and image management features have been added to make it a
tool that addresses a full image management workflow. A modification of the
Self Sorting Map algorithm enables a list-like image arrangement without
loosing the visual sorting. Efficient calculation and storage of visual
features as well as the use of many macOS APIs result in an application that is
fluid to use.
