In this paper we prove new lower bounds for the maximal size of permutation
codes by connecting the theory of permutation codes with the theory of linear
block codes. More specifically, using the columns of a parity check matrix of
an \([n,k,d]_q\) linear block code, we are able to prove the existence of a
permutation code in the symmetric group of degree \(n\), having minimum distance
at least \(d\) and large cardinality. With our technique, we obtain new lower
bounds for permutation codes that enhance the ones in the literature and
provide asymptotic improvements in certain regimes of length and distance of
the permutation code.
