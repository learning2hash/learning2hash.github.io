In [10], the existence of \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\)-linear MRD-codes of
\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^\{6\times 6\}\), with dimension \(12\), minimum distance \(5\) and left
idealiser isomorphic to \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^6\}\), defined by a trinomial of
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^6\}[x]\), when \(q\) is odd and \(q\equiv 0,\pm 1\pmod 5\), has been
proved. In this paper we show that this family produces \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\)-linear
MRD-codes of \(\mathbb\{F\}_q^\{6\times 6\}\), with the same properties, also in the
remaining \(q\) odd cases, but not in the \(q\) even case. These MRD-codes are not
equivalent to the previously known MRD-codes. We also prove that the
corresponding maximum scattered \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\)-linear sets of
\(\mathrm\{PG\}(1,q^6)\) are not \(\mathrm\{P\}\Gamma\mathrm\{L\}(2,q^6)\)-equivalent to
any previously known scattered linear set.
