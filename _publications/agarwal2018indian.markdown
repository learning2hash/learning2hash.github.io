Indian regional movie dataset is the first database of regional Indian
movies, users and their ratings. It consists of movies belonging to 18
different Indian regional languages and metadata of users with varying
demographics. Through this dataset, the diversity of Indian regional cinema and
its huge viewership is captured. We analyze the dataset that contains roughly
10K ratings of 919 users and 2,851 movies using some supervised and
unsupervised collaborative filtering techniques like Probabilistic Matrix
Factorization, Matrix Completion, Blind Compressed Sensing etc. The dataset
consists of metadata information of users like age, occupation, home state and
known languages. It also consists of metadata of movies like genre, language,
release year and cast. India has a wide base of viewers which is evident by the
large number of movies released every year and the huge box-office revenue.
This dataset can be used for designing recommendation systems for Indian users
and regional movies, which do not, yet, exist. The dataset can be downloaded
