We investigate coding schemes that map source symbols into multisets of an
alphabet set. Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to
the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over
proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit\{multiset combinatorial Gray
code\} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses
combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as
a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing
a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the
images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the
mapping as a \textit\{color mapping\} and the code as a \textit\{color multiset
code\}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to
construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids.
We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on
codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application
of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and
show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism. Some
numerical results are presented to conclude the paper.
