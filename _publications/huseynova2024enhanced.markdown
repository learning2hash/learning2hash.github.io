Document retrieval systems have experienced a revitalized interest with the
advent of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG architecture offers a lower
hallucination rate than LLM-only applications. However, the accuracy of the
retrieval mechanism is known to be a bottleneck in the efficiency of these
applications. A particular case of subpar retrieval performance is observed in
situations where multiple documents from several different but related topics
are in the corpus. We have devised a new vectorization method that takes into
account the topic information of the document. The paper introduces this new
method for text vectorization and evaluates it in the context of RAG.
Furthermore, we discuss the challenge of evaluating RAG systems, which pertains
to the case at hand.
