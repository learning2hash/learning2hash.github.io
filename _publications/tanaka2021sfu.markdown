We present a dataset that contains object annotations with unique object
identities (IDs) for the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) v1 Common Test
Conditions (CTC) sequences. Ground-truth annotations for 13 sequences were
prepared and released as the dataset called SFU-HW-Tracks-v1. For each video
frame, ground truth annotations include object class ID, object ID, and
bounding box location and its dimensions. The dataset can be used to evaluate
object tracking performance on uncompressed video sequences and study the
relationship between video compression and object tracking.
