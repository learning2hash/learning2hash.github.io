Despite the recent developments in spatiotemporal local features for action
recognition in video sequences, local color information has so far been
ignored. However, color has been proved an important element to the success of
automated recognition of objects and scenes. In this paper we extend the
space-time interest point descriptor STIP to take into account the color
information on the features' neighborhood. We compare the performance of our
color-aware version of STIP (which we have called HueSTIP) with the original
one.
