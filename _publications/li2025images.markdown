Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) helps us understand how bloodstains form,
with a focus on their size, shape, and distribution. This aids in crime scene
reconstruction and provides insight into victim positions and crime
investigation. One challenge in BPA is distinguishing between different types
of bloodstains, such as those from firearms, impacts, or other mechanisms. Our
study focuses on differentiating impact spatter bloodstain patterns from
gunshot bloodstain patterns. We distinguish patterns by extracting
well-designed individual stain features, applying effective data consolidation
methods, and selecting boosting classifiers. As a result, we have developed a
model that excels in both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we use outside
data sources from previous studies to discuss the challenges and future
directions for BPA.
