Creative works, whether paintings or memes, follow unique journeys that
result in their final form. Understanding these journeys, a process known as
"provenance analysis", provides rich insights into the use, motivation, and
authenticity underlying any given work. The application of this type of study
to the expanse of unregulated content on the Internet is what we consider in
this paper. Provenance analysis provides a snapshot of the chronology and
validity of content as it is uploaded, re-uploaded, and modified over time.
Although still in its infancy, automated provenance analysis for online
multimedia is already being applied to different types of content. Most current
works seek to build provenance graphs based on the shared content between
images or videos. This can be a computationally expensive task, especially when
considering the vast influx of content that the Internet sees every day.
Utilizing non-content-based information, such as timestamps, geotags, and
camera IDs can help provide important insights into the path a particular image
or video has traveled during its time on the Internet without large
computational overhead. This paper tests the scope and applicability of
metadata-based inferences for provenance graph construction in two different
scenarios: digital image forensics and cultural analytics.
