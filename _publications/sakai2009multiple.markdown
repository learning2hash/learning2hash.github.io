A robust classification method is developed on the basis of sparse subspace
decomposition. This method tries to decompose a mixture of subspaces of
unlabeled data (queries) into class subspaces as few as possible. Each query is
classified into the class whose subspace significantly contributes to the
decomposed subspace. Multiple queries from different classes can be
simultaneously classified into their respective classes. A practical greedy
algorithm of the sparse subspace decomposition is designed for the
classification. The present method achieves high recognition rate and robust
performance exploiting joint sparsity.
