With the rising numbers for IoT objects, it is becoming easier to penetrate
counterfeit objects into the mainstream market by adversaries. Such
infiltration of bogus products can be addressed with third-party-verifiable
identification. Generally, state-of-the-art identification schemes do not
guarantee that an identifier e.g. barcodes or RFID itself cannot be forged.
This paper introduces identification patterns representing the objects
intrinsic identity by robust hashes and not only by generated identification
patterns. Inspired by these two notions, a collection of uniquely identifiable
attributes called quasi-identifiers (QI) can be used to identify an object.
Since all attributes do not contribute equally towards an object's identity,
each QI has a different contribution towards the identifier. A robust hash
developed utilising the QI has been named fuzzified robust hashes (FaR hashes),
which can be used as an object identifier. Although the FaR hash is a single
hash string, selected bits change in response to the modification of QI. On the
other hand, other QIs in the object are more important for the object's
identity. If these QIs change, the complete FaR hash is going to change. The
calculation of FaR hash using attributes should allow third parties to generate
the identifier and compare it with the current one to verify the genuineness of
the object.
