Using crowdsourcing, we collected more than 10,000 URL pairs (parallel top
page pairs) of bilingual websites that contain parallel documents and created a
Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus of 4.6M sentence pairs from these websites. We
used a Japanese-Chinese bilingual dictionary of 160K word pairs for document
and sentence alignment. We then used high-quality 1.2M Japanese-Chinese
sentence pairs to train a parallel corpus filter based on statistical language
models and word translation probabilities. We compared the translation accuracy
of the model trained on these 4.6M sentence pairs with that of the model
trained on Japanese-Chinese sentence pairs from CCMatrix (12.4M), a parallel
corpus from global web mining. Although our corpus is only one-third the size
of CCMatrix, we found that the accuracy of the two models was comparable and
confirmed that it is feasible to use crowdsourcing for web mining of parallel
data.
