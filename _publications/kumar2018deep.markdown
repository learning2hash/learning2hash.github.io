We investigate the concept of deep barcodes and propose two methods to
generate them in order to expedite the process of classification and retrieval
of histopathology images. Since binary search is computationally less
expensive, in terms of both speed and storage, deep barcodes could be useful
when dealing with big data retrieval. Our experiments use the dataset Kimia
Path24 to test three pre-trained networks for image retrieval. The dataset
consists of 27,055 training images in 24 different classes with large
variability, and 1,325 test images for testing. Apart from the high-speed and
efficiency, results show a surprising retrieval accuracy of 71.62% for deep
barcodes, as compared to 68.91% for deep features and 68.53% for compressed
deep features.
