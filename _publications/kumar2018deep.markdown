We investigate the concept of deep barcodes and propose two methods to generate
them in order to expedite the process of classification and retrieval of
histopathology images. Since binary search is computationally less expensive, in
terms of both speed and storage, deep barcodes could be useful when dealing with
big data retrieval. Our experiments use the dataset Kimia Path24 to test three
pre-trained networks for image retrieval. The dataset consists of 27,055
training images in 24 different classes with large variability, and 1,325 test
images for testing. Apart from the high-speed and efficiency, results show a
surprising retrieval accuracy of 71.62% for deep barcodes, as compared to 68.91%
for deep features and 68.53% for compressed deep features.
