Vehicle information recognition is crucial in various practical domains,
particularly in criminal investigations. Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has
garnered significant research interest because color is a visually
distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion
and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this
task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has
been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new
dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from
six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors,
and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration
information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a
widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The
results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested
models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR.
Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors
made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for
future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of
fine-grained vehicle classification.
