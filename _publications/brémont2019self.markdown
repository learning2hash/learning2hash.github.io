For classical Bernoulli convolutions, the Rajchman property, i.e. the
convergence to zero at infinity of the Fourier transform, was characterized by
successive works of Erd\{\"o\}s [2] and Salem [12]. We prove weak forms of their
results for general self-similar measures associated to affine contractions of
the real line.
