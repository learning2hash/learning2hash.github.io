Image or video appearance features (e.g., color, texture, tone, illumination,
and so on) reflect one's visual perception and direct impression of an image or
video. Given a source image (video) and a target image (video), the image
(video) color transfer technique aims to process the color of the source image
or video (note that the source image or video is also referred to the reference
image or video in some literature) to make it look like that of the target
image or video, i.e., transferring the appearance of the target image or video
to that of the source image or video, which can thereby change one's perception
of the source image or video. As an extension of color transfer, style transfer
refers to rendering the content of a target image or video in the style of an
artist with either a style sample or a set of images through a style transfer
model. As an emerging field, the study of style transfer has attracted the
attention of a large number of researchers. After decades of development, it
has become a highly interdisciplinary research with a variety of artistic
expression styles can be achieved. This paper provides an overview of color
transfer and style transfer methods over the past years.
