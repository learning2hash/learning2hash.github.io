Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in
information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the
joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining
inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to
its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In
this work we propose a number of incremental improvements to the ColBERT model
architecture and training pipeline, using methods shown to work in the more
mature single-vector embedding model training paradigm, particularly those that
apply to heterogeneous multilingual data or boost efficiency with little
tradeoff. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance
across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks.
