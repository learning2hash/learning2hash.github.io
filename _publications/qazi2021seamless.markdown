The importance and relevance of digital image forensics has attracted
researchers to establish different techniques for creating as well as detecting
forgeries. The core category in passive image forgery is copy-move image
forgery that affects the originality of image by applying a different
transformation. In this paper frequency domain image manipulation method is
being presented.The method exploits the localized nature of discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to get hold of the region of the host image to be manipulated.
Both the patch and host image are subjected to DWT at the same level \(l\) to get
\(3l + 1\) sub-bands and each sub-band of the patch is pasted to the identified
region in the corresponding sub-band of the host image. The resultant
manipulated host sub-bands are then subjected to inverse DWT to get the final
manipulated host image. The proposed method shows good resistance against
detection by two frequency domain forgery detection methods from the
literature. The purpose of this research work is to create the forgery and
highlight the need to produce forgery detection methods that are robust against
the malicious copy-move forgery.
