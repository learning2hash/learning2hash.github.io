This paper presents a novel design of the system aimed at supporting the
Wikipedia community in addressing vandalism on the platform. To achieve this,
we collected a massive dataset of 47 languages, and applied advanced filtering
and feature engineering techniques, including multilingual masked language
modeling to build the training dataset from human-generated data. The
performance of the system was evaluated through comparison with the one used in
production in Wikipedia, known as ORES. Our research results in a significant
increase in the number of languages covered, making Wikipedia patrolling more
efficient to a wider range of communities. Furthermore, our model outperforms
ORES, ensuring that the results provided are not only more accurate but also
less biased against certain groups of contributors.
