Entity Linking is one of the most common Natural Language Processing tasks in
practical applications, but so far efficient end-to-end solutions with
multilingual coverage have been lacking, leading to complex model stacks. To
fill this gap, we release and open source BELA, the first fully end-to-end
multilingual entity linking model that efficiently detects and links entities
in texts in any of 97 languages. We provide here a detailed description of the
model and report BELA's performance on four entity linking datasets covering
high- and low-resource languages.
