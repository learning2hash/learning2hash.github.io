This work proposes to obtain novel fractal descriptors from gray-level
texture images by combining information from interior and boundary measures of
the Minkowski dilation applied to the texture surface. At first, the image is
converted into a surface where the height of each point is the gray intensity
of the respective pixel in that position in the image. Thus, this surface is
morphologically dilated by spheres. The radius of such spheres is ranged within
an interval and the volume and the external area of the dilated structure are
computed for each radius. The final descriptors are given by such measures
concatenated and subject to a canonical transform to reduce the dimensionality.
The proposal is an enhancement to the classical Bouligand-Minkowski fractal
descriptors, where only the volume (interior) information is considered. As
different structures may have the same volume, but not the same area, the
proposal yields to more rich descriptors as confirmed by results on the
classification of benchmark databases.
