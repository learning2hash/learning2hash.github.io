A large number of embeddings trained on medical data have emerged, but it
remains unclear how well they represent medical terminology, in particular
whether the close relationship of semantically similar medical terms is encoded
in these embeddings. To date, only small datasets for testing medical term
similarity are available, not allowing to draw conclusions about the
generalisability of embeddings to the enormous amount of medical terms used by
doctors. We present multiple automatically created large-scale medical term
similarity datasets and confirm their high quality in an annotation study with
doctors. We evaluate state-of-the-art word and contextual embeddings on our new
datasets, comparing multiple vector similarity metrics and word vector
aggregation techniques. Our results show that current embeddings are limited in
their ability to adequately encode medical terms. The novel datasets thus form
a challenging new benchmark for the development of medical embeddings able to
accurately represent the whole medical terminology.
