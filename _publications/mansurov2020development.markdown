In this paper, we share the process of developing word embeddings for the
Cyrillic variant of the Uzbek language. The result of our work is the first
publicly available set of word vectors trained on the word2vec, GloVe, and
fastText algorithms using a high-quality web crawl corpus developed in-house.
The developed word embeddings can be used in many natural language processing
downstream tasks.
