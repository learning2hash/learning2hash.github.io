Learning an event classifier is challenging when the scenes are semantically
different but visually similar. However, as humans, we typically handle such
tasks painlessly by adding our background semantic knowledge. Motivated by this
observation, we aim to provide an empirical study about how additional
information such as semantic keywords can boost up the discrimination of such
events. To demonstrate the validity of this study, we first construct a novel
Malicious Crowd Dataset containing crowd images with two events, benign and
malicious, which look visually similar. Note that the primary focus of this
paper is not to provide the state-of-the-art performance on this dataset but to
show the beneficial aspects of using semantically-driven keyword information.
By leveraging crowd-sourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, we
collect semantic keywords associated with images and then subsequently identify
a subset of keywords (e.g. police, fire, etc.) unique to specific events. We
first show that by using recently introduced attention models, a naive
CNN-based event classifier actually learns to primarily focus on local
attributes associated with the discriminant semantic keywords identified by the
Turks. We further show that incorporating the keyword-driven information into
early- and late-fusion approaches can significantly enhance malicious event
classification.
