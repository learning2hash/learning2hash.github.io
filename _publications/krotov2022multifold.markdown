A multifold \\(1\\)-perfect code (\\(1\\)-perfect code for list decoding) in any
graph is a set \\(C\\) of vertices such that every vertex of the graph is at
distance not more than \\(1\\) from exactly \\(\mu\\) elements of \\(C\\). In \\(q\\)-ary
Hamming graphs, where \\(q\\) is a prime power, we characterize all parameters of
multifold \\(1\\)-perfect codes and all parameters of additive multifold
\\(1\\)-perfect codes. In particular, we show that additive multifold \\(1\\)-perfect
codes are related to special multiset generalizations of spreads, multispreads,
and that multispreads of parameters corresponding to multifold \\(1\\)-perfect
codes always exist.
  Keywords: perfect codes, multifold packing, multiple covering, list-decoding
codes, additive codes, spreads, multispreads, completely regular codes,
intriguing sets.
