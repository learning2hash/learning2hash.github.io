This paper presents the 1st place solution to the Google Landmark Retrieval
2020 Competition on Kaggle. The solution is based on metric learning to
classify numerous landmark classes, and uses transfer learning with two train
datasets, fine-tuning on bigger images, adjusting loss weight for cleaner
samples, and esemble to enhance the model's performance further. Finally, it
scored 0.38677 mAP@100 on the private leaderboard.
