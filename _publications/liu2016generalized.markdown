Vector quantization is an essential tool for tasks involving large scale
data, for example, large scale similarity search, which is crucial for
content-based information retrieval and analysis. In this paper, we propose a
novel vector quantization framework that iteratively minimizes quantization
error. First, we provide a detailed review on a relevant vector quantization
method named \textit\{residual vector quantization\} (RVQ). Next, we propose
\textit\{generalized residual vector quantization\} (GRVQ) to further improve
over RVQ. Many vector quantization methods can be viewed as the special cases
of our proposed framework. We evaluate GRVQ on several large scale benchmark
datasets for large scale search, classification and object retrieval. We
compared GRVQ with existing methods in detail. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GRVQ framework substantially outperforms existing methods in
term of quantization accuracy and computation efficiency.
