With the rapid development of mobile Internet and big data, a huge amount of
data is generated in the network, but the data that users are really interested
in a very small portion. To extract the information that users are interested
in from the huge amount of data, the information overload problem needs to be
solved. In the era of mobile internet, the user's characteristics and other
information should be combined in the massive amount of data to quickly and
accurately recommend content to the user, as far as possible to meet the user's
personalized needs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to realize high-speed
and effective retrieval in tens of thousands of micro-videos. Video data
content contains complex meanings, and there are intrinsic connections between
video data. For multimodal information, subspace coding learning is introduced
to build a coding network from public potential representations to multimodal
feature information, taking into account the consistency and complementarity of
information under each modality to obtain a public representation of the
complete eigenvalue. An end-to-end reordering model based on deep learning and
attention mechanism, called interest-related product similarity model based on
multimodal data, is proposed for providing top-N recommendations. The
multimodal feature learning module, interest-related network module and product
similarity recommendation module together form the new model.By conducting
extensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets, the results demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed algorithm and its
effectiveness.
