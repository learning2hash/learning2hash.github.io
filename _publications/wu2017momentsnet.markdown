<p>In this paper, we propose a new simple and learning-free deep
learning network named MomentsNet, whose convolution layer, nonlinear
processing layer and pooling layer are constructed by Moments kernels,
binary hashing and block-wise histogram, respectively. Twelve typical
moments (including geometrical moment, Zernike moment, Tchebichef
moment, etc.) are used to construct the MomentsNet whose recognition
performance for binary image is studied. The results reveal that
MomentsNet has better recognition performance than its corresponding
moments in almost all cases and ZernikeNet achieves the best recognition
performance among MomentsNet constructed by twelve moments. ZernikeNet
also shows better recognition performance on binary image database than
that of PCANet, which is a learning-based deep learning network.</p>
