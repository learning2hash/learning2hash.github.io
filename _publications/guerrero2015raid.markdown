As humans, we regularly interpret images based on the relations between image
regions. For example, a person riding object X, or a plank bridging two
objects. Current methods provide limited support to search for images based on
such relations. We present RAID, a relation-augmented image descriptor that
supports queries based on inter-region relations. The key idea of our
descriptor is to capture the spatial distribution of simple point-to-region
relationships to describe more complex relationships between two image regions.
We evaluate the proposed descriptor by querying into a large subset of the
Microsoft COCO database and successfully extract nontrivial images
demonstrating complex inter-region relations, which are easily missed or
erroneously classified by existing methods.
