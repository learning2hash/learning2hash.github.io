Bit retrieval is the problem of reconstructing a binary sequence from its
periodic autocorrelation, with applications in cryptography and x-ray
crystallography. After defining the problem, with and without noise, we
describe and compare various algorithms for solving it. A geometrical
constraint satisfaction algorithm, relaxed-reflect-reflect, is currently the
best algorithm for noisy bit retrieval.
