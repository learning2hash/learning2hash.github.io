First, a new proof of Berman and Charpin's characterization of the
Reed-Muller codes over the binary field or over an arbitrary prime field is
presented. These codes are considered as the powers of the radical of a modular
algebra. Secondly, the same method is used for the study of the Generalized
Reed-Muller codes over a non prime field.
