This work presents a comparison of machine learning algorithms that are
implemented to segment the characters of text presented as an image. The
algorithms are designed to work on degraded documents with text that is not
aligned in an organized fashion. The paper investigates the use of Support
Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and an Encoder Network to perform
the operation of character spotting. Character Spotting involves extracting
potential characters from a stream of text by selecting regions bound by white
space.
