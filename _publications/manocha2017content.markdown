In this paper, we focus on the problem of content-based retrieval for audio,
which aims to retrieve all semantically similar audio recordings for a given
audio clip query. This problem is similar to the problem of query by example of
audio, which aims to retrieve media samples from a database, which are similar
to the user-provided example. We propose a novel approach which encodes the
audio into a vector representation using Siamese Neural Networks. The goal is
to obtain an encoding similar for files belonging to the same audio class, thus
allowing retrieval of semantically similar audio. Using simple similarity
measures such as those based on simple euclidean distance and cosine similarity
we show that these representations can be very effectively used for retrieving
recordings similar in audio content.
