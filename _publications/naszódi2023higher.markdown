Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set \(S\) in
\(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) is *antipodal of rank \(k\)*, if for any \(k+1\) elements
\(q_1,\ldots q_\{k+1\}\in S\), there is an affine map from \(\mathrm\{conv\}(S)\) to
the \(k\)-dimensional simplex \(\Delta_k\) that maps \(q_1,\ldots q_\{k+1\}\)
bijectively onto the \(k+1\) vertices of \(\Delta_k\). For \(k=1\), it coincides with
the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We
consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal
sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank \(k\) in
\(\mathbb\{R\}^d\)? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of
rank \(k\) and adapting the argument of Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally
developed for the \(k=1\) case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in
the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical
question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower
bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By
connecting rank-\(k\) antipodality to \(k\)-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another
upper bound when \(k>d/2\).
