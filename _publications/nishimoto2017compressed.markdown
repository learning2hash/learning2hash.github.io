We present a novel compressed dynamic self-index for highly repetitive text
collections. Signature encoding is a compressed dynamic self-index for highly
repetitive texts and has a large disadvantage that the pattern search for short
patterns is slow. We improve this disadvantage for faster pattern search by
leveraging an idea behind truncated suffix tree and present the first
compressed dynamic self-index named TST-index that supports not only fast
pattern search but also dynamic update operation of index for highly repetitive
texts. Experiments using a benchmark dataset of highly repetitive texts show
that the pattern search of TST-index is significantly improved.
