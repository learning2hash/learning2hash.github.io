Code retrieval is to find the code snippet from a large corpus of source code
repositories that highly matches the query of natural language description.
Recent work mainly uses natural language processing techniques to process both
query texts (i.e., human natural language) and code snippets (i.e., machine
programming language), however neglecting the deep structured features of query
texts and source codes, both of which contain rich semantic information. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep graph matching and searching (DGMS)
model based on graph neural networks for the task of semantic code retrieval.
To this end, we first represent both natural language query texts and
programming language code snippets with the unified graph-structured data, and
then use the proposed graph matching and searching model to retrieve the best
matching code snippet. In particular, DGMS not only captures more structural
information for individual query texts or code snippets but also learns the
fine-grained similarity between them by cross-attention based semantic matching
operations. We evaluate the proposed DGMS model on two public code retrieval
datasets with two representative programming languages (i.e., Java and Python).
Experiment results demonstrate that DGMS significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models by a large margin on both datasets. Moreover,
our extensive ablation studies systematically investigate and illustrate the
impact of each part of DGMS.
