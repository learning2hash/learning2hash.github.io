Benchmarking recommender system and matrix completion algorithms could be
greatly simplified if the entire matrix was known. We built a \url\{sweetrs.org\}
platform with \(77\) candies and sweets to rank. Over \(2000\) users submitted over
\(44000\) grades resulting in a matrix with \(28%\) coverage. In this report, we
give the full description of the environment and we benchmark the
\textsc\{Soft-Impute\} algorithm on the dataset.
