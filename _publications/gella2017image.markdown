In this paper we propose a model to learn multimodal multilingual
representations for matching images and sentences in different languages, with
the aim of advancing multilingual versions of image search and image
understanding. Our model learns a common representation for images and their
descriptions in two different languages (which need not be parallel) by
considering the image as a pivot between two languages. We introduce a new
pairwise ranking loss function which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric
similarity between the two modalities. We evaluate our models on
image-description ranking for German and English, and on semantic textual
similarity of image descriptions in English. In both cases we achieve
state-of-the-art performance.
