There has been a rapid growth of digitally available music data, including audio
recordings, digitized images of sheet music, album covers and liner notes, and
video clips. This huge amount of data calls for retrieval strategies that allow
users to explore large music collections in a convenient way. More precisely,
there is a need for cross-modal retrieval algorithms that, given a query in one
modality (e.g., a short audio excerpt), find corresponding information and
entities in other modalities (e.g., the name of the piece and the sheet music).
This goes beyond exact audio identification and subsequent retrieval of
metainformation as performed by commercial applications like Shazam [1].
