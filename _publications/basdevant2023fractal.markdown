We study a model of random partitioning by nearest-neighbor coloring from
Poisson rain, introduced independently by Aldous and Preater. Given two initial
points in \([0,1]^d\) respectively colored in red and blue, we let independent
uniformly random points fall in \([0,1]^d\), and upon arrival, each point takes
the color of the nearest point fallen so far. We prove that the colored regions
converge in the Hausdorff sense towards two random closed subsets whose
intersection, the frontier, has Hausdorff dimension strictly between \(d-1\) and
\(d\), thus answering a conjecture raised by Aldous. However, several topological
properties of the frontier remain elusive.
