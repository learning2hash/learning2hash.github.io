Relevance Models are well-known retrieval models and capable of producing
competitive results. However, because they use query expansion they can be very
slow. We address this slowness by incorporating two variants of locality
sensitive hashing (LSH) into the query expansion process. Results on two
document collections suggest that we can obtain large reductions in the amount
of work, with a small reduction in effectiveness. Our approach is shown to be
additive when pruning query terms.
