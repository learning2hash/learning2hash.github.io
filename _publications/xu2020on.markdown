In this paper, we study learning semantic representations for million-scale
free-hand sketches. This is highly challenging due to the domain-unique traits
of sketches, e.g., diverse, sparse, abstract, noisy. We propose a dual-branch
CNNRNN network architecture to represent sketches, which simultaneously encodes
both the static and temporal patterns of sketch strokes. Based on this
architecture, we further explore learning the sketch-oriented semantic
representations in two challenging yet practical settings, i.e., hashing
retrieval and zero-shot recognition on million-scale sketches. Specifically, we
use our dual-branch architecture as a universal representation framework to
design two sketch-specific deep models: (i) We propose a deep hashing model for
sketch retrieval, where a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to
accommodate both the abstract and messy traits of sketches. (ii) We propose a
deep embedding model for sketch zero-shot recognition, via collecting a
large-scale edge-map dataset and proposing to extract a set of semantic vectors
from edge-maps as the semantic knowledge for sketch zero-shot domain alignment.
Both deep models are evaluated by comprehensive experiments on million-scale
sketches and outperform the state-of-the-art competitors.
