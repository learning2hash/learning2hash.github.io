This paper is devoted to studying two main problems: 1) computing the
apparent distance of an Abelian code and 2) giving a notion of Bose,
Ray-Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem (BCH) multivariate code. To do this, we first
strengthen the notion of an apparent distance by introducing the notion of a
strong apparent distance; then, we present an algorithm to compute the strong
apparent distance of an Abelian code, based on some manipulations of
hypermatrices associated with its generating idempotent. Our method uses less
computations than those given by Camion and Sabin; furthermore, in the
bivariate case, the order of computation complexity is reduced from exponential
to linear. Then, we use our techniques to develop a notion of a BCH code in the
multivariate case, and we extend most of the classical results on cyclic BCH
codes. Finally, we apply our method to the design of Abelian codes with maximum
dimension with respect to a fixed apparent distance and a fixed length.
