Cross45;modal hashing has been receiving increasing interests for its low storage cost and fast query speed in multi45;modal data retrievals. However most existing hashing methods are based on hand45;crafted or raw level features of objects which may not be optimally compatible with the coding process. Besides these hashing methods are mainly designed to handle simple pairwise similarity. The complex multilevel ranking semantic structure of instances associated with multiple labels has not been well explored yet. In this paper we propose a ranking45;based deep cross45;modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a semi45;supervised semantic ranking list. Next to expand the semantic representation power of hand45;crafted features RDCMH integrates the semantic ranking information into deep cross45;modal hashing and jointly optimizes the compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions. Experiments on real multi45;modal datasets show that RDCMH outperforms other competitive baselines and achieves the state45;of45;the45;art performance in cross45;modal retrieval applications.
