X-codes form a special class of linear maps which were originally introduced
for data compression in VLSI testing and are also known to give special
parity-check matrices for linear codes suitable for error-erasure channels. In
the context of circuit testing, an \((m, n, d, x)\) X-code compresses \(n\)-bit
output data \(R\) from the circuit under test into \(m\) bits, while allowing for
detecting the existence of an up to \(d\)-bit-wise anomaly in \(R\) even if up to
\(x\) bits of the original uncompressed \(R\) are unknowable to the tester. Using
probabilistic combinatorics, we give a nontrivial lower bound for any \(d \geq
2\) on the maximum number \(n\) of codewords such that an \((m, n, d, 2)\) X-code of
constant weight \(3\) exists. This is the first result that shows the existence
of an infinite sequence of X-codes whose compaction ratio tends to infinity for
any fixed \(d\) under severe weight restrictions. We also give a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm that produces X-codes that achieve our bound.
