Binary codes are constructed from incidence matrices of hypergraphs. A
combinatroial description is given for the minimum distances of such codes via
a combinatorial tool called ``eonv". This combinatorial approach provides a
faster alternative method of finding the minimum distance, which is known to be
a hard problem. This is demonstrated on several classes of codes from
hypergraphs. Moreover, self-duality and self-orthogonality conditions are also
studied through hypergraphs.
