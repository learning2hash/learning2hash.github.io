With the staggering growth in image and video datasets,
algorithms that provide fast similarity search and compact
storage are crucial. Hashing methods that map the
data into Hamming space have shown promise; however,
many of these methods employ a batch-learning strategy
in which the computational cost and memory requirements
may become intractable and infeasible with larger and
larger datasets. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an online learning algorithm based on stochastic gradient
descent in which the hash functions are updated iteratively
with streaming data. In experiments with three image retrieval
benchmarks, our online algorithm attains retrieval
accuracy that is comparable to competing state-of-the-art
batch-learning solutions, while our formulation is orders
of magnitude faster and being online it is adaptable to the
variations of the data. Moreover, our formulation yields improved
retrieval performance over a recently reported online
hashing technique, Online Kernel Hashing.
