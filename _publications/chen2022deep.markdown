In recent years a vast amount of visual content has been generated and shared
from many fields, such as social media platforms, medical imaging, and
robotics. This abundance of content creation and sharing has introduced new
challenges, particularly that of searching databases for similar
content-Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)-a long-established research area
in which improved efficiency and accuracy are needed for real-time retrieval.
Artificial intelligence has made progress in CBIR and has significantly
facilitated the process of instance search. In this survey we review recent
instance retrieval works that are developed based on deep learning algorithms
and techniques, with the survey organized by deep network architecture types,
deep features, feature embedding and aggregation methods, and network
fine-tuning strategies. Our survey considers a wide variety of recent methods,
whereby we identify milestone work, reveal connections among various methods
and present the commonly used benchmarks, evaluation results, common
challenges, and propose promising future directions.
