Due to the compelling efficiency in retrieval and storage similarity45;preserving hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search in large45;scale image retrieval. However existing methods have poor performance in retrieval using an extremely short45;length hash code due to weak ability of classification and poor distribution of hash bit. To address this issue in this study we propose a novel reinforcing short45;length hashing (RSLH). In this proposed RSLH mutual reconstruction between the hash representation and semantic labels is performed to preserve the semantic information. Furthermore to enhance the accuracy of hash representation a pairwise similarity matrix is designed to make a balance between accuracy and training expenditure on memory. In addition a parameter boosting strategy is integrated to reinforce the precision with hash bits fusion. Extensive experiments on three large45;scale image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of RSLH under various short45;length hashing scenarios.
