Sum-rank Hamming codes are introduced in this work. They are essentially
defined as the longest codes (thus of highest information rate) with minimum
sum-rank distance at least \\( 3 \\) (thus one-error-correcting) for a fixed
redundancy \\( r \\), base-field size \\( q \\) and field-extension degree \\( m \\) (i.e.,
number of matrix rows). General upper bounds on their code length, number of
shots or sublengths and average sublength are obtained based on such
parameters. When the field-extension degree is \\( 1 \\), it is shown that sum-rank
isometry classes of sum-rank Hamming codes are in bijective correspondence with
maximal-size partial spreads. In that case, it is also shown that sum-rank
Hamming codes are perfect codes for the sum-rank metric. Also in that case,
estimates on the parameters (lengths and number of shots) of sum-rank Hamming
codes are given, together with an efficient syndrome decoding algorithm. Duals
of sum-rank Hamming codes, called sum-rank simplex codes, are then introduced.
Bounds on the minimum sum-rank distance of sum-rank simplex codes are given
based on known bounds on the size of partial spreads. As applications, sum-rank
Hamming codes are proposed for error correction in multishot
matrix-multiplicative channels and to construct locally repairable codes over
small fields, including binary.
