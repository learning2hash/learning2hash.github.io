The \{\em wavelet tree\} is a flexible data structure that permits representing
sequences \(S[1,n]\) of symbols over an alphabet of size \(\sigma\), within
compressed space and supporting a wide range of operations on \(S\). When
\(\sigma\) is significant compared to \(n\), current wavelet tree representations
incur in noticeable space or time overheads. In this article we introduce the
\{\em wavelet matrix\}, an alternative representation for large alphabets that
retains all the properties of wavelet trees but is significantly faster. We
also show how the wavelet matrix can be compressed up to the zero-order entropy
of the sequence without sacrificing, and actually improving, its time
performance. Our experimental results show that the wavelet matrix outperforms
all the wavelet tree variants along the space/time tradeoff map.
