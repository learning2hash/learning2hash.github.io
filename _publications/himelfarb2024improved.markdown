We study skew-tolerant Gray codes, which are Gray codes in which changes in
consecutive codewords occur in adjacent positions. We present the first
construction of asymptotically non-vanishing skew-tolerant Gray codes, offering
an exponential improvement over the known construction. We also provide
linear-time encoding and decoding algorithms for our codes. Finally, we extend
the definition to non-binary alphabets, and provide constructions of complete
\(m\)-ary skew-tolerant Gray codes for every base \(m\geq 3\).
