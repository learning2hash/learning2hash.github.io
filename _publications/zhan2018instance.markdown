Instance search is an interesting task as well as a challenging issue due to
the lack of effective feature representation. In this paper, an instance level
feature representation built upon fully convolutional instance-aware
segmentation is proposed. The feature is ROI-pooled from the segmented instance
region. So that instances in various sizes and layouts are represented by deep
features in uniform length. This representation is further enhanced by the use
of deformable ResNeXt blocks. Superior performance is observed in terms of its
distinctiveness and scalability on a challenging evaluation dataset built by
ourselves. In addition, the proposed enhancement on the network structure also
shows superior performance on the instance segmentation task.
