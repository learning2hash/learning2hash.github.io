The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since
it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We
present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the
symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are
based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that
these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art
licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and
shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the
performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of
magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on
shared-memory parallel architectures.
