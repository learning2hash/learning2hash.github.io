The number of embeddings of a partially ordered set \\(S\\) in a partially
ordered set \\(T\\) is the number of subposets of \\(T\\) isomorphic to \\(S\\). If both,
\\(S\\) and \\(T\\), have only one unique maximal element, we define good embeddings as
those in which the maximal elements of \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) overlap. We investigate the
number of good and all embeddings of a rooted poset \\(S\\) in the family of all
binary trees on \\(n\\) elements considering two cases: plane (when the order of
descendants matters) and non-plane. Furthermore, we study the number of
embeddings of a rooted poset \\(S\\) in the family of all planted plane trees of
size \\(n\\). We derive the asymptotic behaviour of good and all embeddings in all
cases and we prove that the ratio of good embeddings to all is of the order
\\(\Theta(1/\sqrt\{n\})\\) in all cases, where we provide the exact constants.
Furthermore, we show that this ratio is non-decreasing with \\(S\\) in the plane
binary case and asymptotically non-decreasing with \\(S\\) in the non-plane binary
case and in the planted plane case. Finally, we comment on the case when \\(S\\) is
disconnected.
