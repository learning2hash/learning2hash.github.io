In this work, we propose a fashion item recommendation model that
incorporates hyperbolic geometry into user and item representations. Using
hyperbolic space, our model aims to capture implicit hierarchies among items
based on their visual data and users' purchase history. During training, we
apply a multi-task learning framework that considers both hyperbolic and
Euclidean distances in the loss function. Our experiments on three data sets
show that our model performs better than previous models trained in Euclidean
space only, confirming the effectiveness of our model. Our ablation studies
show that multi-task learning plays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss
substantially deteriorates the model performance.
