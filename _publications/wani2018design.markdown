Obtaining the desired dataset is still a prime challenge faced by researchers
while analyzing Online Social Network (OSN) sites. Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) provided by OSN service providers for retrieving data impose
several unavoidable restrictions which make it difficult to get a desirable
dataset. In this paper, we present an iMacros technology-based data crawler
called IMcrawler, capable of collecting every piece of information which is
accessible through a browser from the Facebook website within the legal
framework which permits access to publicly shared user content on OSNs. The
proposed crawler addresses most of the challenges allied with web data
extraction approaches and most of the APIs provided by OSN service providers.
Two broad sections have been extracted from Facebook user profiles, namely,
Personal Information and Wall Activities. The present work is the first attempt
towards providing the detailed description of crawler design for the Facebook
website.
