<p>The <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-Minimum Values () data
sketch algorithm stores the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> least
hash keys generated by hashing the items in a dataset. We show that
compression based on ordering the keys and encoding successive
differences can offer <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span>
bits per key in expected storage savings, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of unique values in the
data set. We also show that <span class="math inline">\(O(\log
n)\)</span> expected bits saved per key is optimal for any form of
compression for the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> least of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> random values â€“ that the encoding
method is near-optimal among all methods to encode a sketch. We present
a practical method to perform that compression, show that it is
computationally efficient, and demonstrate that its average savings in
practice is within about five percent of the theoretical minimum based
on entropy. We verify that our method outperforms off-the-shelf
compression methods, and we demonstrate that it is practical, using real
and synthetic data.</p>
