This paper demonstrates how simulated images can be useful for object
detection tasks in the agricultural sector, where labeled data can be scarce
and costly to collect. We consider training on mixed datasets with real and
simulated data for strawberry detection in real images. Our results show that
using the real dataset augmented by the simulated dataset resulted in slightly
higher accuracy.
