In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a dominant machine
learning tool for a wide variety of application domains. However, training a
deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data, which is an
expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. Domain
adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging
labeled data in a different, but related source domain, to develop a model for
the target domain. Further, the explosive growth of digital data has posed a
fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage
and retrieval efficiency, recent years have witnessed a wide application of
hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper, we first
introduce a new dataset, Office-Home, to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms.
The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple
domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit
labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes,
to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of
deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain
adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks
corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes
which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain
adaptation.
