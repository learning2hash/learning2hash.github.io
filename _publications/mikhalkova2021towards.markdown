Literary texts are usually rich in meanings and their interpretation
complicates corpus studies and automatic processing. There have been several
attempts to create collections of literary texts with annotation of literary
elements like the author's speech, characters, events, scenes etc. However,
they resulted in small collections and standalone rules for annotation. The
present article describes an experiment on lexical annotation of text worlds in
a literary work and quantitative methods of their comparison. The experiment
shows that for a well-agreed tag assignment annotation rules should be set much
more strictly. However, if borders between text worlds and other elements are
the result of a subjective interpretation, they should be modeled as fuzzy
entities.
