We address the task of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) for noisy text. We
present WikilinksNED, a large-scale NED dataset of text fragments from the web,
which is significantly noisier and more challenging than existing news-based
datasets. To capture the limited and noisy local context surrounding each
mention, we design a neural model and train it with a novel method for sampling
informative negative examples. We also describe a new way of initializing word
and entity embeddings that significantly improves performance. Our model
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on WikilinksNED
while achieving comparable performance on a smaller newswire dataset.
