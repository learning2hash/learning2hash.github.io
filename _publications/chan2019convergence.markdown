It is known that the empirical spectral distribution of random matrices
obtained from linear codes of increasing length converges to the well-known
Marchenko-Pastur law, if the Hamming distance of the dual codes is at least 5.
In this paper, we prove that the convergence in probability is at least of the
order \\(n^\{-1/4\}\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of the code.
