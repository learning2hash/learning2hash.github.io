Polysemy is a very common phenomenon in modern languages. Under many
circumstances, there exists a primal meaning for the expression. We define the
primal meaning of an expression to be a frequently used sense of that
expression from which its other frequent senses can be deduced. Many of the new
appearing meanings of the expressions are either originated from a primal
meaning, or are merely literal references to the original expression, e.g.,
apple (fruit), Apple (Inc), and Apple (movie). When constructing a knowledge
base from on-line encyclopedia data, it would be more efficient to be aware of
the information about the importance of the senses. In this paper, we would
like to explore a way to automatically recommend the primal meaning of an
expression based on the textual descriptions of the multiple senses of an
expression from on-line encyclopedia websites. We propose a hybrid model that
captures both the pattern of the description and the relationship between
different descriptions with both weakly supervised and unsupervised models. The
experiment results show that our method yields a good result with a P@1
(precision) score of 83.3 per cent, and a MAP (mean average precision) of 90.5
per cent, surpassing the UMFS-WE baseline by a big margin (P@1 is 61.1 per cent
and MAP is 76.3 per cent).
