Due to exponential growth of complex data, graph structure has become
increasingly important to model various entities and their interactions, with
many interesting applications including, bioinformatics, social network
analysis, etc. Depending on the complexity of the data, the underlying graph
model can be a simple directed/undirected and/or weighted/un-weighted graph to
a complex graph (aka multi-attributed graph) where vertices and edges are
labelled with multi-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we present a novel
weighted distance measure based on weighted Euclidean norm which is defined as
a function of both vertex and edge attributes, and it can be used for various
graph analysis tasks including classification and cluster analysis. The
proposed distance measure has flexibility to increase/decrease the weightage of
edge labels while calculating the distance between vertex-pairs. We have also
proposed a MAGDist algorithm, which reads multi-attributed graph stored in CSV
files containing the list of vertex vectors and edge vectors, and calculates
the distance between each vertex-pair using the proposed weighted distance
measure. Finally, we have proposed a multi-attributed similarity graph
generation algorithm, MAGSim, which reads the output of MAGDist algorithm and
generates a similarity graph that can be analysed using classification and
clustering algorithms. The significance and accuracy of the proposed distance
measure and algorithms is evaluated on Iris and Twitter data sets, and it is
found that the similarity graph generated by our proposed method yields better
clustering results than the existing similarity graph generation methods.
