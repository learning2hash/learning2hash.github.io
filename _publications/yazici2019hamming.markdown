Let \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\) be the finite field of order \(q\) and \(E\subset
\mathbb\{F\}_q^d\), where \(4|d\). Using Fourier analytic techniques, we prove that
if \(|E|>\frac\{q^\{d-1\}\}\{d\}\binom\{d\}\{d/2\}\binom\{d/2\}\{d/4\}\), then the points of
\(E\) determine a Hamming distance \(r\) for every even \(r\).
