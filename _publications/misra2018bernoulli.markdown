Just as semantic hashing can accelerate information retrieval, binary valued
embeddings can significantly reduce latency in the retrieval of graphical data.
We introduce a simple but effective model for learning such binary vectors for
nodes in a graph. By imagining the embeddings as independent coin flips of
varying bias, continuous optimization techniques can be applied to the
approximate expected loss. Embeddings optimized in this fashion consistently
outperform the quantization of both spectral graph embeddings and various
learned real-valued embeddings, on both ranking and pre-ranking tasks for a
variety of datasets.
