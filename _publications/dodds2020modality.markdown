Image retrieval with natural language feedback offers the promise of catalog
search based on fine-grained visual features that go beyond objects and binary
attributes, facilitating real-world applications such as e-commerce. Our
Modality-Agnostic Attention Fusion (MAAF) model combines image and text
features and outperforms existing approaches on two visual search with
modifying phrase datasets, Fashion IQ and CSS, and performs competitively on a
dataset with only single-word modifications, Fashion200k. We also introduce two
new challenging benchmarks adapted from Birds-to-Words and Spot-the-Diff, which
provide new settings with rich language inputs, and we show that our approach
without modification outperforms strong baselines. To better understand our
model, we conduct detailed ablations on Fashion IQ and provide visualizations
of the surprising phenomenon of words avoiding "attending" to the image region
they refer to.
