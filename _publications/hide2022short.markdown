We study the number of short geodesics and small eigenvalues on
Weil-Petersson random genus zero hyperbolic surfaces with \(n\) cusps in the
regime \(n\to\infty\). Inspired by work of Mirzakhani and Petri \cite\{Mi.Pe19\},
we show that the random multi-set of lengths of closed geodesics converges,
after a suitable rescaling, to a Poisson point process with explicit intensity.
As a consequence, we show that the Weil-Petersson probability that a hyperbolic
punctured sphere with \(n\) cusps has at least \(k=o(n)\) arbitrarily small
eigenvalues tends to \(1\) as \(n\to\infty\).
