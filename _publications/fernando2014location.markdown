Would it be possible to automatically associate ancient pictures to modern
ones and create fancy cultural heritage city maps? We introduce here the task
of recognizing the location depicted in an old photo given modern annotated
images collected from the Internet. We present an extensive analysis on
different features, looking for the most discriminative and most robust to the
image variability induced by large time lags. Moreover, we show that the
described task benefits from domain adaptation.
