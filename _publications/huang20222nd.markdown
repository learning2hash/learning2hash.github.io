Image representations are a critical building block of computer vision
applications. This paper presents the 2nd place solution to the Google
Universal Image Embedding Competition, which is part of the ECCV2022
instance-level recognition workshops. We use the instance-level fine-grained
image classification method to complete this competition. We focus on data
building and processing, model structure, and training strategies. Finally, the
solution scored 0.713 on the public leaderboard and 0.709 on the private
leaderboard.
