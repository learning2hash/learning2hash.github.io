Linear complementary dual codes (or codes with complementary duals) are codes
whose intersections with their dual codes are trivial. We study binary linear
complementary dual \([n,k]\) codes with the largest minimum weight among all
binary linear complementary dual \([n,k]\) codes. We characterize binary linear
complementary dual codes with the largest minimum weight for small dimensions.
A complete classification of binary linear complementary dual \([n,k]\) codes
with the largest minimum weight is also given for \(1 \le k \le n \le 16\).
