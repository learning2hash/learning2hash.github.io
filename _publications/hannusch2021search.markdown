A self-dual binary linear code is called Type I code if it has singly-even
codewords, i.e.~it has codewords with weight divisible by \(2.\) The purpose of
this paper is to investigate interesting properties of Type I codes of
different lengths. Further, we build up a computer-based code-searching program
based on our knowledge about Type I codes. Some computation results achieved by
this program are given.
