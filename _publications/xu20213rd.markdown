In this paper, we show our solution to the Google Landmark Recognition 2021
Competition. Firstly, embeddings of images are extracted via various
architectures (i.e. CNN-, Transformer- and hybrid-based), which are optimized
by ArcFace loss. Then we apply an efficient pipeline to re-rank predictions by
adjusting the retrieval score with classification logits and non-landmark
distractors. Finally, the ensembled model scores 0.489 on the private
leaderboard, achieving the 3rd place in the 2021 edition of the Google Landmark
Recognition Competition.
