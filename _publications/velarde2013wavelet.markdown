The aim of this study is to evaluate a machine-learning method in which
symbolic representations of folk songs are segmented and classified into tune
families with Haar-wavelet filtering. The method is compared with previously
proposed Gestalt-based method. Melodies are represented as discrete symbolic
pitch-time signals. We apply the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the
Haar wavelet at specific scales, obtaining filtered versions of melodies
emphasizing their information at particular time-scales. We use the filtered
signal for representation and segmentation, using the wavelet coefficients'
local maxima to indicate local boundaries and classify segments by means of
k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics (Euclidean, cityblock),
and compare the results to a Gestalt-based segmentation method and metrics
applied directly to the pitch signal. We found that the wavelet based
segmentation and wavelet-filtering of the pitch signal lead to better
classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation when the time-scale and
other parameters are optimized.
