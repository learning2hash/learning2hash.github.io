We present the ALTO dataset, a vision-focused dataset for the development and
benchmarking of Visual Place Recognition and Localization methods for Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles. The dataset is composed of two long (approximately 150km and
260km) trajectories flown by a helicopter over Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it
includes high precision GPS-INS ground truth location data, high precision
accelerometer readings, laser altimeter readings, and RGB downward facing
camera imagery. In addition, we provide reference imagery over the flight
paths, which makes this dataset suitable for VPR benchmarking and other tasks
common in Localization, such as image registration and visual odometry. To the
author's knowledge, this is the largest real-world aerial-vehicle dataset of
this kind. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/MetaSLAM/ALTO.
