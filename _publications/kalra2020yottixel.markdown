With the emergence of digital pathology, searching for similar images in
large archives has gained considerable attention. Image retrieval can provide
pathologists with unprecedented access to the evidence embodied in already
diagnosed and treated cases from the past. This paper proposes a search engine
specialized for digital pathology, called Yottixel, a portmanteau for "one
yotta pixel," alluding to the big-data nature of histopathology images. The
most impressive characteristic of Yottixel is its ability to represent whole
slide images (WSIs) in a compact manner. Yottixel can perform millions of
searches in real-time with a high search accuracy and low storage profile.
Yottixel uses an intelligent indexing algorithm capable of representing WSIs
with a mosaic of patches by converting them into a small number of methodically
extracted barcodes, called "Bunch of Barcodes" (BoB), the most prominent
performance enabler of Yottixel. The performance of the prototype platform is
qualitatively tested using 300 WSIs from the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (UPMC) and 2,020 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)
provided by the National Cancer Institute. Both datasets amount to more than
4,000,000 patches of 1000x1000 pixels. We report three sets of experiments that
show that Yottixel can accurately retrieve organs and malignancies, and its
semantic ordering shows good agreement with the subjective evaluation of human
observers.
