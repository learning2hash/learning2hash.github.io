While humor is often thought to be beyond the reach of Natural Language
Processing, we show that several aspects of single-word humor correlate with
simple linear directions in Word Embeddings. In particular: (a) the word
vectors capture multiple aspects discussed in humor theories from various
disciplines; (b) each individual's sense of humor can be represented by a
vector, which can predict differences in people's senses of humor on new,
unrated, words; and (c) upon clustering humor ratings of multiple demographic
groups, different humor preferences emerge across the different groups. Humor
ratings are taken from the work of Engelthaler and Hills (2017) as well as from
an original crowdsourcing study of 120,000 words. Our dataset further includes
annotations for the theoretically-motivated humor features we identify.
