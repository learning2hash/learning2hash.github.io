International library standards require cataloguers to tediously input
Romanization of their catalogue records for the benefit of library users
without specific language expertise. In this paper, we present the first
reported results on the task of automatic Romanization of undiacritized Arabic
bibliographic entries. This complex task requires the modeling of Arabic
phonology, morphology, and even semantics. We collected a 2.5M word corpus of
parallel Arabic and Romanized bibliographic entries, and benchmarked a number
of models that vary in terms of complexity and resource dependence. Our best
system reaches 89.3% exact word Romanization on a blind test set. We make our
data and code publicly available.
