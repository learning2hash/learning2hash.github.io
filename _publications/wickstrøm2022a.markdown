Deep learning-based approaches for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of CT
liver images is an active field of research, but suffers from some critical
limitations. First, they are heavily reliant on labeled data, which can be
challenging and costly to acquire. Second, they lack transparency and
explainability, which limits the trustworthiness of deep CBIR systems. We
address these limitations by (1) proposing a self-supervised learning framework
that incorporates domain-knowledge into the training procedure and (2)
providing the first representation learning explainability analysis in the
context of CBIR of CT liver images. Results demonstrate improved performance
compared to the standard self-supervised approach across several metrics, as
well as improved generalisation across datasets. Further, we conduct the first
representation learning explainability analysis in the context of CBIR, which
reveals new insights into the feature extraction process. Lastly, we perform a
case study with cross-examination CBIR that demonstrates the usability of our
proposed framework. We believe that our proposed framework could play a vital
role in creating trustworthy deep CBIR systems that can successfully take
advantage of unlabeled data.
