Digital libraries often face the challenge of processing a large volume of
diverse document types. The manual collection and tagging of metadata can be a
time-consuming and error-prone task. To address this, we aim to develop an
automatic metadata extractor for digital libraries. In this work, we introduce
the Heterogeneous Learning Resources (HLR) dataset designed for document image
classification. The approach involves decomposing individual learning resources
into constituent document images (sheets). These images are then processed
through an OCR tool to extract textual representation. State-of-the-art
classifiers are employed to classify both the document image and its textual
content. Subsequently, the labels of the constituent document images are
utilized to predict the label of the overall document.
