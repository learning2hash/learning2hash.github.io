Lifelogging is a process of collecting rich source of information about daily
life of people. In this paper, we introduce the problem of sentiment analysis
in egocentric events focusing on the moments that compose the images recalling
positive, neutral or negative feelings to the observer. We propose a method for
the classification of the sentiments in egocentric pictures based on global and
semantic image features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks. We carried
out experiments on an egocentric dataset, which we organized in 3 classes on
the basis of the sentiment that is recalled to the user (positive, negative or
neutral).
