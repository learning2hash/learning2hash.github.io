Unsupervised embedding learning aims to extract good representation from data
without the need for any manual labels, which has been a critical challenge in
many supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes a new unsupervised
embedding approach, called Super-AND, which extends the current
state-of-the-art model. Super-AND has its unique set of losses that can gather
similar samples nearby within a low-density space while keeping invariant
features intact against data augmentation. Super-AND outperforms all existing
approaches and achieves an accuracy of 89.2% on the image classification task
for CIFAR-10. We discuss the practical implications of this method in assisting
semi-supervised tasks.
