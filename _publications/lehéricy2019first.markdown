We consider large random planar maps and study the first-passage percolation
distance obtained by assigning independent identically distributed lengths to
the edges. We consider the cases of quadrangulations and of general planar
maps. In both cases, the first-passage percolation distance is shown to behave
in large scales like a constant times the usual graph distance. We apply our
method to the metric properties of the classical Tutte bijection between
quadrangulations with \(n\) faces and general planar maps with \(n\) edges. We
prove that the respective graph distances on the quadrangulation and on the
associated general planar map are in large scales equivalent when \(n \to
\infty\).
