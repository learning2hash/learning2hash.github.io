This article presents a novel approach to estimate semantic entity similarity
using entity features available as Linked Data. The key idea is to exploit
ranked lists of features, extracted from Linked Data sources, as a
representation of the entities to be compared. The similarity between two
entities is then estimated by comparing their ranked lists of features. The
article describes experiments with museum data from DBpedia, with datasets from
a LOD catalog, and with computer science conferences from the DBLP repository.
The experiments demonstrate that entity similarity, computed using ranked lists
of features, achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art measures.
