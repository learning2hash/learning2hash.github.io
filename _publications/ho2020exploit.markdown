Multiview recognition has been well studied in the literature and achieves
decent performance in object recognition and retrieval task. However, most
previous works rely on supervised learning and some impractical underlying
assumptions, such as the availability of all views in training and inference
time. In this work, the problem of multiview self-supervised learning (MV-SSL)
is investigated, where only image to object association is given. Given this
setup, a novel surrogate task for self-supervised learning is proposed by
pursuing "object invariant" representation. This is solved by randomly
selecting an image feature of an object as object prototype, accompanied with
multiview consistency regularization, which results in view invariant
stochastic prototype embedding (VISPE). Experiments shows that the recognition
and retrieval results using VISPE outperform that of other self-supervised
learning methods on seen and unseen data. VISPE can also be applied to
semi-supervised scenario and demonstrates robust performance with limited data
available. Code is available at https://github.com/chihhuiho/VISPE
