Given an infinite connected graph, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to
assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges. An open question attributed to
Furstenberg is whether there exists a two-sided infinite geodesic in first
passage percolation on Z^2, and more generally on Z^n for n>1. Although the
answer is generally conjectured to be negative, we give a positive answer for
graphs satisfying some negative curvature assumption. Assuming only strict
positivity and finite expectation of the random lengths, we prove that if a
graph X has bounded degree and contains a Morse geodesic (e.g. is
non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic), then almost surely, there exists a
bi-infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on X.
