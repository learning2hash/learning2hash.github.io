For nonnegative integers \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(n,d)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} be the maximum cardinality of a binary code of length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and minimum distance at least \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We consider a slight sharpening of the semidefinite programming bound of Gijswijt, Mittelmann and Schrijver, and obtain that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(18,8)\leq 70\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
