<p>For nonnegative integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(A(n,d)\)</span> be the maximum cardinality of a
binary code of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and minimum
distance at least <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. We consider a
slight sharpening of the semidefinite programming bound of Gijswijt,
Mittelmann and Schrijver, and obtain that <span
class="math inline">\(A(18,8)\leq 70\)</span>.</p>
