For nonnegative integers \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}n\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} and \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}d\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}, let \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}A(n,d)\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} be the maximum cardinality of a binary code of length \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}n\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} and minimum distance at least \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}d\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}. We consider a slight sharpening of the semidefinite programming bound of Gijswijt, Mittelmann and Schrijver, and obtain that \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}A(18,8)\leq 70\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}.
