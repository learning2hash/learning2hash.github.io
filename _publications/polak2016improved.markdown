For nonnegative integers \\(n\\) and \\(d\\), let \\(A(n,d)\\) be the maximum cardinality
of a binary code of length \\(n\\) and minimum distance at least \\(d\\). We consider a
slight sharpening of the semidefinite programming bound of Gijswijt, Mittelmann
and Schrijver, and obtain that \\(A(18,8)\leq 70\\).
