We analyzed a large selection of classical musical pieces composed by Bach,
Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert and Tchaikovsky, and found a surprising connection
with mathematics. For each composer, we extracted the time intervals each note
was played in each piece and found that the corresponding data sets are Benford
distributed. Remarkably, the logarithmic distribution is present not only for
the leading digits, but also for all digits.
