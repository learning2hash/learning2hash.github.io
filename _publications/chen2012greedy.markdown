<p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has attracted great attention
recently in machine learning community. However, most MIL algorithms are
very slow and cannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we
propose a greedy strategy to speed up the multiple instance learning
process. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a density ratio
model, and show that maximizing a density ratio function is the low
bound of the DD model under certain conditions. Secondly, we make use of
a histogram ratio between positive bags and negative bags to represent
the density ratio function and find codebooks separately for positive
bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. For testing, we make use of
a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. We test our method on
both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11 dataset. The
experimental results show that our method yields comparable accuracy to
the current state of the art, while being up to at least one order of
magnitude faster.</p>
