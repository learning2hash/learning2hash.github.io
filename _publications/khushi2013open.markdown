Virtual microscopy includes digitisation of histology slides and the use of
computer technologies for complex investigation of diseases such as cancer.
However, automated image analysis, or website publishing of such digital
images, is hampered by their large file sizes. We have developed two Java based
open source tools: Snapshot Creator and NDPI-Splitter. Snapshot Creator
converts a portion of a large digital slide into a desired quality JPEG image.
The image is linked to the patients clinical and treatment information in a
customised open source cancer data management software (Caisis) in use at the
Australian Breast Cancer Tissue Bank (ABCTB) and then published on the ABCTB
website www.abctb.org.au using Deep Zoom open source technology. Using the
ABCTB online search engine, digital images can be searched by defining various
criteria such as cancer type, or biomarkers expressed. NDPI-Splitter splits a
large image file into smaller sections of TIFF images so that they can be
easily analysed by image analysis software such as Metamorph or Matlab.
NDPI-Splitter also has the capacity to filter out empty images. Snapshot
Creator and NDPI-Splitter are novel open source Java tools. They convert
digital slides into files of smaller size for further processing. In
conjunction with other open source tools such as Deep Zoom and Caisis, this
suite of tools is used for the management and archiving of digital microscopy
images, enabling digitised images to be explored and zoomed online. Our online
image repository also has the capacity to be used as a teaching resource. These
tools also enable large files to be sectioned for image analysis.
