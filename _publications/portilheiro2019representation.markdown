We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that
can capture "flexible" notions of containment. We formalize this problem via a
measure theoretic definition of multisets, and obtain a theoretically-motivated
learning model. We propose training this model on a novel task: predicting the
size of the symmetric difference (or intersection) between pairs of multisets.
We demonstrate that our model not only performs very well on predicting
containment relations (and more effectively predicts the sizes of symmetric
differences and intersections than DeepSets-based approaches with unconstrained
object representations), but that it also learns meaningful representations.
