Consistent Hashing functions are widely used for load balancing across a variety of applications. However, the original presentation and typical implementations of Consistent Hashing rely on randomised allocation of hash codes to keys which results in a flawed and approximately-uniform allocation of keys to hash codes. We analyse the desired properties and present an algorithm that perfectly achieves them without resorting to any random distributions. The algorithm is simple and adds to our understanding of what is necessary to create a consistent hash function.
