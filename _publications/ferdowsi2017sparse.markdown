This paper addresses the problem of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search
in pattern recognition where feature vectors in a database are encoded as
compact codes in order to speed-up the similarity search in large-scale
databases. Considering the ANN problem from an information-theoretic
perspective, we interpret it as an encoding, which maps the original feature
vectors to a less entropic sparse representation while requiring them to be as
informative as possible. We then define the coding gain for ANN search using
information-theoretic measures. We next show that the classical approach to
this problem, which consists of binarization of the projected vectors is
sub-optimal. Instead, a properly designed ternary encoding achieves higher
coding gains and lower complexity.
