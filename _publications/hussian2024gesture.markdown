Recognizing gestures in artworks can add a valuable dimension to art
understanding and help to acknowledge the role of the sense of smell in
cultural heritage. We propose a method to recognize smell gestures in
historical artworks. We show that combining local features with global image
context improves classification performance notably on different backbones.
