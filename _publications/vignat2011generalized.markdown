In a recent paper, Michalowicz et al. provide an extension of Isserlis
theorem to the case of a Bernoulli location mixture of a Gaussian vector. We
extend here this result to the case of any location mixture of Gaussian vector;
we also provide an example of the Isserlis theorem for a "scale location"
mixture of Gaussian, namely the d-dimensional generalized hyperbolic
distribution.
