Distance-based dynamic texture recognition is an important research field in
multimedia processing with applications ranging from retrieval to segmentation
of video data. Based on the conjecture that the most distinctive characteristic
of a dynamic texture is the appearance of its individual frames, this work
proposes to describe dynamic textures as kernelized spaces of frame-wise
feature vectors computed using the Scattering transform. By combining these
spaces with a basis-invariant metric, we get a framework that produces
competitive results for nearest neighbor classification and state-of-the-art
results for nearest class center classification.
