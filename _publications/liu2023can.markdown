With the rapid development of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technologies and neural networks we can explore more appropriate data structures and algorithms. Recent progress shows that neural networks can partly replace traditional data structures. In this paper we proposed a novel DNN (Deep Neural Network)45;based learned locality45;sensitive hashing called LLSH to efficiently and flexibly map high45;dimensional data to low45;dimensional space. LLSH replaces the traditional LSH (Locality45;sensitive Hashing) function families with parallel multi45;layer neural networks which reduces the time and memory consumption and guarantees query accuracy simultaneously. The proposed LLSH demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the hash index with learning45;based neural networks and open a new door for developers to design and configure data organization more accurately to improve information45;searching performance. Extensive experiments on different types of datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in query accuracy time consumption and memory usage.
