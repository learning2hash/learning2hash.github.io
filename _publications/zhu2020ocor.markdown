Code retrieval helps developers reuse the code snippet in the open-source
projects. Given a natural language description, code retrieval aims to search
for the most relevant code among a set of code. Existing state-of-the-art
approaches apply neural networks to code retrieval. However, these approaches
still fail to capture an important feature: overlaps. The overlaps between
different names used by different people indicate that two different names may
be potentially related (e.g., "message" and "msg"), and the overlaps between
identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that
the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address
these problems, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR, where we
introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first
embeds identifiers by character to capture the overlaps between identifiers,
and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of
overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier.
  The evaluation was conducted on two established datasets. The experimental
results show that OCoR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieves 13.1% to 22.3% improvements. Moreover, we also
conducted several in-depth experiments to help understand the performance of
different components in OCoR.
