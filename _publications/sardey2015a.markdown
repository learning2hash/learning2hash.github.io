    Basic group of visual techniques such as color, shape, texture are used in Content Based Image Retrievals (CBIR) to retrieve query image or subregion of image to find similar images in image database. To improve query result, relevance feedback is used many times in CBIR to help user to express their preference and improve query results.In this paper, a new approach for image retrieval is proposed which is based on the features such as Color Histogram, Eigen Values and Match Point. Images from various types of database are first identified by using edge detection techniques.Once the image is identified, then the image is searched in the particular database, then all related images are displayed. This will save the retrieval time. Further to retrieve the precise query image, any of the three techniques are used and comparison is done w.r.t. average retrieval time. Eigen value technique found to be the best as compared with other two techniques
