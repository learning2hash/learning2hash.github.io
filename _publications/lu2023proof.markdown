In this paper, we completely determine the number of solutions to \(
\operatorname\{Tr\}^\{q^2\}_q(bx+b)+c=0, x\in \mu_\{q+1\}\backslash \\{-1\\}\) for all
\(b\in \mathbb\{F\}_\{q^2\}, c\in\mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}\). As an application, we can give the
weight distributions of a class of linear codes, and give a completely answer
to a recent conjecture about a class of NMDS codes proposed by Heng.
