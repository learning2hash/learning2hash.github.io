Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is an essential part of computer vision
research, especially in medical expert systems. Having a discriminative image
descriptor with the least number of parameters for tuning is desirable in CBIR
systems. In this paper, we introduce a new simple descriptor based on the
histogram of local Radon projections. We also propose a very fast
convolution-based local Radon estimator to overcome the slow process of Radon
projections. We performed our experiments using pathology images (KimiaPath24)
and lung CT patches and test our proposed solution for medical image
processing. We achieved superior results compared with other histogram-based
descriptors such as LBP and HoG as well as some pre-trained CNNs.
