In the past few years, there has been a dramatic growth in e-manga
(electronic Japanese-style comics). Faced with the booming demand for manga
research and the large amount of unlabeled manga data, we raised a new task,
called unsupervised manga character re-identification. However, the artistic
expression and stylistic limitations of manga pose many challenges to the
re-identification problem. Inspired by the idea that some content-related
features may help clustering, we propose a Face-body and Spatial-temporal
Associated Clustering method (FSAC). In the face-body combination module, a
face-body graph is constructed to solve problems such as exaggeration and
deformation in artistic creation by using the integrity of the image. In the
spatial-temporal relationship correction module, we analyze the appearance
features of characters and design a temporal-spatial-related triplet loss to
fine-tune the clustering. Extensive experiments on a manga book dataset with
109 volumes validate the superiority of our method in unsupervised manga
character re-identification.
