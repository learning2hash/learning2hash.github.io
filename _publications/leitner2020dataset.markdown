We describe a dataset developed for Named Entity Recognition in German
federal court decisions. It consists of approx. 67,000 sentences with over 2
million tokens. The resource contains 54,000 manually annotated entities,
mapped to 19 fine-grained semantic classes: person, judge, lawyer, country,
city, street, landscape, organization, company, institution, court, brand, law,
ordinance, European legal norm, regulation, contract, court decision, and legal
literature. The legal documents were, furthermore, automatically annotated with
more than 35,000 TimeML-based time expressions. The dataset, which is available
under a CC-BY 4.0 license in the CoNNL-2002 format, was developed for training
an NER service for German legal documents in the EU project Lynx.
