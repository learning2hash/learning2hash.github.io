In this work, we explore a genre of puzzles ("image riddles") which involves
a set of images and a question. Answering these puzzles require both
capabilities involving visual detection (including object, activity
recognition) and, knowledge-based or commonsense reasoning. We compile a
dataset of over 3k riddles where each riddle consists of 4 images and a
groundtruth answer. The annotations are validated using crowd-sourced
evaluation. We also define an automatic evaluation metric to track future
progress. Our task bears similarity with the commonly known IQ tasks such as
analogy solving, sequence filling that are often used to test intelligence.
  We develop a Probabilistic Reasoning-based approach that utilizes
probabilistic commonsense knowledge to answer these riddles with a reasonable
accuracy. We demonstrate the results of our approach using both automatic and
human evaluations. Our approach achieves some promising results for these
riddles and provides a strong baseline for future attempts. We make the entire
dataset and related materials publicly available to the community in
ImageRiddle Website (http://bit.ly/22f9Ala).
