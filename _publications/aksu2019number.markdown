Let \\(G\\) be a finite abelian group. Ferraz, Guerreiro and Polcino Milies prove
that the number of \\(G\\)-equivalence classes of minimal abelian codes is equal to
the number of \\(G\\)-isomorphism classes of subgroups for which corresponding
quotients are cyclic. In this article, we prove that the notion of
\\(G\\)-isomorphism is equivalent to the notion of isomorphism on the set of all
subgroups \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) with the property that \\(G/H\\) is cyclic. As an application,
we calculate the number of non-\\(G\\)-equivalent minimal abelian codes for some
specific family of abelian groups. We also prove that the number of
non-\\(G\\)-equivalent minimal abelian codes is equal to number of divisors of the
exponent of \\(G\\) if and only if for each prime \\(p\\) dividing the order of \\(G\\),
the Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of \\(G\\) are homocyclic.
