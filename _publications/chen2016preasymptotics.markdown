In this paper, we obtain the preasymptotic and asymptotic behavior and strong
equivalences of the approximation numbers of the embeddings from the
anisotropic Sobolev spaces \(W_2^\{\bf R\}(\Bbb T^d)\) to \(L_2(\Bbb T^d)\). We also
get the preasymptotic behavior of the approximation numbers of the embeddings
from the limit spaces \(W_2^\{\infty\}(\Bbb T^d)\) of the anisotropic Sobolev
spaces \(W_2^\{\bf R\}(\Bbb T^d)\) to \(L_2(\Bbb T^d)\). We show that both the above
embedding problems are intractable and do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality.
