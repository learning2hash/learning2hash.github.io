Let \\(\pi_n\\) be a uniformly chosen random permutation on \\([n]\\). Using an
analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive \\(k\\)-permutations
are order isomorphic, we show that the expected number of distinct consecutive
patterns in \\(\pi_n\\) is \\(\frac\{n^2\}\{2\}(1-o(1))\\). This exhibits the fact that
random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly.
