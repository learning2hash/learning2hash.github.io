Virtual try-on under arbitrary poses has attracted lots of research attention
due to its huge potential applications. However, existing methods can hardly
preserve the details in clothing texture and facial identity (face, hair) while
fitting novel clothes and poses onto a person. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-stage framework to synthesize person images, where rich details in
salient regions can be well preserved. Specifically, a multi-stage framework is
proposed to decompose the generation into spatial alignment followed by a
coarse-to-fine generation. To better preserve the details in salient areas such
as clothing and facial areas, we propose a Tree-Block (tree dilated fusion
block) to harness multi-scale features in the generator networks. With
end-to-end training of multiple stages, the whole framework can be jointly
optimized for results with significantly better visual fidelity and richer
details. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance, especially in
preserving the visual details in clothing texture and facial identity. Our
implementation will be publicly available soon.
