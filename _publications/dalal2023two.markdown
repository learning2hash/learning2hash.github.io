<p>We introduce linear probing hashing schemes that construct a hash
table of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, with constant load
factor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, on which the
worst-case unsuccessful search time is asymptotically almost surely
<span class="math inline">\(O(\log \log n)\)</span>. The schemes employ
two linear probe sequences to find empty cells for the keys. Matching
lower bounds on the maximum cluster size produced by any algorithm that
uses two linear probe sequences are obtained as well.</p>
