We introduce linear probing hashing schemes that construct a hash table of size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, with constant load factor \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\alpha\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, on which the worst-case unsuccessful search time is asymptotically almost surely \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(\log \log n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The schemes employ two linear probe sequences to find empty cells for the keys. Matching lower bounds on the maximum cluster size produced by any algorithm that uses two linear probe sequences are obtained as well.
