We introduce linear probing hashing schemes that construct a hash table of
size \\(n\\), with constant load factor \\(\alpha\\), on which the worst-case
unsuccessful search time is asymptotically almost surely \\(O(log log n)\\). The
schemes employ two linear probe sequences to find empty cells for the keys.
Matching lower bounds on the maximum cluster size produced by any algorithm
that uses two linear probe sequences are obtained as well.
