Over the past three years Pinterest has experimented with several visual
search and recommendation services, including Related Pins (2014), Similar
Looks (2015), Flashlight (2016) and Lens (2017). This paper presents an
overview of our visual discovery engine powering these services, and shares the
rationales behind our technical and product decisions such as the use of object
detection and interactive user interfaces. We conclude that this visual
discovery engine significantly improves engagement in both search and
recommendation tasks.
