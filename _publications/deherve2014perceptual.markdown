This paper proposes a novel approach for storing and retrieving massive DNA
sequences.. The method is based on a perceptual hash function, commonly used to
determine the similarity between digital images, that we adapted for DNA
sequences. Perceptual hash function presented here is based on a Discrete
Cosine Transform Sign Only (DCT-SO). Each nucleotide is encoded as a fixed gray
level intensity pixel and the hash is calculated from its significant frequency
characteristics. This results to a drastic data reduction between the sequence
and the perceptual hash. Unlike cryptographic hash functions, perceptual hashes
are not affected by "avalanche effect" and thus can be compared. The similarity
distance between two hashes is estimated with the Hamming Distance, which is
used to retrieve DNA sequences. Experiments that we conducted show that our
approach is relevant for storing massive DNA sequences, and retrieving them.
