We consider the storage-retrieval rate tradeoff in private information
retrieval (PIR) systems using a Shannon-theoretic approach. Our focus is mostly
on the canonical two-message two-database case, for which a coding scheme based
on random codebook generation and the binning technique is proposed. This
coding scheme reveals a hidden connection between PIR and the classic multiple
description source coding problem. We first show that when the retrieval rate
is kept optimal, the proposed non-linear scheme can achieve better performance
over any linear scheme. Moreover, a non-trivial storage-retrieval rate tradeoff
can be achieved beyond space-sharing between this extreme point and the other
optimal extreme point, achieved by the retrieve-everything strategy. We further
show that with a method akin to the expurgation technique, one can extract a
zero-error PIR code from the random code. Outer bounds are also studied and
compared to establish the superiority of the non-linear codes over linear
codes.
