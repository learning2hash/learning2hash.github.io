Recent advances in diffusion models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) have made text-to-image generation and customization widely accessible,
with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) able to replicate an artist's style or subject
using minimal data and computation. In this paper, we examine the relationship
between LoRA weights and artistic styles, demonstrating that LoRA weights alone
can serve as an effective descriptor of style, without the need for additional
image generation or knowledge of the original training set. Our findings show
that LoRA weights yield better performance in clustering of artistic styles
compared to traditional pre-trained features, such as CLIP and DINO, with
strong structural similarities between LoRA-based and conventional image-based
embeddings observed both qualitatively and quantitatively. We identify various
retrieval scenarios for the growing collection of customized models and show
that our approach enables more accurate retrieval in real-world settings where
knowledge of the training images is unavailable and additional generation is
required. We conclude with a discussion on potential future applications, such
as zero-shot LoRA fine-tuning and model attribution.
