The advent of social media platforms has been a catalyst for the development
of digital photography that engendered a boom in vision applications. With this
motivation, we introduce a large-scale dataset termed 'Photozilla', which
includes over 990k images belonging to 10 different photographic styles. The
dataset is then used to train 3 classification models to automatically classify
the images into the relevant style which resulted in an accuracy of ~96%. With
the rapid evolution of digital photography, we have seen new types of
photography styles emerging at an exponential rate. On that account, we present
a novel Siamese-based network that uses the trained classification models as
the base architecture to adapt and classify unseen styles with only 25 training
samples. We report an accuracy of over 68% for identifying 10 other distinct
types of photography styles. This dataset can be found at
