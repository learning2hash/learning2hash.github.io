Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems have been widely used for a wide
range of applications such as Art collections, Crime prevention and
Intellectual property. In this paper, a novel CBIR system, which utilizes
visual contents (color, texture and shape) of an image to retrieve images, is
proposed. The proposed system builds three feature vectors and stores them into
MySQL database. The first feature vector uses descriptive statistics to
describe the distribution of data in each channel of RGB channels of the image.
The second feature vector describes the texture using eigenvalues of the 39
sub-bands that are generated after applying four levels 2D DWT in each channel
(red, green and blue channels) of the image. These wavelets sub-bands perfectly
describes the horizontal, vertical and diagonal edges that exist in the
multi-resolution analysis of the image. The third feature vector describes the
basic shapes that exist in the skeletonization version of the black and white
representation of the image. Experimental results on a private MYSQL database
that consists of 10000 images, using color, texture, shape and stored relevance
feedbacks, showed 96.4% average correct retrieval rate in an efficient recovery
time.
