Machine translation has been a major motivation of development in natural
language processing. Despite the burgeoning achievements in creating more
efficient machine translation systems thanks to deep learning methods, parallel
corpora have remained indispensable for progress in the field. In an attempt to
create parallel corpora for the Kurdish language, in this paper, we describe
our approach in retrieving potentially-alignable news articles from
multi-language websites and manually align them across dialects and languages
based on lexical similarity and transliteration of scripts. We present a corpus
containing 12,327 translation pairs in the two major dialects of Kurdish,
Sorani and Kurmanji. We also provide 1,797 and 650 translation pairs in
English-Kurmanji and English-Sorani. The corpus is publicly available under the
CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
