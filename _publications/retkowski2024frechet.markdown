In this paper we introduce the Frechet Music Distance (FMD), a novel
evaluation metric for generative symbolic music models, inspired by the Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) in computer vision and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) in
generative audio. FMD calculates the distance between distributions of
reference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical
features. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate
that FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific
metric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a
reproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.
