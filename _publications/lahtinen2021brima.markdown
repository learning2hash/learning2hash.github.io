Image annotation and large annotated datasets are crucial parts within the
Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence fields.At the same time, it is
well-known and acknowledged by the research community that the image annotation
process is challenging, time-consuming and hard to scale. Therefore, the
researchers and practitioners are always seeking ways to perform the
annotations easier, faster, and at higher quality. Even though several widely
used tools exist and the tools' landscape evolved considerably, most of the
tools still require intricate technical setups and high levels of technical
savviness from its operators and crowdsource contributors.
  In order to address such challenges, we develop and present BRIMA -- a
flexible and open-source browser extension that allows BRowser-only IMage
Annotation at considerably lower overheads. Once added to the browser, it
instantly allows the user to annotate images easily and efficiently directly
from the browser without any installation or setup on the client-side. It also
features cross-browser and cross-platform functionality thus presenting itself
as a neat tool for researchers within the Computer Vision, Artificial
Intelligence, and privacy-related fields.
