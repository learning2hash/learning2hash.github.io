Unsupervised dictionary learning has been a key component in state-of-the-art
computer vision recognition architectures. While highly effective methods exist
for patch-based dictionary learning, these methods may learn redundant features
after the pooling stage in a given early vision architecture. In this paper, we
offer a novel dictionary learning scheme to efficiently take into account the
invariance of learned features after the spatial pooling stage. The algorithm
is built on simple clustering, and thus enjoys efficiency and scalability. We
discuss the underlying mechanism that justifies the use of clustering
algorithms, and empirically show that the algorithm finds better dictionaries
than patch-based methods with the same dictionary size.
