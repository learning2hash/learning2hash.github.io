We present four logic puzzles and after that their solutions. Joseph Yeo
designed 'Cheryl's Birthday'. Mike Hartley came up with a novel solution for
'One Hundred Prisoners and a Light Bulb'. Jonathan Welton designed 'A Blind
Guess' and 'Abby's Birthday'. Hans van Ditmarsch and Barteld Kooi authored the
puzzlebook 'One Hundred Prisoners and a Light Bulb' that contains other
knowledge puzzles, and that can also be found on the webpage
http://personal.us.es/hvd/lightbulb.html dedicated to the book.
