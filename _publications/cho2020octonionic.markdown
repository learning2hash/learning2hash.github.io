We define and study the windings along Brownian paths in the octonionic
Euclidean, projective and hyperbolic spaces which are isometric to
8-dimensional Riemannian model spaces. In particular, the asymptotic laws of
these windings are shown to be Gaussian for the flat and spherical geometries
while the hyperbolic winding exhibits a different long time-behavior.
