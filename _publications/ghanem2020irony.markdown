This paper proposes the first multilingual (French, English and Arabic) and
multicultural (Indo-European languages vs. less culturally close languages)
irony detection system. We employ both feature-based models and neural
architectures using monolingual word representation. We compare the performance
of these systems with state-of-the-art systems to identify their capabilities.
We show that these monolingual models trained separately on different languages
using multilingual word representation or text-based features can open the door
to irony detection in languages that lack of annotated data for irony.
