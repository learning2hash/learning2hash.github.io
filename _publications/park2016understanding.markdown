Musicologists and sociologists have long been interested in patterns of music
consumption and their relation to socioeconomic status. In particular, the
Omnivore Thesis examines the relationship between these variables and the
diversity of music a person consumes. Using data from social media users of
Last.fm and Twitter, we design and evaluate a measure that reasonably captures
diversity of musical tastes. We use that measure to explore associations
between musical diversity and variables that capture socioeconomic status,
demographics, and personal traits such as openness and degree of interest in
music (into-ness). Our musical diversity measure can provide a useful means for
studies of musical preferences and consumption. Also, our study of the Omnivore
Thesis provides insights that extend previous survey and interview-based
studies.
