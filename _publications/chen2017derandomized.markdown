In this paper, we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families in the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-choice schemes when allocating sequentially \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} balls into \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} bins. We consider the \emph\{Uniform-Greedy\} scheme, which provides \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the least load, and its non-uniform variant --- the \emph\{Always-Go-Left\} scheme introduced by V\ocking. We construct a hash family with \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(\log n \log \log n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} random bits based on the previous work of Celis et al. and show the following results. 1. With high probability, this hash family has a maximum load of $\frac\{\log \log n\}\{\log d\} + O(1)$ in the \emph\{Uniform-Greedy\} scheme. 2. With high probability, it has a maximum load of $\frac\{\log \log n\}\{d \log \phi\_d\} + O(1)$ in the \emph\{Always-Go-Left\} scheme for a constant \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\phi\_d>1.61\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The maximum loads of our hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in the \emph\{Uniform-Greedy\} and \emph\{Always-Go-Left\} scheme separately, up to the low order term of constants. Previously, the best known hash families matching the same maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-choice schemes were \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(\log n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-wise independent functions, which needs \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\Theta(\log^2 n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} random bits.
