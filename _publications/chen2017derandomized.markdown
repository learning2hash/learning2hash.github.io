In this paper we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families in the d-choice schemes when allocating sequentially n balls into n bins. We consider the scheme which provides d independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the least load and its non-uniform variant --- the scheme introduced by V\ocking. We construct a hash family with O(\log n \log \log n) random bits based on the previous work of Celis et al. and show the following results. 1. With high probability this hash family has a maximum load of \log d + O(1) in the scheme. 2. With high probability it has a maximum load of d \log \phi_d + O(1) in the scheme for a constant \phi_d1.61. The maximum loads of our hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in the and scheme separately up to the low order term of constants. Previously the best known hash families matching the same maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in d-choice schemes were O(\log n)-wise independent functions which needs \Theta(\log^2 n) random bits.
