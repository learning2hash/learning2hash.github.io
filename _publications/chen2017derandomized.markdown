In this paper we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families in the (d)-choice schemes when allocating sequentially (n) balls into (n) bins. We consider the emphUniform-Greedy scheme which provides (d) independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the least load and its non-uniform variant --- the emphAlways-Go-Left scheme introduced by Vocking. We construct a hash family with (O(log n log log n)) random bits based on the previous work of Celis et al. and show the following results. 1. With high probability this hash family has a maximum load of fraclog log nlog d + O(1) in the emphUniform-Greedy scheme. 2. With high probability it has a maximum load of fraclog log nd log phi_d + O(1) in the emphAlways-Go-Left scheme for a constant (phi_d1.61). The maximum loads of our hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in the emphUniform-Greedy and emphAlways-Go-Left scheme separately up to the low order term of constants. Previously the best known hash families matching the same maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in (d)-choice schemes were (O(log n))-wise independent functions which needs (Theta(log^2 n)) random bits.
