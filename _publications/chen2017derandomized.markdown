<p>In this paper, we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families
in the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-choice schemes when
allocating sequentially <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls
into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins. We consider the
scheme, which provides <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the
least load, and its non-uniform variant — the scheme introduced by
V"ocking. We construct a hash family with <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log n \log \log n)\)</span> random bits based
on the previous work of Celis et al. and show the following results. 1.
With high probability, this hash family has a maximum load of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\log
\log n}{\log d} + O(1)\)</span> in the scheme. 2. With high probability,
it has a maximum load of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\log \log
n}{d \log
\phi_d} + O(1)\)</span> in the scheme for a constant <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_d&gt;1.61\)</span>. The maximum loads of our
hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function
in the and scheme separately, up to the low order term of constants.
Previously, the best known hash families matching the same maximum loads
of a perfectly random hash function in <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-choice schemes were <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span>-wise independent functions,
which needs <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(\log^2 n)\)</span> random
bits.</p>
