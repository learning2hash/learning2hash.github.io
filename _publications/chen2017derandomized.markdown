In this paper, we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families in the \(d\)-choice schemes when allocating sequentially \(n\) balls into \(n\) bins. We consider the \emph&amp;\#123;Uniform-Greedy&amp;\#125; scheme, which provides \(d\) independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the least load, and its non-uniform variant --- the \emph&amp;\#123;Always-Go-Left&amp;\#125; scheme introduced by V\ocking. We construct a hash family with \(O(\log n \log \log n)\) random bits based on the previous work of Celis et al. and show the following results. 1. With high probability, this hash family has a maximum load of $\frac&amp;\#123;\log \log n&amp;\#125;&amp;\#123;\log d&amp;\#125; + O(1)$ in the \emph&amp;\#123;Uniform-Greedy&amp;\#125; scheme. 2. With high probability, it has a maximum load of $\frac&amp;\#123;\log \log n&amp;\#125;&amp;\#123;d \log \phi\_d&amp;\#125; + O(1)$ in the \emph&amp;\#123;Always-Go-Left&amp;\#125; scheme for a constant \(\phi\_d>1.61\). The maximum loads of our hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in the \emph&amp;\#123;Uniform-Greedy&amp;\#125; and \emph&amp;\#123;Always-Go-Left&amp;\#125; scheme separately, up to the low order term of constants. Previously, the best known hash families matching the same maximum loads of a perfectly random hash function in \(d\)-choice schemes were \(O(\log n)\)-wise independent functions, which needs \(\Theta(\log^2 n)\) random bits.
