The internet is filled with fake face images and videos synthesized by deep
generative models. These realistic DeepFakes pose a challenge to determine the
authenticity of multimedia content. As countermeasures, artifact-based
detection methods suffer from insufficiently fine-grained features that lead to
limited detection performance. DNN-based detection methods are not efficient
enough, given that a DeepFake can be created easily by mobile apps and
DNN-based models require high computational resources. For the first time, we
show that DeepFake faces have fewer feature points than real ones, especially
in certain facial regions. Inspired by feature point detector-descriptors to
extract discriminative features at the pixel level, we propose the Fused Facial
Region_Feature Descriptor (FFR_FD) for effective and fast DeepFake detection.
FFR_FD is only a vector extracted from the face, and it can be constructed from
any feature point detector-descriptors. We train a random forest classifier
with FFR_FD and conduct extensive experiments on six large-scale DeepFake
datasets, whose results demonstrate that our method is superior to most state
of the art DNN-based models.
