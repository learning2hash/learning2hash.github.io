With the growth of online shopping for fashion products, accurate fashion
recommendation has become a critical problem. Meanwhile, social networks
provide an open and new data source for personalized fashion analysis. In this
work, we study the problem of personalized fashion recommendation from social
media data, i.e. recommending new outfits to social media users that fit their
fashion preferences. To this end, we present an item-to-set metric learning
framework that learns to compute the similarity between a set of historical
fashion items of a user to a new fashion item. To extract features from
multi-modal street-view fashion items, we propose an embedding module that
performs multi-modality feature extraction and cross-modality gated fusion. To
validate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a real-world social
media dataset. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset show the superior
performance of our proposed approach.
