Hashing has been widely used for large45;scale search due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. By using supervised information supervised hashing can significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently discrete supervised hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in supervised hashing. On one hand hashing is essentially a discrete optimization problem. Hence utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete (binary) coding procedure can avoid sub45;optimal solution and improve the accuracy. On the other hand deep hashing which integrates deep feature learning and hash45;code learning into an end45;to45;end architecture can enhance the feedback between feature learning and hash45;code learning. The key in discrete supervised hashing is to adopt supervised information to directly guide the discrete coding procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to adopt the supervised information to directly guide the deep feature learning procedure. However there have not existed works which can use the supervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure in the same framework. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH) to address this problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize supervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure and thus enhance the feedback between these two important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can outperform other state45;of45;the45;art baselines including both discrete hashing and deep hashing baselines for image retrieval.
