Hashing has been widely used for large-scale search due to its low storage cost
and fast query speed. By using supervised information, supervised hashing can
significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently, discrete supervised
hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in supervised
hashing. On one hand, hashing is essentially a discrete optimization problem.
Hence, utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete (binary)
coding procedure can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the accuracy. On the
other hand, deep hashing, which integrates deep feature learning and hash-code
learning into an end-to-end architecture, can enhance the feedback between
feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in discrete supervised hashing
is to adopt supervised information to directly guide the discrete coding
procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to adopt the supervised
information to directly guide the deep feature learning procedure. However,
there have not existed works which can use the supervised information to
directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning
procedure in the same framework. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing
method, called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH), to address this problem.
DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize supervised information
to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning
procedure, and thus enhance the feedback between these two important procedures.
Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can outperform other state-of-
the-art baselines, including both discrete hashing and deep hashing baselines,
for image retrieval.
