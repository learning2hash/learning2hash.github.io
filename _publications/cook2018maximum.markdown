Let \\(P_N\\) be a uniform random \\(N\times N\\) permutation matrix and let
\\(\chi_N(z)=\det(zI_N- P_N)\\) denote its characteristic polynomial. We prove a
law of large numbers for the maximum modulus of \\(\chi_N\\) on the unit circle,
specifically, \[ \sup_\{|z|=1\}|\chi_N(z)|= N^\{x_0 + o(1)\} \] with probability
tending to one as \\(N\to \infty\\), for a numerical constant \\(x_0\approx 0.652\\).
The main idea of the proof is to uncover a logarithmic correlation structure
for the distribution of (the logarithm of) \\(\chi_N\\), viewed as a random field
on the circle, and to adapt a well-known second moment argument for the maximum
of the branching random walk. Unlike the well-studied *CUE field* in which
\\(P_N\\) is replaced with a Haar unitary, the distribution of \\(\chi_N(e^\{2\pi
it\})\\) is sensitive to Diophantine properties of the point \\(t\\). To deal with
this we borrow tools from the Hardy--Littlewood circle method in analytic
number theory.
