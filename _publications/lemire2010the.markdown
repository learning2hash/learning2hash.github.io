Iterated hash functions process strings recursively, one character at a time. At
each iteration, they compute a new hash value from the preceding hash value and
the next character. We prove that iterated hashing can be pairwise independent,
but never 3-wise independent. We show that it can be almost universal over
strings much longer than the number of hash values; we bound the maximal string
length given the collision probability.
