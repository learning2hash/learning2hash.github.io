A complete pipeline is presented for accurate and efficient partial 3D object
retrieval based on Quick Intersection Count Change Image (QUICCI) binary local
descriptors and a novel indexing tree. It is shown how a modification to the
QUICCI query descriptor makes it ideal for partial retrieval. An indexing
structure called Dissimilarity Tree is proposed which can significantly
accelerate searching the large space of local descriptors; this is applicable
to QUICCI and other binary descriptors. The index exploits the distribution of
bits within descriptors for efficient retrieval. The retrieval pipeline is
tested on the artificial part of SHREC'16 dataset with near-ideal retrieval
results.
