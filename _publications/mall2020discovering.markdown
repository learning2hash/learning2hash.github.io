The fashion sense -- meaning the clothing styles people wear -- in a
geographical region can reveal information about that region. For example, it
can reflect the kind of activities people do there, or the type of crowds that
frequently visit the region (e.g., tourist hot spot, student neighborhood,
business center). We propose a method to automatically create underground
neighborhood maps of cities by analyzing how people dress. Using publicly
available images from across a city, our method finds neighborhoods with a
similar fashion sense and segments the map without supervision. For 37 cities
worldwide, we show promising results in creating good underground maps, as
evaluated using experiments with human judges and underground map benchmarks
derived from non-image data. Our approach further allows detecting distinct
neighborhoods (what is the most unique region of LA?) and answering analogy
questions between cities (what is the "Downtown LA" of Bogota?).
