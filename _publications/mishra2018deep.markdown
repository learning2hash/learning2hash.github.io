In this paper, we address the problem of hand-drawn sketch recognition.
Inspired by the Bayesian decision theory, we present a deep metric learning
loss with the objective to minimize the Bayesian risk of misclassification. We
estimate this risk for every mini-batch during training, and learn robust deep
embeddings by backpropagating it to a deep neural network in an end-to-end
trainable paradigm. Our learnt embeddings are discriminative and robust despite
of intra-class variations and inter-class similarities naturally present in
hand-drawn sketch images. Outperforming the state of the art on sketch
recognition, our method achieves 82.2% and 88.7% on TU-Berlin-250 and
TU-Berlin-160 benchmarks respectively.
