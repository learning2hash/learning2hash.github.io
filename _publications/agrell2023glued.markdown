40 years ago, Conway and Sloane proposed using the highly symmetrical Coxeter-Todd lattice \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(K\_\{12\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for quantization, and estimated its second moment. Since then, all published lists identify \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(K\_\{12\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} as the best 12-dimensional lattice quantizer. Surprisingly, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(K\_\{12\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is not optimal: we construct two new 12-dimensional lattices with lower normalized second moments. The new lattices are obtained by gluing together 6-dimensional lattices.
