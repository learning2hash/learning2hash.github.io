<p>40 years ago, Conway and Sloane proposed using the highly symmetrical
Coxeter-Todd lattice <span class="math inline">\(K_{12}\)</span> for
quantization, and estimated its second moment. Since then, all published
lists identify <span class="math inline">\(K_{12}\)</span> as the best
12-dimensional lattice quantizer. Surprisingly, <span
class="math inline">\(K_{12}\)</span> is not optimal: we construct two
new 12-dimensional lattices with lower normalized second moments. The
new lattices are obtained by gluing together 6-dimensional lattices.</p>
