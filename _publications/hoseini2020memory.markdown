Minimax distance measure extracts the underlying patterns and manifolds in an
unsupervised manner. The existing methods require a quadratic memory with
respect to the number of objects. In this paper, we investigate efficient
sampling schemes in order to reduce the memory requirement and provide a linear
space complexity. In particular, we propose a novel sampling technique that
adapts well with Minimax distances. We evaluate the methods on real-world
datasets from different domains and analyze the results.
