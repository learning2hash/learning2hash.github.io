We consider the allocation problem in which \(m \leq (1-\epsilon) dn \) items
are to be allocated to \(n\) bins with capacity \(d\). The items
\(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m\) arrive sequentially and when item \(x_i\) arrives it is
given two possible bin locations \(p_i=h_1(x_i),q_i=h_2(x_i)\) via hash functions
\(h_1,h_2\). We consider a random walk procedure for inserting items and show
that the expected time insertion time is constant provided \(\epsilon =
Î©\left(\sqrt\{ \frac\{ log d\}\{d\}\} \right).\)
