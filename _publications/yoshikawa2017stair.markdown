In recent years, automatic generation of image descriptions (captions), that
is, image captioning, has attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper,
we particularly consider generating Japanese captions for images. Since most
available caption datasets have been constructed for English language, there
are few datasets for Japanese. To tackle this problem, we construct a
large-scale Japanese image caption dataset based on images from MS-COCO, which
is called STAIR Captions. STAIR Captions consists of 820,310 Japanese captions
for 164,062 images. In the experiment, we show that a neural network trained
using STAIR Captions can generate more natural and better Japanese captions,
compared to those generated using English-Japanese machine translation after
generating English captions.
