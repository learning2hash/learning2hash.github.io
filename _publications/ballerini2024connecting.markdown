Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a standard framework for
representing 3D scenes and objects, introducing a novel data type for
information exchange and storage. Concurrently, significant progress has been
made in multimodal representation learning for text and image data. This paper
explores a novel research direction that aims to connect the NeRF modality with
other modalities, similar to established methodologies for images and text. To
this end, we propose a simple framework that exploits pre-trained models for
NeRF representations alongside multimodal models for text and image processing.
Our framework learns a bidirectional mapping between NeRF embeddings and those
obtained from corresponding images and text. This mapping unlocks several novel
and useful applications, including NeRF zero-shot classification and NeRF
retrieval from images or text.
