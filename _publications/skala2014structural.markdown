The IDSgrep structural query system for Han character dictionaries is
presented. This system includes a data model and syntax for describing the
spatial structure of Han characters using Extended Ideographic Description
Sequences (EIDSes) based on the Unicode IDS syntax; a language for querying
EIDS databases, designed to suit the needs of font developers and foreign
language learners; a bit vector index inspired by Bloom filters for faster
query operations; a freely available implementation; and format translation
from popular third-party IDS and XML character databases. Experimental results
are included, with a comparison to other software used for similar
applications.
