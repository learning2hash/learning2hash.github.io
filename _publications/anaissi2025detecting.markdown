Memes are widely used for humor and cultural commentary, but they are
increasingly exploited to spread hateful content. Due to their multimodal
nature, hateful memes often evade traditional text-only or image-only detection
systems, particularly when they employ subtle or coded references. To address
these challenges, we propose a multimodal hate detection framework that
integrates key components: OCR to extract embedded text, captioning to describe
visual content neutrally, sub-label classification for granular categorization
of hateful content, RAG for contextually relevant retrieval, and VQA for
iterative analysis of symbolic and contextual cues. This enables the framework
to uncover latent signals that simpler pipelines fail to detect. Experimental
results on the Facebook Hateful Memes dataset reveal that the proposed
framework exceeds the performance of unimodal and conventional multimodal
models in both accuracy and AUC-ROC.
