A multi-access network consisting of \(N\) files, \(C\) caches, \(K\) users with
each user having access to a unique set of \(r\) caches has been introduced
recently by Muralidhar et al. ("Maddah-Ali-Niesen Scheme for Multi-access Coded
Caching," in \textit\{Proc. ITW\}, 2021). It considers Single File Retrieval
(SFR) i.e, each user demands an arbitrary file from the server. It proposes a
coded caching scheme which was shown to be optimal under the assumption of
uncoded placement by Brunero and Elia ("Fundamental Limits of Combinatorial
Multi-Access Caching" in \{\textit\{arXiv:2110.07426\} \}). The above multi-access
network is referred to as combinatorial topology which is considered in this
work with three additional features : a) Linear Function Retrieval (LFR) i.e.,
each user is interested in retrieving an arbitrary linear combination of files
in the server's library; b) Security i.e., the content of the library must be
kept secure from an eavesdropper who obtains the signal sent by the server; c)
Privacy i.e., each user can only get its required file and can not get any
information about the demands of other users. Achievable Secure, Private LFR
(SP-LFR) scheme, Secure LFR (S-LFR) scheme and Improved S-LFR scheme are
proposed. As special cases, our work recovers some of the results by Yan and
Tuninetti ("Key Superposition Simultaneously Achieves Security and Privacy in
Cache-Aided Linear Function Retrieval," in \textit\{Trans. Inf. Forensics and
Security\}, 2021") and Sengupta et al.("Fundamental limits of caching with
secure delivery," in \textit\{Trans. Inf. Forensics and Security\}, 2015). At a
memory point, \(M=\frac\{r\binom\{C\}\{r\}\}\{C\}\), the SP-LFR scheme is within a
constant multiplicative factor from the optimal rate for \(N\geq2Kr\) and at,
\(M=\frac\{\binom\{C\}\{r\}\}\{C\}\), the improved S-LFR scheme is within a constant
multiplicative factor from the optimal rate for \(N\geq2K\).
