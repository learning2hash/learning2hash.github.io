Scikit-network is a Python package inspired by scikit-learn for the analysis
of large graphs. Graphs are represented by their adjacency matrix in the sparse
CSR format of SciPy. The package provides state-of-the-art algorithms for
ranking, clustering, classifying, embedding and visualizing the nodes of a
graph. High performance is achieved through a mix of fast matrix-vector
products (using SciPy), compiled code (using Cython) and parallel processing.
The package is distributed under the BSD license, with dependencies limited to
NumPy and SciPy. It is compatible with Python 3.6 and newer. Source code,
documentation and installation instructions are available online.
