Recently, simplicial complexes are used in constructions of several infinite
families of minimal and optimal linear codes by Hyun \{\em et al.\} Building upon
their research, in this paper more linear codes over the ring \(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)
are constructed by simplicial complexes. Specifically, the Lee weight
distributions of the resulting quaternary codes are determined and two infinite
families of four-Lee-weight quaternary codes are obtained. Compared to the
databases of \(\mathbb Z_4\) codes by Aydin \{\em et al.\}, at least nine new
quaternary codes are found. Thanks to the special structure of the defining
sets, we have the ability to determine whether the Gray images of certain
obtained quaternary codes are linear or not. This allows us to obtain two
infinite families of binary nonlinear codes and one infinite family of binary
minimal linear codes. Furthermore, utilizing these minimal binary codes, some
secret sharing schemes as a byproduct also are established.
