In recent years deep45;networks45;based hashing has become a leading approach for large45;scale image retrieval. Most deep hashing approaches use the high layer to extract the powerful semantic representations. However these methods have limited ability for fine45;grained image retrieval because the semantic features extracted from the high layer are difficult in capturing the subtle differences. To this end we propose a novel two45;pyramid hashing architecture to learn both the semantic information and the subtle appearance details for fine45;grained image search. Inspired by the feature pyramids of convolutional neural network a vertical pyramid is proposed to capture the high45;layer features and a horizontal pyramid combines multiple low45;layer features with structural information to capture the subtle differences. To fuse the low45;level features a novel combination strategy called consensus fusion is proposed to capture all subtle information from several low45;layers for finer retrieval. Extensive evaluation on two fine45;grained datasets CUB45;20045;2011 and Stanford Dogs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the state45;of45;art baselines.
