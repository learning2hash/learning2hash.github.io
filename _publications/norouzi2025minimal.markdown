We propose a method for learning similaritypreserving
hash functions that map highdimensional
data onto binary codes. The
formulation is based on structured prediction
with latent variables and a hinge-like
loss function. It is efficient to train for large
datasets, scales well to large code lengths,
and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
