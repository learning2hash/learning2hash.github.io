In recent years, the amount of data available on the internet and the number
of users who utilize the Internet have increased at an unparalleled pace. The
exponential development in the quantity of digital information accessible and
the number of Internet users has created the possibility for information
overload, impeding fast access to items of interest on the Internet.
Information retrieval systems like as Google, DevilFinder, and Altavista have
partly overcome this challenge, but prioritizing and customization of
information (where a system maps accessible material to a user's interests and
preferences) were lacking. This has resulted in a higher-than-ever need for
recommender systems. Recommender systems are information filtering systems that
address the issue of information overload by filtering important information
fragments from a huge volume of dynamically produced data based on the user's
interests, favorite things, preferences and ratings on the desired item.
Recommender systems can figure out if a person would like an item or not based
on their profile.
