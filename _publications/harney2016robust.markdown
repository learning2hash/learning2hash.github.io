\\(H_q(n,d)\\) is defined as the graph with vertex set \\(\{\mathbb Z\}_q^n\\) and
where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at least \\(d\\). The
chromatic number of these graphs is presented for various sets of parameters
\\((q,n,d)\\). For the \\(4\\)-colorings of the graphs \\(H_2(n,n-1)\\) a notion of
robustness is introduced. It is based on the tolerance of swapping colors along
an edge without destroying properness of the coloring. An explicit description
of the maximally robust \\(4\\)-colorings of \\(H_2(n,n-1)\\) is presented.
