Shadows are common aspect of images and when left undetected can hinder scene
understanding and visual processing. We propose a simple yet effective approach
based on reflectance to detect shadows from single image. An image is first
segmented and based on the reflectance, illumination and texture
characteristics, segments pairs are identified as shadow and non-shadow pairs.
The proposed method is tested on two publicly available and widely used
datasets. Our method achieves higher accuracy in detecting shadows compared to
previous reported methods despite requiring fewer parameters. We also show
results of shadow-free images by relighting the pixels in the detected shadow
regions.
