With the rapid growth of multimedia data (e.g. image audio and video etc.) on the web learning45;based hashing techniques such as Deep Supervised Hashing (DSH) have proven to be very efficient for large45;scale multimedia search. The recent successes seen in Learning45;based hashing methods are largely due to the success of deep learning45;based hashing methods. However there are some limitations to previous learning45;based hashing methods (e.g. the learned hash codes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper we propose a novel learning45;based hashing method named Deep Attention45;guided Hashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea is to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the first stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of the hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing network). Specifically in the first network it leverages an attention network and hashing network to generate the attention45;guided hash codes from the original images. The loss function we propose contains two components the semantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the attention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the second network these attention45;guided hash codes are used to guide the training of the second hashing network (i.e. these codes are treated as supervised labels to train the second network). By doing this DAgH can make full use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the second hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true end45;to45;end fashion. Results from our experiments demonstrate that DAgH can generate high quality hash codes and it outperforms current state45;of45;the45;art methods on three benchmark datasets CIFAR45;10 NUS45;WIDE and ImageNet.
