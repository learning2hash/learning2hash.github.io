Locally repairable codes (LRC) have recently been a subject of intense
research due to theoretical appeal and their application in distributed storage
systems. In an LRC, any coordinate of a codeword can be recovered by accessing
only few other coordinates. For LRCs over small alphabet (such as binary), the
optimal rate-distance trade-off is unknown. In this paper we provide the
tightest known upper bound on the rate of linear LRCs of a given relative
distance, an improvement over any previous result, in particular
\cite\{cadambe2013upper\}.
