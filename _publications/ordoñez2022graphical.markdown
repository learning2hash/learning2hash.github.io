A binary \([n,k]\)-linear code \(\mathcal\{C\}\) is a \(k\)-dimensional subspace of
\(\mathbb\{F\}_2^n\). For \(\boldsymbol\{x\}\in \mathbb\{F\}_2^n\), the set
\(\boldsymbol\{x\}+\mathcal\{C\}\) is a coset of \(\mathcal\{C\}\). In this work we study
a partial ordering on the set of cosets of a binary linear code \(\mathcal\{C\}\)
of length \(n\) and we construct a graph using the orphan structure of this code.
