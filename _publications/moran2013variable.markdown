We introduce a scheme for optimally allocating
a variable number of bits per
LSH hyperplane. Previous approaches assign
a constant number of bits per hyperplane.
This neglects the fact that a subset
of hyperplanes may be more informative
than others. Our method, dubbed Variable
Bit Quantisation (VBQ), provides a datadriven
non-uniform bit allocation across
hyperplanes. Despite only using a fraction
of the available hyperplanes, VBQ outperforms
uniform quantisation by up to 168%
for retrieval across standard text and image
datasets.
