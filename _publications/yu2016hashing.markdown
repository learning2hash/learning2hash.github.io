Hashing has emerged as a popular technique for large45;scale similarity search. Most learning45;based hashing methods generate compact yet correlated hash codes. However this redundancy is storage45;inefficient. Hence we propose a lossless variable45;length hashing (VLH) method that is both storage45; and search45;efficient. Storage efficiency is achieved by converting the fixed45;length hash code into a variable45;length code. Search efficiency is obtained by using a multiple hash table structure. With VLH we are able to deliberately add redundancy into hash codes to improve retrieval performance with little sacrifice in storage efficiency or search complexity. In particular we propose a block K45;means hashing (B45;KMH) method to obtain significantly improved retrieval performance with no increase in storage and marginal increase in computational cost.
