Many previous methods have showed the importance of considering semantically
relevant objects for performing event recognition, yet none of the methods have
exploited the power of deep convolutional neural networks to directly integrate
relevant object information into a unified network. We present a novel unified
deep CNN architecture which integrates architecturally different, yet
semantically-related object detection networks to enhance the performance of
the event recognition task. Our architecture allows the sharing of the
convolutional layers and a fully connected layer which effectively integrates
event recognition, rigid object detection and non-rigid object detection.
