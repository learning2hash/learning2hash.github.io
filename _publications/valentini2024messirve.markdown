Information retrieval (IR) is the task of finding relevant documents in
response to a user query. Although Spanish is the second most spoken native
language, current IR benchmarks lack Spanish data, hindering the development of
information access tools for Spanish speakers. We introduce MessIRve, a
large-scale Spanish IR dataset with around 730 thousand queries from Google's
autocomplete API and relevant documents sourced from Wikipedia. MessIRve's
queries reflect diverse Spanish-speaking regions, unlike other datasets that
are translated from English or do not consider dialectal variations. The large
size of the dataset allows it to cover a wide variety of topics, unlike smaller
datasets. We provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, comparisons
with existing datasets, and baseline evaluations of prominent IR models. Our
contributions aim to advance Spanish IR research and improve information access
for Spanish speakers.
