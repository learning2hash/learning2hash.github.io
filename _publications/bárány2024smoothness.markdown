In this paper, we study the smoothness of the density function of absolutely continuous measures supported on random self-similar sets on the line. We show that the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater than 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\"older continuous density almost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1 then the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost surely.
