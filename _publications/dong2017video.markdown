Recently with the enormous growth of online videos fast video retrieval research has received increasing attention. As an extension of image hashing techniques traditional video hashing methods mainly depend on hand45;crafted features and transform the real45;valued features into binary hash codes. As videos provide far more diverse and complex visual information than images extracting features from videos is much more challenging than that from images. Therefore high45;level semantic features to represent videos are needed rather than low45;level hand45;crafted methods. In this paper a deep convolutional neural network is proposed to extract high45;level semantic features and a binary hash function is then integrated into this framework to achieve an end45;to45;end optimization. Particularly our approach also combines triplet loss function which preserves the relative similarity and difference of videos and classification loss function as the optimization objective. Experiments have been performed on two public datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state45;of45;the45;art video retrieval methods.
