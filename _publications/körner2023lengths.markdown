We determine the minimum possible column multiplicity of even, doubly-, and
triply-even codes given their length. This refines a classification result for
the possible lengths of \(q^r\)-divisible codes over \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\). We also give
a few computational results for field sizes \(q>2\). Non-existence results of
divisible codes with restricted column multiplicities for a given length have
applications e.g. in Galois geometry and can be used for upper bounds on the
maximum cardinality of subspace codes.
