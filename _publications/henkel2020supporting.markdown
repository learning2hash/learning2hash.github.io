This article presents an efficient end-to-end method to perform
instance-level recognition employed to the task of labeling and ranking
landmark images. In a first step, we embed images in a high dimensional feature
space using convolutional neural networks trained with an additive angular
margin loss and classify images using visual similarity. We then efficiently
re-rank predictions and filter noise utilizing similarity to out-of-domain
images. Using this approach we achieved the 1st place in the 2020 edition of
the Google Landmark Recognition challenge.
