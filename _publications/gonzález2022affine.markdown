In this manuscript, we introduce a new class of linear codes, called affine
symplectic Grassmann codes, and determine their parameters, automorphism group,
minimum distance codewords, dual code and other key features. These linear
codes are defined from an affine part of a polar symplectic Grassmannian. They
combine polar symplectic Grassmann codes and affine Grassmann codes.
