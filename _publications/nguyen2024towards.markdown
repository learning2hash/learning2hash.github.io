Recently, vision-language pre-trained models have emerged in computational
pathology. Previous works generally focused on the alignment of image-text
pairs via the contrastive pre-training paradigm. Such pre-trained models have
been applied to pathology image classification in zero-shot learning or
transfer learning fashion. Herein, we hypothesize that the pre-trained
vision-language models can be utilized for quantitative histopathology image
analysis through a simple image-to-text retrieval. To this end, we propose a
Text-based Quantitative and Explainable histopathology image analysis, which we
call TQx. Given a set of histopathology images, we adopt a pre-trained
vision-language model to retrieve a word-of-interest pool. The retrieved words
are then used to quantify the histopathology images and generate understandable
feature embeddings due to the direct mapping to the text description. To
evaluate the proposed method, the text-based embeddings of four histopathology
image datasets are utilized to perform clustering and classification tasks. The
results demonstrate that TQx is able to quantify and analyze histopathology
images that are comparable to the prevalent visual models in computational
pathology.
