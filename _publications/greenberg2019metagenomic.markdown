The goal of metagenomics is to study the composition of microbial
communities, typically using high-throughput shotgun sequencing. In the
metagenomic binning problem, we observe random substrings (called contigs) from
a mixture of genomes and want to cluster them according to their genome of
origin. Based on the empirical observation that genomes of different bacterial
species can be distinguished based on their tetranucleotide frequencies, we
model this task as the problem of clustering N sequences generated by M
distinct Markov processes, where M<<N. Utilizing the large-deviation principle
for Markov processes, we establish the information-theoretic limit for perfect
binning. Specifically, we show that the length of the contigs must scale with
the inverse of the Chernoff Information between the two most similar species.
Our result also implies that contigs should be binned using the conditional
relative entropy as a measure of distance, as opposed to the Euclidean distance
often used in practice.
