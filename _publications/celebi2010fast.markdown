Color quantization is an important operation with numerous applications in
graphics and image processing. Most quantization methods are essentially based
on data clustering algorithms. However, despite its popularity as a general
purpose clustering algorithm, k-means has not received much respect in the
color quantization literature because of its high computational requirements
and sensitivity to initialization. In this paper, a fast color quantization
method based on k-means is presented. The method involves several modifications
to the conventional (batch) k-means algorithm including data reduction, sample
weighting, and the use of triangle inequality to speed up the nearest neighbor
search. Experiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that, with the
proposed modifications, k-means becomes very competitive with state-of-the-art
color quantization methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
