Color quantization is an important operation with numerous applications in graphics and image processing. Most quantization methods are essentially based on data clustering algorithms. However despite its popularity as a general purpose clustering algorithm k-means has not received much respect in the color quantization literature because of its high computational requirements and sensitivity to initialization. In this paper a fast color quantization method based on k-means is presented. The method involves several modifications to the conventional (batch) k-means algorithm including data reduction sample weighting and the use of triangle inequality to speed up the nearest neighbor search. Experiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that with the proposed modifications k-means becomes very competitive with state-of-the-art color quantization methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
