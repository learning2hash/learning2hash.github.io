A quantitative "fourth moment theorem" is provided for any self-adjoint
element in a homogeneous Wigner chaos: the Wasserstein distance is controlled
by the distance from the fourth moment to two. The proof uses the free
counterpart of the Stein discrepancy. On the way, the free analogue of the WSH
inequality is established.
