We demonstrate that large texts, representing human (English, Russian,
Ukrainian) and artificial (C++, Java) languages, display quantitative patterns
characterized by the Benford-like and Zipf laws. The frequency of a word
following the Zipf law is inversely proportional to its rank, whereas the total
numbers of a certain word appearing in the text generate the uneven
Benford-like distribution of leading numbers. Excluding the most popular words
essentially improves the correlation of actual textual data with the Zipfian
distribution, whereas the Benford distribution of leading numbers (arising from
the overall amount of a certain word) is insensitive to the same elimination
procedure. The calculated values of the moduli of slopes of double
logarithmical plots for artificial languages (C++, Java) are markedly larger
than those for human ones.
