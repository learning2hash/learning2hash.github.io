Our focus is on approximate nearest neighbor retrieval in metric and non45;metric spaces. We employ a VP45;tree and explore two simple yet effective learning45;to prune approaches density estimation through sampling and stretching of the triangle inequality. Both methods are evaluated using data sets with metric (Euclidean) and non45;metric (KL45;divergence and Itakura45;Saito) distance functions. Conditions on spaces where the VP45;tree is applicable are discussed. The VP45;tree with a learned pruner is compared against the recently proposed state45;of45;the45;art approaches the bbtree the multi45;probe locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and permutation methods. Our method was competitive against state45;of45;the45;art methods and in most cases was more efficient for the same rank approximation quality.
