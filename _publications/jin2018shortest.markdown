Color texture representation is an important step in the task of texture
classification. Shortest paths was used to extract color texture features from
RGB and HSV color spaces. In this paper, we propose to use shortest paths in
the HSI space to build a texture representation for classification. In
particular, two undirected graphs are used to model the H channel and the S and
I channels respectively in order to represent a color texture image. Moreover,
the shortest paths is constructed by using four pairs of pixels according to
different scales and directions of the texture image. Experimental results on
colored Brodatz and USPTex databases reveal that our proposed method is
effective, and the highest classification accuracy rate is 96.93% in the
Brodatz database.
