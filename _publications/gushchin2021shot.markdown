Shot boundary detection in video is one of the key stages of video data
processing. A new method for shot boundary detection based on several video
features, such as color histograms and object boundaries, has been proposed.
The developed algorithm was tested on the open BBC Planet Earth [1] and RAI [2]
datasets, and the MSU CC datasets, based on videos used in the video codec
comparison conducted at MSU, as well as videos from the IBM set, were also
plotted. The total dataset for algorithm development and testing exceeded the
known TRECVID datasets. Based on the test results, the proposed algorithm for
scene change detection outperformed its counterparts with a final F-score of
0.9794.
