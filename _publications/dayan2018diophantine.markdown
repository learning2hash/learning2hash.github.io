We show that fractal percolation sets in \(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\) almost surely
intersect every hyperplane absolutely winning (HAW) set with full Hausdorff
dimension. In particular, if \(E\subset\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\) is a realization of a
fractal percolation process, then almost surely (conditioned on
\(E\neq\emptyset\)), for every countable collection
\(\left(f_\{i\}\right)_\{i\in\mathbb\{N\}\}\) of \(C^\{1\}\) diffeomorphisms of
\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\),
\(\dim_\{H\}\left(E\cap\left(\bigcap_\{i\in\mathbb\{N\}\}f_\{i\}\left(\text\{BA\}_\{d\}\right)\right)\right)=\dim_\{H\}\left(E\right)\),
where \(\text\{BA\}_\{d\}\) is the set of badly approximable vectors in
\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\). We show this by proving that \(E\) almost surely contains
hyperplane diffuse subsets which are Ahlfors-regular with dimensions
arbitrarily close to \(\dim_\{H\}\left(E\right)\).
  We achieve this by analyzing Galton-Watson trees and showing that they almost
surely contain appropriate subtrees whose projections to \(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\) yield
the aforementioned subsets of \(E\). This method allows us to obtain a more
general result by projecting the Galton-Watson trees against any similarity IFS
whose attractor is not contained in a single affine hyperplane. Thus our
general result relates to a broader class of random fractals than fractal
percolation.
