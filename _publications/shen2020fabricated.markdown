Fabricating experimental pictures in research work is a serious academic
misconduct, which should better be detected in the reviewing process. However,
due to large number of submissions, the detection whether a picture is
fabricated or reused is laborious for reviewers, and sometimes is indistinct
with human eyes. A tool for detecting similarity between images may help to
alleviate this problem. Some methods based on local feature points matching
work for most of the time, while these methods may result in mess of matchings
due to ignorance of global relationship between features. We present a
framework to detect similar, or perhaps fabricated, pictures with the graph
matching techniques. A new iterative method is proposed, and experiments show
that such a graph matching technique is better than the methods based only on
local features for some cases.
