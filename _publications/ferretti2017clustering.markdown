Musical pieces can be modeled as complex networks. This fosters innovative
ways to categorize music, paving the way towards novel applications in
multimedia domains, such as music didactics, multimedia entertainment and
digital music generation. Clustering these networks through their main metrics
allows grouping similar musical tracks. To show the viability of the approach,
we provide results on a dataset of guitar solos.
