In this paper we study the bound on three kinds of hash family using the Singleton bound. To \epsilon-U(N; n m) hash family in the caes of nm^21 and 1\geq\epsilon\geq \epsilon_1(n m) we get that the new bound is better. To \epsilon-\bigtriangleup U(N; n m) hash family in the case of nm1 and 1\geq\epsilon\geq\epsilon_3(nm) the new bound is better. To \epsilon-SU(N; n m) hash family in the case of n2^m2 and 1\geq\epsilon\geq \epsilon_4(n m) we get that the new bound is better.
