We present a theory for Euclidean dimensionality reduction with subgaussian
matrices which unifies several restricted isometry property and
Johnson-Lindenstrauss type results obtained earlier for specific data sets. In
particular, we recover and, in several cases, improve results for sets of
sparse and structured sparse vectors, low-rank matrices and tensors, and smooth
manifolds. In addition, we establish a new Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding for
data sets taking the form of an infinite union of subspaces of a Hilbert space.
