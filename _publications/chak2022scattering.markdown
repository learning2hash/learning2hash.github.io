We propose to use the Generalized Morse Wavelets (GMWs) instead of
commonly-used Morlet (or Gabor) wavelets in the Scattering Transform Network
(STN), which we call the GMW-STN, for signal classification problems. The GMWs
form a parameterized family of truly analytic wavelets while the Morlet
wavelets are only approximately analytic. The analyticity of underlying wavelet
filters in the STN is particularly important for nonstationary oscillatory
signals such as music signals because it improves interpretability of the STN
representations by providing multiscale amplitude and phase (and consequently
frequency) information of input signals. We demonstrate the superiority of the
GMW-STN over the conventional STN in music genre classification using the
so-called GTZAN database. Moreover, we show the performance improvement of the
GMW-STN by increasing its number of layers to three over the typical two-layer
STN.\}
