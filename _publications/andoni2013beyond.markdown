We present a new data structure for the c45;approximate near neighbor problem (ANN) in the Euclidean space. For n points in R^d our algorithm achieves O(n^123;ρ125; + d log n) query time and O(n^123;1 + ρ125; + d log n) space where ρ <= 7/(8c^2) + O(1 / c^3) + o(1). This is the first improvement over the result by Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 2006) and the first data structure that bypasses a locality45;sensitive hashing lower bound proved by ODonnell Wu and Zhou (ICS 2011). By a standard reduction we obtain a data structure for the Hamming space and ell95;1 norm with ρ <= 7/(8c) + O(1/c^123;3/2125;) + o(1) which is the first improvement over the result of Indyk and Motwani (STOC 1998).
