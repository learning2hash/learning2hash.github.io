Image zooming is the process of enlarging the spatial resolution of a given
digital image. We present a novel technique that intelligently modifies the
classical pixel replication method for zooming. Our method decomposes a given
image into layer of binary images, interpolates them by magnifying the binary
patterns preserving their geometric shape and finally aggregates them all to
obtain the zoomed image. Although the quality of our zoomed images is much
higher than that of nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation and comparable
with bicubic interpolation, the running time of our technique is extremely fast
like nearest neighbor interpolation and much faster than bilinear and bicubic
interpolation.
