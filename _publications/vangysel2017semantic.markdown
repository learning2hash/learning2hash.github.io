Unsupervised learning of low-dimensional, semantic representations of words
and entities has recently gained attention. In this paper we describe the
Semantic Entity Retrieval Toolkit (SERT) that provides implementations of our
previously published entity representation models. The toolkit provides a
unified interface to different representation learning algorithms, fine-grained
parsing configuration and can be used transparently with GPUs. In addition,
users can easily modify existing models or implement their own models in the
framework. After model training, SERT can be used to rank entities according to
a textual query and extract the learned entity/word representation for use in
downstream algorithms, such as clustering or recommendation.
