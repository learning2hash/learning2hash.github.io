In order to prevent detection and evade signature-based scanning methods,
which are normally exploited by antivirus software, metamorphic viruses use
several various obfuscation approaches. They transform their code in new
instances as look entirely or partly different and contain dissimilar sequences
of string, but their behavior and function remain unchanged. This obfuscation
process allows them to stay away from the string based signature detection. In
this research, we use a statistical technique to compare the similarity between
two files infected by two morphed versions of a given metamorphic virus. Our
proposed solution based on static analysis and it uses the histogram of machine
instructions frequency in various offspring of obfuscated viruses. We use
Euclidean histogram distance metric to compare a pair of portable executable
(PE) files. The aim of this study is to show that for some particular
obfuscation methods, the presented solution can be exploited to detect morphed
varieties of a file. Hence, it can be utilized by non-string based signature
scanning to identify whether a file is a version of a metamorphic virus or not.
