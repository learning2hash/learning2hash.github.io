The digital images from various sources are ubiquitous due to easy
availability of high bandwidth Internet. Digital images are easy to tamper with
good or bad intentions. Non-availability of pre-embedded information in digital
images makes the tampering detection process more difficult in case of digital
forensics. Thus, passive image tampering is difficult to detect. There are
various algorithms available for detecting image tampering. However, these
algorithms have some drawbacks, due to which all types of tampering cannot be
detected. In this paper researchers intend to present the types of image
tampering and its detection techniques with example based approach. This paper
also illustrates insights into the various existing algorithms and tries to
find out efficient algorithm out of them.
