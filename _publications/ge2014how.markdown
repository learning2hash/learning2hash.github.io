Developers spend a significant amount of time searching their local codebase.
To help them search efficiently, researchers have proposed novel tools that
apply state-of-the-art information retrieval algorithms to retrieve relevant
code snippets from the local codebase. However, these tools still rely on the
developer to craft an effective query, which requires that the developer is
familiar with the terms contained in the related code snippets. Our empirical
data from a state-of-the-art local code search tool, called Sando, suggests
that developers are sometimes unacquainted with their local codebase. In order
to bridge the gap between developers and their ever-increasing local codebase,
in this paper we demonstrate the recommendation techniques integrated in Sando.
