In typical coded caching scenarios, the content of a central library is
assumed to be of interest to all receiving users. However, in a realistic
scenario the users may have diverging interests which may intersect to various
degrees. What happens for example if each file is of potential interest to,
say, \(40\,%\) of the users and each user has potential interest in \(40\,%\) of
the library? What if then each user caches selfishly only from content of
potential interest? In this work, we formulate the symmetric selfish coded
caching problem, where each user naturally makes requests from a subset of the
library, which defines its own file demand set (FDS), and caches selfishly only
contents from its own FDS. For the scenario where the different FDSs
symmetrically overlap to some extent, we propose a novel information-theoretic
converse that reveals, for such general setting of symmetric FDS structures,
that selfish coded caching yields a load performance which is strictly worse
than that in standard coded caching.
