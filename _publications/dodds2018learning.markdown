In this paper, we propose learning an embedding function for content-based image
retrieval within the e-commerce domain using the triplet loss and an online
sampling method that constructs triplets from within a minibatch. We compare our
method to several strong baselines as well as recent works on the DeepFashion
and Stanford Online Product datasets. Our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art on the DeepFashion dataset. With a modification to favor
sampling minibatches from a single product category, the same approach
demonstrates competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art for the
Stanford Online Products dataset.
