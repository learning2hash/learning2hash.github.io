We consider the number of crossings in a graph which is embedded randomly on
a convex set of points. We give an estimate to the normal distribution in
Kolmogorov distance which implies a convergence rate of order \(n^\{-1/2\}\) for
various families of graphs, including random chord diagrams or full cycles.
