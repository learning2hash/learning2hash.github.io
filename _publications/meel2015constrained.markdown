Constrained sampling and counting are two fundamental problems in artificial
intelligence with a diverse range of applications, spanning probabilistic
reasoning and planning to constrained-random verification. While the theory of
these problems was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did
not scale to industrial size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to
achieve scalability. Recently, we proposed a novel approach that combines
universal hashing and SAT solving and scales to formulas with hundreds of
thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees. This paper
provides an overview of the key ingredients of the approach and discusses
challenges that need to be overcome to handle larger real-world instances.
