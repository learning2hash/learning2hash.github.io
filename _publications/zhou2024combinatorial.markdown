In the classical probability model, let \(f(n)\) be the maximum number of
pairwise independent events for the sample space with \(n\) sample points. The
determination of \(f(n)\) is equivalent to the problem of determining the maximum
cardinality of specific intersecting families on the set \(\\{1,2,\ldots,n\\}\) .
We show that \(f(n)\leq n+1\), and \(f(n)=n+1\) if there exists a Hadamard matrix
of order \(n\).
