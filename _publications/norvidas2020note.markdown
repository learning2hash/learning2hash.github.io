Let \(CH(R)\) denote the family of characteristic functions of probability
measures (distributions) on the real line \(R\). We study the following question:
given an integer \(n>1\), do there exist two different \(f, g\in CH(R)\) such that
\( f^n\equiv g^n\)? For positive even \(n\), well-known examples answer this
question in the affirmative. It turns out that the same is true also for any
odd \(n>1\). For \(f\in CH(R)\) and integer \(n>1\), set \(C_n(f)=\\{g\in CH(R):
g^n\equiv f^n\\}\). In this paper, we give an estimate for cardinality (or
cardinal number) of \(C_n(f)\). In addition, we describe such \(f\) for which our
estimate is sharp.
