With the advantage of low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency hashing techniques have recently been an emerging topic in cross45;modal similarity search. As multiple modal data reflect similar semantic content many researches aim at learning unified binary codes. However discriminative hashing features learned by these methods are not adequate. This results in lower accuracy and robustness. We propose a novel hashing learning framework which jointly performs classifier learning subspace learning and matrix factorization to preserve class45;specific semantic content termed Discriminative Supervised Hashing (DSH) to learn the discrimative unified binary codes for multi45;modal data. Besides reducing the loss of information and preserving the non45;linear structure of data DSH non45;linearly projects different modalities into the common space in which the similarity among heterogeneous data points can be measured. Extensive experiments conducted on the three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper outperforms several state45;of 45;the45;art methods.
