We consider a random permutation drawn from the set of 321-avoiding
permutations of length \\(n\\) and show that the number of occurrences of another
pattern \\(\sigma\\) has a limit distribution, after scaling by \\(n^\{m+\ell\}\\) where
\\(m\\) is the length of \\(\sigma\\) and \\(\ell\\) is the number of blocks in it. The
limit is not normal, and can be expressed as a functional of a Brownian
excursion.
