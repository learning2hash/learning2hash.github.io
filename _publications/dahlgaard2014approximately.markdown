A random hash function \(h\) is \(\varepsilon\)-minwise if for any set \(S\), \(|S|=n\), and element \(x\in S\), \(\Pr[h(x)=\min h(S)]=(1\pm\varepsilon)/n\). Minwise hash functions with low bias \(\varepsilon\) have widespread applications within similarity estimation. Hashing from a universe \([u]\), the twisted tabulation hashing of P\v\{a\}tra\c\{s\}cu and Thorup [SODA'13] makes \(c=O(1)\) lookups in tables of size \(u^\{1/c\}\). Twisted tabulation was invented to get good concentration for hashing based sampling. Here we show that twisted tabulation yields $\tilde O(1/u^\{1/c\})$-minwise hashing. In the classic independence paradigm of Wegman and Carter [FOCS'79] $\tilde O(1/u^\{1/c\})\(-minwise hashing requires \)\Omega(\log u)$-independence [Indyk SODA'99]. P\v\{a\}tra\c\{s\}cu and Thorup [STOC'11] had shown that simple tabulation, using same space and lookups yields \(\tilde O(1/n^\{1/c\})\)-minwise independence, which is good for large sets, but useless for small sets. Our analysis uses some of the same methods, but is much cleaner bypassing a complicated induction argument.
