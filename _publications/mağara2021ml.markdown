Preserving the privacy and security of big data in the context of cloud
computing, while maintaining a certain level of efficiency of its processing
remains to be a subject, open for improvement. One of the most popular
applications epitomizing said concerns is found to be useful in genome
analysis. This work proposes a secure multi-label tumor classification method
using homomorphic encryption, whereby two different machine learning
algorithms, SVM and XGBoost, are used to classify the encrypted genome data of
different tumor types.
