Lyrics parody swaps one set of words that accompany a melody with a new set
of words, preserving the number of syllables per line and the rhyme scheme.
Lyrics parody generation is a challenge for controllable text generation. We
show how a specialized sampling procedure, combined with backward text
generation with XLNet can produce parody lyrics that reliably meet the syllable
and rhyme scheme constraints.We introduce the Weird AI Yankovic system and
provide a case study evaluation. We conclude with societal implications of
neural lyric parody generation.
