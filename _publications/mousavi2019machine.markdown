Image collections, if critical aspects of image content are exposed, can spur
research and practical applications in many domains. Supervised machine
learning may be the only feasible way to annotate very large collections, but
leading approaches rely on large samples of completely and accurately annotated
images. In the case of a large forensic collection, we are aiming to annotate,
neither the complete annotation nor the large training samples can be feasibly
produced. We, therefore, investigate ways to assist manual annotation efforts
done by forensic experts. We present a method that can propose both images and
areas within an image likely to contain desired classes. Evaluation of the
method with human annotators showed highly accurate classification that was
strongly helped by transfer learning. The segmentation precision (mAP) was
improved by adding a separate class capturing background, but that did not
affect the recall (mAR). Further work is needed to both increase the accuracy
of segmentation and enhances prediction with additional covariates affecting
decomposition. We hope this effort to be of help in other domains that require
weak segmentation and have limited availability of qualified annotators.
