With the rapid growth of information recommender systems have become integral for providing personalized suggestions and overcoming information overload. However their practical deployment often encounters dirty data where noise or malicious information can lead to abnormal recommendations. Research on improving recommender systems robustness against such dirty data has thus gained significant attention. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent work on recommender systems robustness. We first present a taxonomy to organize current techniques for withstanding malicious attacks and natural noise. We then explore state-of-the-art methods in each category including fraudster detection adversarial training certifiable robust training against malicious attacks and regularization purification self-supervised learning against natural noise. Additionally we summarize evaluation metrics and common datasets used to assess robustness. We discuss robustness across varying recommendation scenarios and its interplay with other properties like accuracy interpretability privacy and fairness. Finally we delve into open issues and future research directions in this emerging field. Our goal is to equip readers with a holistic understanding of robust recommender systems and spotlight pathways for future research and development.
