Variable-length splittable codes are derived from encoding sequences of
ordered integer pairs, where one of the pair's components is upper bounded by
some constant, and the other one is any positive integer. Each pair is encoded
by the concatenation of two fixed independent prefix encoding functions applied
to the corresponding components of a pair. The codeword of such a sequence of
pairs consists of the sequential concatenation of corresponding pair's
encodings. We call such codes splittable. We show that Fibonacci codes of
higher orders and codes with multiple delimiters of the form 011...10 are
splittable. Completeness and universality of multi-delimiter codes are proved.
Encoding of integers by multi-delimiter codes is considered in detail. For
these codes, a fast byte aligned decoding algorithm is constructed. The
comparative compression performance of Fibonacci codes and different
multi-delimiter codes is presented. By many useful properties, multi-delimiter
codes are superior to Fibonacci codes.
