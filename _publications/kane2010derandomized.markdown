Recent work of [Dasgupta-Kumar-Sarlos, STOC 2010] gave a sparse
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform and left as a main open question whether their
construction could be efficiently derandomized. We answer their question
affirmatively by giving an alternative proof of their result requiring only
bounded independence hash functions. Furthermore, the sparsity bound obtained
in our proof is improved. The main ingredient in our proof is a spectral moment
bound for quadratic forms that was recently used in [Diakonikolas-Kane-Nelson,
FOCS 2010].
