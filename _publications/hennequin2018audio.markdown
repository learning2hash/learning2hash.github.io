In this paper, we propose to infer music genre embeddings from audio datasets
carrying semantic information about genres. We show that such embeddings can be
used for disambiguating genre tags (identification of different labels for the
same genre, tag translation from a tag system to another, inference of
hierarchical taxonomies on these genre tags). These embeddings are built by
training a deep convolutional neural network genre classifier with large audio
datasets annotated with a flat tag system. We show empirically that they makes
it possible to retrieve the original taxonomy of a tag system, spot duplicates
tags and translate tags from a tag system to another.
