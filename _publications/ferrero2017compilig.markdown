We present our submitted systems for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Track
4 at SemEval-2017. Given a pair of Spanish-English sentences, each system must
estimate their semantic similarity by a score between 0 and 5. In our
submission, we use syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based, and MT-based
methods. We also combine these methods in unsupervised and supervised way. Our
best run ranked 1st on track 4a with a correlation of 83.02% with human
annotations.
