<p>Cuckoo Hashing is a hashing scheme invented by Pagh and Rodler. It
uses <span class="math inline">\(d\geq 2\)</span> distinct hash
functions to insert items into the hash table. It has been an open
question for some time as to the expected time for Random Walk Insertion
to add items. We show that if the number of hash functions <span
class="math inline">\(d=O(1)\)</span> is sufficiently large, then the
expected insertion time is <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> per
item.</p>
