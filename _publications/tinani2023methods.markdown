This paper focuses on devising methods for producing collisions in algebraic
hash functions that may be seen as generalized forms of the well-known Z\'emor
and Tillich-Z\'emor hash functions. In contrast to some of the previous
approaches, we attempt to construct collisions in a structured and
deterministic manner by constructing messages with triangular or diagonal
hashes messages. Our method thus provides an alternate deterministic approach
to the method for finding triangular hashes. We also consider the generalized
Tillich-Z\'emor hash functions over \(\{\mathbb\{F\}_p\}^k\) for \(p\neq 2\), relating
the generator matrices to a polynomial recurrence relation, and derive a closed
form for any arbitrary power of the generators. We then provide conditions for
collisions, and a method to maliciously design the system so as to facilitate
easy collisions, in terms of this polynomial recurrence relation. Our general
conclusion is that it is very difficult in practice to achieve the theoretical
collision conditions efficiently, in both the generalized Z\'emor and the
generalized Tillich-Z\'emor cases. Therefore, although the techniques are
interesting theoretically, in practice the collision-resistance of the
generalized Z\'emor functions is reinforced.
