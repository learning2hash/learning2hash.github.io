    Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979, are of great importance in computer science with many applications. MMH$^*$ is a well-known $\triangle$-universal hash function family, based on the evaluation of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MMH$^*$, that we call GMMH$^*$, using the same construction as MMH$^*$ but with an arbitrary integer modulus $n>1$, and show that GMMH$^*$ is $\frac{1}{p}$-almost-$\triangle$-universal, where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$. This bound is tight.
