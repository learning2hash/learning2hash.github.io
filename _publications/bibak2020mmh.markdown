<p>Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979,
are of great importance in computer science with many applications.
MMH<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span> is a well-known <span
class="math inline">\(\triangle\)</span>-universal hash function family,
based on the evaluation of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper,
we introduce a generalization of MMH<span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>, that we call GMMH<span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>, using the same construction as
MMH<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span> but with an arbitrary integer
modulus <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span>, and show that
GMMH<span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{p}\)</span>-almost-<span
class="math inline">\(\triangle\)</span>-universal, where <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the smallest prime divisor of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. This bound is tight.</p>
