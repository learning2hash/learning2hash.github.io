Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979, are of
great importance in computer science with many applications. MMH\{^*\} is a
well-known \{\triangle\}-universal hash function family, based on the evaluation
of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper, we introduce a generalization
of MMH\{^*\}, that we call GMMH\{^*\}, using the same construction as MMH\{^*\} but
with an arbitrary integer modulus \{n>1\}, and show that GMMH\{^*\} is
\{\frac{1}{p}\}-almost-\{\triangle\}-universal, where \{p\} is the smallest prime
divisor of \{n\}. This bound is tight.
