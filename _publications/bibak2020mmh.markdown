Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979, are of great importance in computer science with many applications. MMH\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(^*\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is a well-known \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\triangle\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-universal hash function family, based on the evaluation of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MMH\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(^*\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, that we call GMMH\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(^*\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, using the same construction as MMH\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(^*\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} but with an arbitrary integer modulus \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n>1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and show that GMMH\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(^*\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\frac\{1\}\{p\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-almost-\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\triangle\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-universal, where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(p\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is the smallest prime divisor of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. This bound is tight.
