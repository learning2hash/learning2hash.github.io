Universal hash functions, discovered by Carter and Wegman in 1979, are of
great importance in computer science with many applications. MMH\(^*\) is a
well-known \(\triangle\)-universal hash function family, based on the evaluation
of a dot product modulo a prime. In this paper, we introduce a generalization
of MMH\(^*\), that we call GMMH\(^*\), using the same construction as MMH\(^*\) but
with an arbitrary integer modulus \(n>1\), and show that GMMH\(^*\) is
\(\frac\{1\}\{p\}\)-almost-\(\triangle\)-universal, where \(p\) is the smallest prime
divisor of \(n\). This bound is tight.
