We construct and study the ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation of the product
of two hyperbolic planes \(\mathbb\{H\}_\{2\}\times \mathbb\{H\}_\{2\}\) endowed with the
\(L^\{1\}\) norm. We prove that its law is invariant under all isometries of this
space and study some geometric features of its cells. Among other things, we
prove that the set of points at equal separation to any two corona points is
unbounded almost surely. This is analogous to a recent result of
Fr\k\{a\}czyk-Mellick-Wilkens for higher rank symmetric spaces.
