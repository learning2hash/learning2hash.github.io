This paper presents watermarking algorithms using d-sequences so that the
peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is maximized and the distortion introduced in
the image due to the embedding is minimized. By exploiting the cross
correlation property of decimal sequences, the concept of embedding more than
one watermark in the same cover image is investigated.
