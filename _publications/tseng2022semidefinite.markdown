We study the upper bounds for \\(A(n,d)\\), the maximum size of codewords with
length \\(n\\) and Hamming distance at least \\(d\\). Schrijver studied the Terwilliger
algebra of the Hamming scheme and proposed a semidefinite program to bound
\\(A(n, d)\\). We derive more sophisticated matrix inequalities based on a split
Terwilliger algebra to improve Schrijver's semidefinite programming bounds on
\\(A(n, d)\\). In particular, we improve the semidefinite programming bounds on
\\(A(18,4)\\) to \\(6551\\).
