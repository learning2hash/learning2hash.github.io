Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies (STM/nc-AFM) are rapidly
progressing to offer unprecedented spatial resolution of a diverse array of
chemical species. In particular, they are employed to characterize on-surface
chemical reactions by directly examining precursors and products. Chiral
effects and self-assembled structures can also be investigated. This open
source, modular, python based scheme automates the categorization of a variety
of molecules present in medium sized (10\(\times\)10 to 100\(\times\)100 nm)
scanned probe images.
