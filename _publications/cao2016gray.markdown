Let \\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{p^m\}\\) be a finite field of cardinality \\(p^m\\), where \\(p\\) is a
prime, and \\(k, N\\) be any positive integers. We denote \\(R_k=F_\{p^m\}[u]/\langle
u^k\rangle =F_\{p^m\}+uF_\{p^m\}+\ldots+u^\{k-1\}F_\{p^m\}\\) (\\(u^k=0\\)) and
\\(\lambda=a_0+a_1u+\ldots+a_\{k-1\}u^\{k-1\}\\) where \\(a_0, a_1,\ldots, a_\{k-1\}\in
F_\{p^m\}\\) satisfying \\(a_0\neq 0\\) and \\(a_1=1\\). Let \\(r\\) be a positive integer
satisfying \\(p^\{r-1\}+1\leq k\leq p^r\\). We defined a Gray map from \\(R_k\\) to
\\(F_\{p^m\}^\{p^r\}\\) first, then prove that the Gray image of any linear
\\(\lambda\\)-constacyclic code over \\(R_k\\) of length \\(N\\) is a distance invariant
linear \\(a_0^\{p^r\}\\)-constacyclic code over \\(F_\{p^m\}\\) of length \\(p^rN\\).
Furthermore, the generator polynomials for each linear \\(\lambda\\)-constacyclic
code over \\(R_k\\) of length \\(N\\) and its Gray image are given respectively.
Finally, some optimal constacyclic codes over \\(F_\{3\}\\) and \\(F_\{5\}\\) are
constructed.
