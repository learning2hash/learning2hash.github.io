Aiming at the high cost of embedding annotation watermark in a narrow small
area and the information distortion caused by the change of annotation
watermark image resolution, this paper proposes a color block code technology,
which uses location information and color code to form recognizable graphics,
which can not only simplify the annotation graphics, but also ensure the
recognition efficiency. First, the constituent elements of color block code are
designed, and then the coding and decoding method of color block code is
proposed. Experiments show that color block code has high anti-scaling and
anti-interference, and can be widely used in the labeling of small object
surface and low resolution image.
