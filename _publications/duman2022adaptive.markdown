A scanning pixel camera is a novel low-cost, low-power sensor that is not
diffraction limited. It produces data as a sequence of samples extracted from
various parts of the scene during the course of a scan. It can provide very
detailed images at the expense of samplerates and slow image acquisition time.
This paper proposes a new algorithm which allows the sensor to adapt the
samplerate over the course of this sequence. This makes it possible to overcome
some of these limitations by minimising the bandwidth and time required to
image and transmit a scene, while maintaining image quality. We examine
applications to image classification and semantic segmentation and are able to
achieve similar results compared to a fully sampled input, while using 80%
fewer samples
