We prove a tight lower bound for the exponent ρ for data45;dependent Locality45;Sensitive Hashing schemes recently used to design efficient solutions for the c45;approximate nearest neighbor search. In particular our lower bound matches the bound of ρle frac123;1125;123;2c45;1125;+o(1) for the ell95;1 space obtained via the recent algorithm from Andoni45;Razenshteyn STOC15. In recent years it emerged that data45;dependent hashing is strictly superior to the classical Locality45;Sensitive Hashing when the hash function is data45;independent. In the latter setting the best exponent has been already known for the ell95;1 space the tight bound is ρ=1/c with the upper bound from Indyk45;Motwani STOC98 and the matching lower bound from ODonnell45;Wu45;Zhou ITCS11. We prove that even if the hashing is data45;dependent it must hold that ρge frac123;1125;123;2c45;1125;45;o(1). To prove the result we need to formalize the exact notion of data45;dependent hashing that also captures the complexity of the hash functions (in addition to their collision properties). Without restricting such complexity we would allow for obviously infeasible solutions such as the Voronoi diagram of a dataset. To preclude such solutions we require our hash functions to be succinct. This condition is satisfied by all the known algorithmic results.
