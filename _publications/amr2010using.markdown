Although content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is not a new subject, it keeps attracting more and more attention, as the amount of images grow tremendously due to internet, inexpensive hardware and automation of image acquisition. One of the applications of CBIR is fetching images from a database. This paper presents a new method for automatic image retrieval using moment invariants and image entropy, our technique could be used to find semi or perfect matches based on query by example manner, experimental results demonstrate that the purposed technique is scalable and efficient.
