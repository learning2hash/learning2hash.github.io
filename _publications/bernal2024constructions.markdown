In this note, we apply some techniques developed in [1]-[3] to give a
particular construction of bivariate Abelian Codes from cyclic codes,
multiplying their dimension and preserving their apparent distance. We show
that, in the case of cyclic codes whose maximum BCH bound equals its minimum
distance the obtained abelian code verifies the same property; that is, the
strong apparent distance and the minimum distance coincide. We finally use this
construction to multiply Reed-Solomon codes to abelian codes
