This paper describes the methodology followed and the lessons learned from
employing crowdsourcing techniques as part of a homework assignment involving
higher education students of computer science. Making use of a platform that
supports crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage domain students were solicited
to enrich the metadata associated with a selection of music tracks. The results
of the campaign were further analyzed and exploited by students through the use
of semantic web technologies. In total, 98 students participated in the
campaign, contributing more than 6400 annotations concerning 854 tracks. The
process also led to the creation of an openly available annotated dataset,
which can be useful for machine learning models for music tagging. The
campaign's results and the comments gathered through an online survey enable us
to draw some useful insights about the benefits and challenges of integrating
crowdsourcing into computer science curricula and how this can enhance
students' engagement in the learning process.
