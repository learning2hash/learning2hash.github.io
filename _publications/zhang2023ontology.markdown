Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZSSBIR) is an emerging task. The
pioneering work focused on the modal gap but ignored inter-class information.
Although recent work has begun to consider the triplet-based or contrast-based
loss to mine inter-class information, positive and negative samples need to be
carefully selected, or the model is prone to lose modality-specific
information. To respond to these issues, an Ontology-Aware Network (OAN) is
proposed. Specifically, the smooth inter-class independence learning mechanism
is put forward to maintain inter-class peculiarity. Meanwhile,
distillation-based consistency preservation is utilized to keep
modality-specific information. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
superior performance of our algorithm on two challenging Sketchy and Tu-Berlin
datasets.
