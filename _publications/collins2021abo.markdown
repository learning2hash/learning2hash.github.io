We introduce Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO), a new large-scale dataset
designed to help bridge the gap between real and virtual 3D worlds. ABO
contains product catalog images, metadata, and artist-created 3D models with
complex geometries and physically-based materials that correspond to real,
household objects. We derive challenging benchmarks that exploit the unique
properties of ABO and measure the current limits of the state-of-the-art on
three open problems for real-world 3D object understanding: single-view 3D
reconstruction, material estimation, and cross-domain multi-view object
retrieval.
