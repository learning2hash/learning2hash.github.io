Fractal image compression has some desirable properties like high quality at
high compression ratio, fast decoding, and resolution independence. Therefore
it can be used for many applications such as texture mapping and pattern
recognition and image watermarking. But it suffers from long encoding time due
to its need to find the best match between sub blocks. This time is related to
the approach that is used. In this paper we present a fast encoding Algorithm
based on no search method. Our goal is that more blocks are covered in initial
step of quad tree algorithm. Experimental result has been compared with other
new fast fractal coding methods, showing it is better in term of bit rate in
same condition while the other parameters are fixed.
