We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on \(n\) bits that
are induced from Boolean functions on \(k\) bits, for \(k\leq n\). We consider such
functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost
bijective, and their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an
almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the
number of collisions of its induced functions that does not depend on \(n\). We
show that if a Boolean function with diameter \(k\) is an almost lifting, then
the maximum number of collisions of its induced functions is \(2^\{k-1\}\) for any
\(n\). Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that
have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not
cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map
\(\chi\) used in the Keccak hash function.
