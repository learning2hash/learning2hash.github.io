We describe Machine-Aided Script Curator (MASC), a system for human-machine
collaborative script authoring. Scripts produced with MASC include (1) English
descriptions of sub-events that comprise a larger, complex event; (2) event
types for each of those events; (3) a record of entities expected to
participate in multiple sub-events; and (4) temporal sequencing between the
sub-events. MASC automates portions of the script creation process with
suggestions for event types, links to Wikidata, and sub-events that may have
been forgotten. We illustrate how these automations are useful to the script
writer with a few case-study scripts.
