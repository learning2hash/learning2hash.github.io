Gang affiliates have joined the masses who use social media to share thoughts
and actions publicly. Interestingly, they use this public medium to express
recent illegal actions, to intimidate others, and to share outrageous images
and statements. Agencies able to unearth these profiles may thus be able to
anticipate, stop, or hasten the investigation of gang-related crimes. This
paper investigates the use of word embeddings to help identify gang members on
Twitter. Building on our previous work, we generate word embeddings that
translate what Twitter users post in their profile descriptions, tweets,
profile images, and linked YouTube content to a real vector format amenable for
machine learning classification. Our experimental results show that pre-trained
word embeddings can boost the accuracy of supervised learning algorithms
trained over gang members social media posts.
