When visualizing a high-dimensional dataset, dimension reduction techniques
are commonly employed which provide a single 2-dimensional view of the data. We
describe ENS-t-SNE: an algorithm for Embedding Neighborhoods Simultaneously
that generalizes the t-Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding approach. By using
different viewpoints in ENS-t-SNE's 3D embedding, one can visualize different
types of clusters within the same high-dimensional dataset. This enables the
viewer to see and keep track of the different types of clusters, which is
harder to do when providing multiple 2D embeddings, where corresponding points
cannot be easily identified. We illustrate the utility of ENS-t-SNE with
real-world applications and provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with
datasets of different types and sizes.
