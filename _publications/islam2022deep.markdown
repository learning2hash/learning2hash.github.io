A deep learning model gives an incredible result for image processing by
studying from the trained dataset. Spinach is a leaf vegetable that contains
vitamins and nutrients. In our research, a Deep learning method has been used
that can automatically identify spinach and this method has a dataset of a
total of five species of spinach that contains 3785 images. Four Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models were used to classify our spinach. These models
give more accurate results for image classification. Before applying these
models there is some preprocessing of the image data. For the preprocessing of
data, some methods need to happen. Those are RGB conversion, filtering, resize
& rescaling, and categorization. After applying these methods image data are
pre-processed and ready to be used in the classifier algorithms. The accuracy
of these classifiers is in between 98.68% - 99.79%. Among those models, VGG16
achieved the highest accuracy of 99.79%.
