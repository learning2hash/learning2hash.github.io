With the rapid development of online services recommender systems (RS) have become increasingly indispensable for mitigating information overload. Despite remarkable progress conventional recommendation models (CRM) still have some limitations e.g. lacking open-world knowledge and difficulties in comprehending users underlying preferences and motivations. Meanwhile large language models (LLM) have shown impressive general intelligence and human-like capabilities which mainly stem from their extensive open-world knowledge reasoning ability as well as their comprehension of human culture and society. Consequently the emergence of LLM is inspiring the design of recommender systems and pointing out a promising research direction i.e. whether we can incorporate LLM and benefit from their knowledge and capabilities to compensate for the limitations of CRM. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive survey on this research direction from the perspective of the whole pipeline in real-world recommender systems. Specifically we summarize existing works from two orthogonal aspects where and how to adapt LLM to RS. For the WHERE question we discuss the roles that LLM could play in different stages of the recommendation pipeline i.e. feature engineering feature encoder scoring/ranking function user interaction and pipeline controller. For the HOW question we investigate the training and inference strategies resulting in two fine-grained taxonomy criteria i.e. whether to tune LLM or not and whether to involve conventional recommendation models for inference. Then we highlight key challenges in adapting LLM to RS from three aspects i.e. efficiency effectiveness and ethics. Finally we summarize the survey and discuss the future prospects.
