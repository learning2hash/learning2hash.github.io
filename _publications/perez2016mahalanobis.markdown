With the massive data challenges nowadays and the rapid growing of
technology, stream mining has recently received considerable attention. To
address the large number of scenarios in which this phenomenon manifests itself
suitable tools are required in various research fields. Instance-based data
stream algorithms generally employ the Euclidean distance for the
classification task underlying this problem. A novel way to look into this
issue is to take advantage of a more flexible metric due to the increased
requirements imposed by the data stream scenario. In this paper we present a
new algorithm that learns a Mahalanobis metric using similarity and
dissimilarity constraints in an online manner. This approach hybridizes a
Mahalanobis distance metric learning algorithm and a k-NN data stream
classification algorithm with concept drift detection. First, some basic
aspects of Mahalanobis distance metric learning are described taking into
account key properties as well as online distance metric learning algorithms.
Second, we implement specific evaluation methodologies and comparative metrics
such as Q statistic for data stream classification algorithms. Finally, our
algorithm is evaluated on different datasets by comparing its results with one
of the best instance-based data stream classification algorithm of the state of
the art. The results demonstrate that our proposal is better
