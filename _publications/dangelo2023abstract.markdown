Algorithms for deriving Huffman codes and the recently developed algorithm
for compiling PIFO trees to trees of fixed shape (Mohan et al. 2022) are
similar, but work with different underlying algebraic operations. In this
paper, we exploit the monadic structure of prefix codes to create a generalized
Huffman algorithm that has these two applications as special cases.
