We give a new and simple worst-case optimal algorithm for adaptive
prefix-free coding that matches Gagie and Nekrich's bounds except for
lower-order terms, and uses no data structures more complicated than a lookup
table. Moreover, when Gagie and Nekrich's algorithm is modified for adaptive
alphabetic prefix-free coding its decoding time slows down to \(O (log log n)\)
per character, but ours can be modified for this problem with no asymptotic
slowdown. As far as we know, this gives the first algorithm for this alphabetic
problem that is simultaneously worst-case optimal in terms of encoding and
decoding time and of encoding length.
