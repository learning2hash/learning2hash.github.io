*A maximal distance minimizer* for a given compact set \(M \subset
\mathbb\{R\}^2\) and some given \(r > 0\) is a set having the minimal length
(one-dimensional Hausdorff measure) over the class of closed connected sets
\(\Sigma \subset \mathbb\{R\}^2\) satisfying the inequality \[ \max_\{y\in M\} dist
(y, \Sigma) \leq r. \] This paper deals with the set of maximal distance
minimizers for a rectangle \(M\) and small enough \(r\).
