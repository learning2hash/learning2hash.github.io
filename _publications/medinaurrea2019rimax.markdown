This paper presents RIMAX, a new system for detecting semantic rhymes, using
a Comprehensive Mexican Spanish Dictionary (DEM) and its Rhyming Dictionary
(REM). We use the Vector Space Model to calculate the similarity of the
definition of a query with the definitions corresponding to the assonant and
consonant rhymes of the query. The preliminary results using a manual
evaluation are very encouraging.
