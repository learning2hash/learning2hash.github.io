In this paper, we study a relative two-weight \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2
\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-additive codes. It is shown that the Gray image of a two-distance
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_2 \mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-additive code is a binary two-distance code and
that the Gray image of a relative two-weight \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2
\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-additive code, with nontrivial binary part, is a linear binary
relative two-weight code. The structure of relative two-weight \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2
\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-additive codes are described. Finally, we discussed permutation
automorphism group of a \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2 \mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-additive codes.
