Incremental few-shot learning has emerged as a new and challenging area in
deep learning, whose objective is to train deep learning models using very few
samples of new class data, and none of the old class data. In this work we
tackle the problem of batch incremental few-shot road object detection using
data from the India Driving Dataset (IDD). Our approach, DualFusion, combines
object detectors in a manner that allows us to learn to detect rare objects
with very limited data, all without severely degrading the performance of the
detector on the abundant classes. In the IDD OpenSet incremental few-shot
detection task, we achieve a mAP50 score of 40.0 on the base classes and an
overall mAP50 score of 38.8, both of which are the highest to date. In the COCO
batch incremental few-shot detection task, we achieve a novel AP score of 9.9,
surpassing the state-of-the-art novel class performance on the same by over 6.6
times.
