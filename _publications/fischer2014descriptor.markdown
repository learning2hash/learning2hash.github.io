Latest results indicate that features learned via convolutional neural
networks outperform previous descriptors on classification tasks by a large
margin. It has been shown that these networks still work well when they are
applied to datasets or recognition tasks different from those they were trained
on. However, descriptors like SIFT are not only used in recognition but also
for many correspondence problems that rely on descriptor matching. In this
paper we compare features from various layers of convolutional neural nets to
standard SIFT descriptors. We consider a network that was trained on ImageNet
and another one that was trained without supervision. Surprisingly,
convolutional neural networks clearly outperform SIFT on descriptor matching.
