In this paper we propose a simple and efficient data structure yielding a
perfect hashing of quite general arrays. The data structure is named phorma,
which is an acronym for perfectly hashable order restricted multidimensional
array.
  Keywords: Perfect hash function, Digraph, Implicit enumeration,
Nijenhuis-Wilf combinatorial family.
