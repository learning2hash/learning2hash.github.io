With the recent rise in popularity and size of
social media, there is a growing need for systems
that can extract useful information from
this amount of data. We address the problem
of detecting new events from a stream of
Twitter posts. To make event detection feasible
on web-scale corpora, we present an algorithm
based on locality-sensitive hashing which
is able overcome the limitations of traditional
approaches, while maintaining competitive results.
In particular, a comparison with a stateof-the-art
system on the first story detection
task shows that we achieve over an order of
magnitude speedup in processing time, while
retaining comparable performance. Event detection
experiments on a collection of 160 million
Twitter posts show that celebrity deaths
are the fastest spreading news on Twitter.
