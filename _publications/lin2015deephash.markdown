This work focuses on representing very high45;dimensional global image descriptors using very compact 6445;1024 bit binary hashes for instance retrieval. We propose DeepHash a hashing scheme based on deep networks. Key to making DeepHash work at extremely low bitrates are three important considerations 45;45; regularization depth and fine45;tuning 45;45; each requiring solutions specific to the hashing problem. In45;depth evaluation shows that our scheme consistently outperforms state45;of45;the45;art methods across all data sets for both Fisher Vectors and Deep Convolutional Neural Network features by up to 20 percent over other schemes. The retrieval performance with 25645;bit hashes is close to that of the uncompressed floating point features 45;45; a remarkable 512 times compression.
