<p>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) constitutes an important
operation in a multitude of applications, including recommendation
systems, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. In the past
decade, graph-based ANNS algorithms have been the leading paradigm in
this domain, with dozens of graph-based ANNS algorithms proposed. Such
algorithms aim to provide effective, efficient solutions for retrieving
the nearest neighbors for a given query. Nevertheless, these efforts
focus on developing and optimizing algorithms with different approaches,
so there is a real need for a comprehensive survey about the approaches’
relative performance, strengths, and pitfalls. Thus here we provide a
thorough comparative analysis and experimental evaluation of 13
representative graph-based ANNS algorithms via a new taxonomy and
fine-grained pipeline. We compared each algorithm in a uniform test
environment on eight real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets with
varying sizes and characteristics. Our study yields novel discoveries,
offerings several useful principles to improve algorithms, thus
designing an optimized method that outperforms the state-of-the-art
algorithms. This effort also helped us pinpoint algorithms’ working
portions, along with rule-of-thumb recommendations about promising
research directions and suitable algorithms for practitioners in
different fields.</p>
