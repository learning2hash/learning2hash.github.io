Few-shot classification involves identifying new categories using a limited
number of labeled samples. Current few-shot classification methods based on
local descriptors primarily leverage underlying consistent features across
visible and invisible classes, facing challenges including redundant
neighboring information, noisy representations, and limited interpretability.
This paper proposes a Feature Aligning Few-shot Learning Method Using Local
Descriptors Weighted Rules (FAFD-LDWR). It innovatively introduces a
cross-normalization method into few-shot image classification to preserve the
discriminative information of local descriptors as much as possible; and
enhances classification performance by aligning key local descriptors of
support and query sets to remove background noise. FAFD-LDWR performs
excellently on three benchmark datasets , outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. The designed visualization
experiments also demonstrate FAFD-LDWR's improvement in prediction
interpretability.
