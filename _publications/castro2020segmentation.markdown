The Fashion Industry is a strong and important industry in the global
economy. Globalization has brought fast fashion, quick shifting consumer
shopping preferences, more competition, and abundance in fashion shops and
retailers, making it more difficult for professionals in the fashion industry
to keep track of what fashion items people wear and how they combine them. This
paper solves this problem by implementing several Deep Learning Architectures
using the iMaterialist dataset consisting of 45,000 images with 46 different
clothing and apparel categories.
