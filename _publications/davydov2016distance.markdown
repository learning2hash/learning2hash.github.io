We are interested in the estimation of the distance in total variation $\\(
\Delta := \|P_\{f(X)\} - P_\{g(X)\}\|_\{\mathrm var\} \\)\\( between distributions of
random variables \\)f(X)\\( and \\)g(X)\\( in terms of proximity of \\)f\\( and \\)g.\\( We
propose a simple general method of estimating \\)\Delta\\(. For Gaussian and
trigonometrical polynomials it gives an asymptotically optimal result (when the
degree tends to \\)\infty$).
