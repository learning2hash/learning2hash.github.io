We consider the model of hashing with linear probing and we establish the
moderate and large deviations for the total displacement in sparse tables. In
this context, Weibull-like-tailed random variables appear. Deviations for sums
of such heavy-tailed random variables are studied in
\cite\{Nagaev69-1,Nagaev69-2\}. Here we adapt the proofs therein to deal with
conditioned sums of such variables and solve the open question in \cite\{TFC12\}.
By the way, we establish the deviations of the total displacement in full
tables, which can be derived from the deviations of empirical processes of
i.i.d.\ random variables established in \cite\{Wu94\}..
