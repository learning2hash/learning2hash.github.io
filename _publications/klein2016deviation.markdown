<p>We consider the model of hashing with linear probing and we establish
the moderate and large deviations for the total displacement in sparse
tables. In this context, Weibull-like-tailed random variables appear.
Deviations for sums of such heavy-tailed random variables are studied in
. Here we adapt the proofs therein to deal with conditioned sums of such
variables and solve the open question in . By the way, we establish the
deviations of the total displacement in full tables, which can be
derived from the deviations of empirical processes of i.i.d. random
variables established in ..</p>
