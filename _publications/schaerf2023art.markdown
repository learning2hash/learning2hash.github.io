In recent years, Transformers, initially developed for language, have been
successfully applied to visual tasks. Vision Transformers have been shown to
push the state-of-the-art in a wide range of tasks, including image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. While ample
research has shown promising results in art attribution and art authentication
tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks, this paper examines if the
superiority of Vision Transformers extends to art authentication, improving,
thus, the reliability of computer-based authentication of artworks. Using a
carefully compiled dataset of authentic paintings by Vincent van Gogh and two
contrast datasets, we compare the art authentication performances of Swin
Transformers with those of EfficientNet. Using a standard contrast set
containing imitations and proxies (works by painters with styles closely
related to van Gogh), we find that EfficientNet achieves the best performance
overall. With a contrast set that only consists of imitations, we find the Swin
Transformer to be superior to EfficientNet by achieving an authentication
accuracy of over 85%. These results lead us to conclude that Vision
Transformers represent a strong and promising contender in art authentication,
particularly in enhancing the computer-based ability to detect artistic
imitations.
