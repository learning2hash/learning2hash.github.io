A new definition of random sets is proposed. It is based on the distance in
measurable space and uses negative definite kernels for continuation from
initial space to that of random sets. This approach has no connection to
Hausdorff distance between sets.
  Key words: random sets; measurable space; negative definite kernels; Hilbert
space isometries.
