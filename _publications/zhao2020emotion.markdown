Both images and music can convey rich semantics and are widely used to induce
specific emotions. Matching images and music with similar emotions might help
to make emotion perceptions more vivid and stronger. Existing emotion-based
image and music matching methods either employ limited categorical emotion
states which cannot well reflect the complexity and subtlety of emotions, or
train the matching model using an impractical multi-stage pipeline. In this
paper, we study end-to-end matching between image and music based on emotions
in the continuous valence-arousal (VA) space. First, we construct a large-scale
dataset, termed Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet), with over 140K
image-music pairs. Second, we propose cross-modal deep continuous metric
learning (CDCML) to learn a shared latent embedding space which preserves the
cross-modal similarity relationship in the continuous matching space. Finally,
we refine the embedding space by further preserving the single-modal emotion
relationship in the VA spaces of both images and music. The metric learning in
the embedding space and task regression in the label space are jointly
optimized for both cross-modal matching and single-modal VA prediction. The
extensive experiments conducted on IMEMNet demonstrate the superiority of CDCML
for emotion-based image and music matching as compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches.
