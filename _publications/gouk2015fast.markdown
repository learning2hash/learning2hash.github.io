Similarity metrics are a core component of many information retrieval and
machine learning systems. In this work we propose a method capable of learning
a similarity metric from data equipped with a binary relation. By considering
only the similarity constraints, and initially ignoring the features, we are
able to learn target vectors for each instance using one of several
appropriately designed loss functions. A regression model can then be
constructed that maps novel feature vectors to the same target vector space,
resulting in a feature extractor that computes vectors for which a predefined
metric is a meaningful measure of similarity. We present results on both
multiclass and multi-label classification datasets that demonstrate
considerably faster convergence, as well as higher accuracy on the majority of
the intrinsic evaluation tasks and all extrinsic evaluation tasks.
