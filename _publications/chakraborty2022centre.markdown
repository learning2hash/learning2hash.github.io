Facial features are defined as the local relationships that exist amongst the
pixels of a facial image. Hand-crafted descriptors identify the relationships of
the pixels in the local neighbourhood defined by the kernel. Kernel is a two
dimensional matrix which is moved across the facial image. Distinctive
information captured by the kernel with limited number of pixel achieves
satisfactory recognition and retrieval accuracies on facial images taken under
constrained environment (controlled variations in light, pose, expressions, and
background). To achieve similar accuracies under unconstrained environment local
neighbourhood has to be increased, in order to encode more pixels. Increasing
local neighbourhood also increases the feature length of the descriptor. In this
paper we propose a hand-crafted descriptor namely Centre Symmetric Quadruple
Pattern (CSQP), which is structurally symmetric and encodes the facial asymmetry
in quadruple space. The proposed descriptor efficiently encodes larger
neighbourhood with optimal number of binary bits. It has been shown using
average entropy, computed over feature images encoded with the proposed
descriptor, that the CSQP captures more meaningful information as compared to
state of the art descriptors. The retrieval and recognition accuracies of the
proposed descriptor has been compared with state of the art hand-crafted
descriptors (CSLBP, CSLTP, LDP, LBP, SLBP and LDGP) on bench mark databases
namely; LFW, Colour-FERET, and CASIA-face-v5. Result analysis shows that the
proposed descriptor performs well under controlled as well as uncontrolled
variations in pose, illumination, background and expressions.
