In this paper, we determine the almost sure values of the \(\Phi \)-dimensions
of random measures supported on random Moran sets that satisfy a uniform
separation condition. The \(\Phi \)-dimensions are intermediate Assouad-like
dimensions, the (quasi-)Assouad dimensions and \(\theta \)-Assouad spectrum being
special cases. Their values depend on the size of \(\Phi \), with one size
coinciding with the Assouad dimension and the other coinciding with the
quasi-Assouad dimension. We give many applications, including to
equicontractive self-similar measures and \(1\)-variable random Moran measures
such as Cantor-like measures with probabilities that are uniformly distributed.
We can also deduce the \(\Phi \)-dimensions of the underlying random sets.
