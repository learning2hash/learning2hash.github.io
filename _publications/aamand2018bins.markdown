We consider the hashing of a set XâŠ† U with X=m using a simple tabulation hash function hUto n=123;0dotsn45;1125; and analyse the number of non45;empty bins that is the size of h(X). We show that the expected size of h(X) matches that with fully random hashing to within low45;order terms. We also provide concentration bounds. The number of non45;empty bins is a fundamental measure in the balls and bins paradigm and it is critical in applications such as Bloom filters and Filter hashing. For example normally Bloom filters are proportioned for a desired low false45;positive probability assuming fully random hashing (see url123;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom95;filter125;). Our results imply that if we implement the hashing with simple tabulation we obtain the same low false45;positive probability for any possible input.
