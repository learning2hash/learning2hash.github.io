In the 1970s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency sponsored
Documerica, a large-scale photography initiative to document environmental
subjects nation-wide. While over 15,000 digitized public-domain photographs
from the collection are available online, most of the images were scanned from
damaged copies of the original prints. We present and evaluate a modified
histogram matching technique based on the underlying chemistry of the prints
for correcting the damaged images by using training data collected from a small
set of undamaged prints. The entire set of color-adjusted Documerica images is
made available in an open repository.
