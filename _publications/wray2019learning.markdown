This work introduces verb-only representations for both recognition and
retrieval of visual actions, in video. Current methods neglect legitimate
semantic ambiguities between verbs, instead choosing unambiguous subsets of
verbs along with objects to disambiguate the actions. We instead propose
multiple verb-only labels, which we learn through hard or soft assignment as a
regression. This enables learning a much larger vocabulary of verbs, including
contextual overlaps of these verbs. We collect multi-verb annotations for three
action video datasets and evaluate the verb-only labelling representations for
action recognition and cross-modal retrieval (video-to-text and text-to-video).
We demonstrate that multi-label verb-only representations outperform
conventional single verb labels. We also explore other benefits of a multi-verb
representation including cross-dataset retrieval and verb type manner and
result verb types) retrieval.
