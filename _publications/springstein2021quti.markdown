The World Wide Web and social media platforms have become popular sources for
news and information. Typically, multimodal information, e.g., image and text
is used to convey information more effectively and to attract attention. While
in most cases image content is decorative or depicts additional information, it
has also been leveraged to spread misinformation and rumors in recent years. In
this paper, we present a Web-based demo application that automatically
quantifies the cross-modal relations of entities (persons, locations, and
events) in image and text. The applications are manifold. For example, the
system can help users to explore multimodal articles more efficiently, or can
assist human assessors and fact-checking efforts in the verification of the
credibility of news stories, tweets, or other multimodal documents.
