Wikipedia is a useful knowledge source that benefits many applications in
language processing and knowledge representation. An important feature of
Wikipedia is that of categories. Wikipedia pages are assigned different
categories according to their contents as human-annotated labels which can be
used in information retrieval, ad hoc search improvements, entity ranking and
tag recommendations. However, important pages are usually assigned too many
categories, which makes it difficult to recognize the most important ones that
give the best descriptions.
  In this paper, we propose an approach to recognize the most descriptive
Wikipedia categories. We observe that historical figures in a precise category
presumably are mutually similar and such categorical coherence could be
evaluated via texts or Wikipedia links of corresponding members in the
category. We rank descriptive level of Wikipedia categories according to their
coherence and our ranking yield an overall agreement of 88.27% compared with
human wisdom.
