Consider a random polynomial \\(Q_n\\) of degree \\(n+1\\) whose zeroes are i.i.d.
random variables \\(\xi_0,\xi_1,\ldots,\xi_n\\) in the complex plane. We study the
pairing between the zeroes of \\(Q_n\\) and its critical points, i.e. the zeroes of
its derivative \\(Q_n'\\). In the asymptotic regime when \\(n\to\infty\\), with high
probability there is a critical point of \\(Q_n\\) which is very close to \\(\xi_0\\).
We localize the position of this critical point by proving that the difference
between \\(\xi_0\\) and the critical point has approximately complex Gaussian
distribution with mean \\(1/(nf(\xi_0))\\) and variance of order \\(log n \cdot
n^\{-3\}\\). Here, \\(f(z)= \mathbb E[1/(z-\xi_k)]\\) is the Cauchy-Stieltjes transform
of the \\(\xi_k\\)'s. We also state some conjectures on critical points of
polynomials with dependent zeroes, for example the Weyl polynomials and
characteristic polynomials of random matrices.
