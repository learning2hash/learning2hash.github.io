Basic group of visual techniques such as color, shape, texture are used in
Content Based Image Retrievals (CBIR) to retrieve query image or subregion of
image to find similar images in image database. To improve query result,
relevance feedback is used many times in CBIR to help user to express their
preference and improve query results.In this paper, a new approach for image
retrieval is proposed which is based on the features such as Color Histogram,
Eigen Values and Match Point. Images from various types of database are first
identified by using edge detection techniques.Once the image is identified,
then the image is searched in the particular database, then all related images
are displayed. This will save the retrieval time. Further to retrieve the
precise query image, any of the three techniques are used and comparison is
done w.r.t. average retrieval time. Eigen value technique found to be the best
as compared with other two techniques
