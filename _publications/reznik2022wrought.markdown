We've built a web-based tool for the real-time interaction with loci of
Poncelet triangle families. Our initial goals were to facilitate exploratory
detection of geometric properties of such families. During frequent walks in my
neighborhood, it appeared to me Poncelet loci shared a palette of motifs with
those found in wrought iron gates at the entrance of many a residential
building. As a result, I started to look at Poncelet loci aesthetically, a kind
of generative art. Features were gradually added to the tool with the sole
purpose of beautifying the output. Hundreds of interesting loci were
subsequently collected into an online "gallery", with some further enhanced by
a graphic designer. We will tour some of these byproducts here. An interesting
question is if Poncelet loci could serve as the basis for future metalwork
and/or architectural designs.
