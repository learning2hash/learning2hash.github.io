A minimum storage regenerating (MSR) subspace family of \(\mathbb\{F\}_q^\{2m\}\)
is a set \(\mathcal\{S\}\) of \(m\)-spaces in \(\mathbb\{F\}_q^\{2m\}\) such that for any
\(m\)-space \(S\) in \(\mathcal\{S\}\) there exists an element in \(\mathrm\{PGL\}(2m, q)\)
which maps \(S\) to a complement and fixes \(\mathcal\{S\} \setminus \\{ S \\}\)
pointwise. We show that an MSR subspace family of \(2\)-spaces in
\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^4\) has at most size \(6\) with equality if and only if it is a
particular subset of a Segre variety. This implies that an \((n, n-2, 4)\)-MSR
code has \(n \leq 9\).
