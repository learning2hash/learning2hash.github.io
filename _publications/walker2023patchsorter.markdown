The discovery of patterns associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy
response in digital pathology images often requires intractable labeling of
large quantities of histological objects. Here we release an open-source
labeling tool, PatchSorter, which integrates deep learning with an intuitive
web interface. Using >100,000 objects, we demonstrate a >7x improvement in
labels per second over unaided labeling, with minimal impact on labeling
accuracy, thus enabling high-throughput labeling of large datasets.
