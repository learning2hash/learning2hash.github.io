The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) for random variables or random vectors
with different mathematical expectations easily reduces by means of shifts to
SLLN for random variables or random vectors whose mathematical expectations are
equal to zero. The situation changes for random sets, where shifts cannot
reduce sets of more than one point to the set \(\\{0\\}\). We study effects that
appear because of this difference.
