We show that linear probing requires 5-independent hash functions for expected constant-time performance, matching an upper bound of [Pagh et al. STOC'07]. More precisely, we construct a 4-independent hash functions yielding expected logarithmic search time. For (1+&amp;\#123;\epsilon&amp;\#125;)-approximate minwise independence, we show that \Omega(log 1/&amp;\#123;\epsilon&amp;\#125;)-independent hash functions are required, matching an upper bound of [Indyk, SODA'99]. We also show that the very fast 2-independent multiply-shift scheme of Dietzfelbinger [STACS'96] fails badly in both applications.
