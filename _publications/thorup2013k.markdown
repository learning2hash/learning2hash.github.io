We show that linear probing requires 5-independent hash functions for expected constant-time performance matching an upper bound of Pagh et al. STOC07. More precisely we construct a 4-independent hash functions yielding expected logarithmic search time. For (1+epsilon)-approximate minwise independence we show that Omega(log 1/epsilon)-independent hash functions are required matching an upper bound of Indyk SODA99. We also show that the very fast 2-independent multiply-shift scheme of Dietzfelbinger STACS96 fails badly in both applications.
