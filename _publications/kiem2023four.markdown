We study a generalization of a famous result of Goodman and establish that
asymptotically at least a \(1/256\) fraction of all triangles needs to be
monochromatic in any four-coloring of the edges of a complete graph. We also
show that any large enough extremal construction must be based on a blow-up of
one of the two \(R(3,3,3)\) Ramsey-colorings of \(K_\{16\}\). This result is obtained
through an efficient flag algebra formulation by exploiting problem-specific
combinatorial symmetries that also allows us to study some related problems.
