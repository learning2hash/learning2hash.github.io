Generic text embeddings are successfully used in a variety of tasks. However,
they are often learnt by capturing the co-occurrence structure from pure text
corpora, resulting in limitations of their ability to generalize. In this
paper, we explore models that incorporate visual information into the text
representation. Based on comprehensive ablation studies, we propose a
conceptually simple, yet well performing architecture. It outperforms previous
multimodal approaches on a set of well established benchmarks. We also improve
the state-of-the-art results for image-related text datasets, using orders of
magnitude less data.
