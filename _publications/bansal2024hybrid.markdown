Due to the growing volume of user generated content, hashtags are employed as
topic indicators to manage content efficiently on social media platforms.
However, finding these vital topics is challenging in microvideos since they
contain substantial information in a short duration. Existing methods that
recommend hashtags for microvideos primarily focus on content and
personalization while disregarding relatedness among users. Moreover, the cold
start user issue prevails in hashtag recommendation systems. Considering the
above, we propose a hybrid filtering based MIcro-video haSHtag recommendatiON
MISHON technique to recommend hashtags for micro-videos. Besides content based
filtering, we employ user-based collaborative filtering to enhance
recommendations. Since hashtags reflect users topical interests, we find
similar users based on historical tagging behavior to model user relatedness.
We employ a graph-based deep neural network to model user to user, modality to
modality, and user to modality interactions. We then use refined modality
specific and user representations to recommend pertinent hashtags for
microvideos. The empirical results on three real world datasets demonstrate
that MISHON attains a comparative enhancement of 3.6, 2.8, and 6.5 reported in
percentage concerning the F1 score, respectively. Since cold start users exist
whose historical tagging information is unavailable, we also propose a content
and social influence based technique to model the relatedness of cold start
users with influential users. The proposed solution shows a relative
improvement of 15.8 percent in the F1 score over its content only counterpart.
These results show that the proposed framework mitigates the cold start user
problem.
