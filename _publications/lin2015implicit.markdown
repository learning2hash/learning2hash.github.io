We address the problem of converting large45;scale high45;dimensional image data into binary codes so that approximate nearest45;neighbor search over them can be efficiently performed. Different from most of the existing unsupervised approaches for yielding binary codes our method is based on a dimensionality45;reduction criterion that its resulting mapping is designed to preserve the image relationships entailed by the inner products of sparse codes rather than those implied by the Euclidean distances in the ambient space. While the proposed formulation does not require computing any sparse codes the underlying computation model still inevitably involves solving an unmanageable eigenproblem when extremely high45;dimensional descriptors are used. To overcome the difficulty we consider the column45;sampling technique and presume a special form of rotation matrix to facilitate subproblem decomposition. We test our method on several challenging image datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing with state45;of45;the45;art binary coding techniques.
