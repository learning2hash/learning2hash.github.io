Intuitively, if two strings \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are sufficiently similar and we
already have an FM-index for \(S_1\) then, by storing a little extra information,
we should be able to reuse parts of that index in an FM-index for \(S_2\). We
formalize this intuition and show that it can lead to significant space savings
in practice, as well as to some interesting theoretical problems.
