Codes in finite projective spaces equipped with the subspace distance have
been proposed for error control in random linear network coding. Here we
collect the present knowledge on lower and upper bounds for binary subspace
codes for projective dimensions of at most \(7\). We obtain several improvements
of the bounds and perform two classifications of optimal subspace codes, which
are unknown so far in the literature.
