Reusing published datasets on the Web is of great interest to researchers and
developers. Their data needs may be met by submitting queries to a dataset
search engine to retrieve relevant datasets. In this ongoing work towards
developing a more usable dataset search engine, we characterize real data needs
by annotating the semantics of 1,947 queries using a novel fine-grained scheme,
to provide implications for enhancing dataset search. Based on the findings, we
present a query-centered framework for dataset search, and explore the
implementation of snippet generation and evaluate it with a preliminary user
study.
