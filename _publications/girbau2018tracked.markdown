In this work we propose tracking as a generic addition to the instance search
task. From video data perspective, much information that can be used is not
taken into account in the traditional instance search approach. This work aims
to provide insights on exploiting such existing information by means of
tracking and the proper combination of the results, independently of the
instance search system. We also present a study on the improvement of the
system when using multiple independent instances (up to 4) of the same person.
Experimental results show that our system improves substantially its
performance when using tracking. Best configuration improves from mAP = 0.447
to mAP = 0.511 for a single example, and from mAP = 0.647 to mAP = 0.704 for
multiple (4) given examples.
