This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to enhance
datasets and improve irony detection in 19th-century Latin American newspapers.
Two strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of BERT and GPT-4o models
in capturing the subtle nuances nature of irony, through both multi-class and
binary classification tasks. First, we implemented dataset enhancements focused
on enriching emotional and contextual cues; however, these showed limited
impact on historical language analysis. The second strategy, a semi-automated
annotation process, effectively addressed class imbalance and augmented the
dataset with high-quality annotations. Despite the challenges posed by the
complexity of irony, this work contributes to the advancement of sentiment
analysis through two key contributions: introducing a new historical Spanish
dataset tagged for sentiment analysis and irony detection, and proposing a
semi-automated annotation methodology where human expertise is crucial for
refining LLMs results, enriched by incorporating historical and cultural
contexts as core features.
