The Large-Scale Pedestrian Retrieval Competition (LSPRC) mainly focuses on
person retrieval which is an important end application in intelligent vision
system of surveillance. Person retrieval aims at searching the interested
target with specific visual attributes or images. The low image quality,
various camera viewpoints, large pose variations and occlusions in real scenes
make it a challenge problem. By providing large-scale surveillance data in real
scene and standard evaluation methods that are closer to real application, the
competition aims to improve the robust of related algorithms and further meet
the complicated situations in real application. LSPRC includes two kinds of
tasks, i.e., Attribute based Pedestrian Retrieval (PR-A) and Re-IDentification
(ReID) based Pedestrian Retrieval (PR-ID). The normal evaluation index, i.e.,
mean Average Precision (mAP), is used to measure the performances of the two
tasks under various scale, pose and occlusion. While the method of system
evaluation is introduced to evaluate the person retrieval system in which the
related algorithms of the two tasks are integrated into a large-scale video
parsing platform (named ISEE) combing with algorithm of pedestrian detection.
