This paper explores a fully unsupervised deep learning approach for computing
distance-preserving maps that generate low-dimensional embeddings for a certain
class of manifolds. We use the Siamese configuration to train a neural network
to solve the problem of least squares multidimensional scaling for generating
maps that approximately preserve geodesic distances. By training with only a
few landmarks, we show a significantly improved local and nonlocal
generalization of the isometric mapping as compared to analogous non-parametric
counterparts. Importantly, the combination of a deep-learning framework with a
multidimensional scaling objective enables a numerical analysis of network
architectures to aid in understanding their representation power. This provides
a geometric perspective to the generalizability of deep learning.
