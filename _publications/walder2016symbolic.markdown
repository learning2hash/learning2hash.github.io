In this document, we introduce a new dataset designed for training machine
learning models of symbolic music data. Five datasets are provided, one of
which is from a newly collected corpus of 20K midi files. We describe our
preprocessing and cleaning pipeline, which includes the exclusion of a number
of files based on scores from a previously developed probabilistic machine
learning model. We also define training, testing and validation splits for the
new dataset, based on a clustering scheme which we also describe. Some simple
histograms are included.
