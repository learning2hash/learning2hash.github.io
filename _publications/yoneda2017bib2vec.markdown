We propose a novel embedding model that represents relationships among
several elements in bibliographic information with high representation ability
and flexibility. Based on this model, we present a novel search system that
shows the relationships among the elements in the ACL Anthology Reference
Corpus. The evaluation results show that our model can achieve a high
prediction ability and produce reasonable search results.
