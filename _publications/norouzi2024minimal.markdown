We propose a method for learning similaritypreserving hash functions that map highdimensional data onto binary codes. The formulation is based on structured prediction with latent variables and a hinge-like loss function. It is efficient to train for large datasets scales well to large code lengths and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
