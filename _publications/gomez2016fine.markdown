This paper focuses on the problem of script identification in unconstrained
scenarios. Script identification is an important prerequisite to recognition,
and an indispensable condition for automatic text understanding systems
designed for multi-language environments. Although widely studied for document
images and handwritten documents, it remains an almost unexplored territory for
scene text images.
  We detail a novel method for script identification in natural images that
combines convolutional features and the Naive-Bayes Nearest Neighbor
classifier. The proposed framework efficiently exploits the discriminative
power of small stroke-parts, in a fine-grained classification framework.
  In addition, we propose a new public benchmark dataset for the evaluation of
joint text detection and script identification in natural scenes. Experiments
done in this new dataset demonstrate that the proposed method yields state of
the art results, while it generalizes well to different datasets and variable
number of scripts. The evidence provided shows that multi-lingual scene text
recognition in the wild is a viable proposition. Source code of the proposed
method is made available online.
