The five-dollar model is a lightweight text-to-image generative architecture
that generates low dimensional images from an encoded text prompt. This model
can successfully generate accurate and aesthetically pleasing content in low
dimensional domains, with limited amounts of training data. Despite the small
size of both the model and datasets, the generated images are still able to
maintain the encoded semantic meaning of the textual prompt. We apply this
model to three small datasets: pixel art video game maps, video game sprite
images, and down-scaled emoji images and apply novel augmentation strategies to
improve the performance of our model on these limited datasets. We evaluate our
models performance using cosine similarity score between text-image pairs
generated by the CLIP VIT-B/32 model.
