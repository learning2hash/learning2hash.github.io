Clustering large amount of data is becoming increasingly important in the
current times. Due to the large sizes of data, clustering algorithm often take
too much time. Sampling this data before clustering is commonly used to reduce
this time. In this work, we propose a probabilistic sampling technique called
cube sampling along with K-Prototype clustering. Cube sampling is used because
of its accurate sample selection. K-Prototype is most frequently used
clustering algorithm when the data is numerical as well as categorical (very
common in today's time). The novelty of this work is in obtaining the crucial
inclusion probabilities for cube sampling using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA).
  Experiments on multiple datasets from the UCI repository demonstrate that
cube sampled K-Prototype algorithm gives the best clustering accuracy among
similarly sampled other popular clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical
Clustering (HC), Spectral Clustering (SC)). When compared with unsampled
K-Prototype, K-Means, HC and SC, it still has the best accuracy with the added
advantage of reduced computational complexity (due to reduced data size).
