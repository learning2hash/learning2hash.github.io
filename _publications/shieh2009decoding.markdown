A frequency permutation array (FPA) of length \(n=m\lambda\) and distance \(d\)
is a set of permutations on a multiset over \(m\) symbols, where each symbol
appears exactly \(\lambda\) times and the distance between any two elements in
the array is at least \(d\). FPA generalizes the notion of permutation array. In
this paper, under the distance metric \(\ell_\infty\)-norm, we first prove lower
and upper bounds on the size of FPA. Then we give a construction of FPA with
efficient encoding and decoding capabilities. Moreover, we show our design is
locally decodable, i.e., we can decode a message bit by reading at most
\(\lambda+1\) symbols, which has an interesting application for private
information retrieval.
