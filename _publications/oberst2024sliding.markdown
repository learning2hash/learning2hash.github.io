<p>With hash tables being one of the most used data structures, Lehmann,
Sanders and Walzer propose a novel, light-weight hash table, referred to
as Slick Hash. Their idea is to hit a sweet spot between space
consumption and speed. Building on the theoretical ideas by the authors,
an implementation and experiments are required to evaluate the practical
performance of Slick Hash. This work contributes to fulfilling this
requirement by providing a basic implementation of Slick Hash, an
analysis of its performance, and an evaluation of the entry deletion,
focusing on the impact of backyard cleaning. The findings are discussed,
and a conclusion is drawn.</p>
