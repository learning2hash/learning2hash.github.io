The review and analysis of large collections of documents and the periodic
monitoring of new additions thereto has greatly benefited from new developments
in computer software. This paper demonstrates how using random vectors to
construct a low-dimensional Euclidean space embedding words and documents
enables fast and accurate computation of semantic similarities between them.
With this technique of Semantic Technology-Assisted Review (STAR), documents
can be selected, compared, classified, summarized and evaluated very quickly
with minimal expert involvement and high-quality results.
