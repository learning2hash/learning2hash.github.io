The hull of a linear code is defined to be the intersection of the code and
its dual. When the size of the hull is small, it has been proved that some
algorithms for checking permutation equivalence of two linear codes and
computing the automorphism group of a linear code are very effective in
general. Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are codes meeting the Singleton
bound. Twisted Reed-Solomon codes is a generalization of Reed-Solomon codes,
which is also a nice construction for MDS codes. In this short letter, we
obtain some twisted Reed-Solomon MDS codes with one-dimensional hull. Moreover,
these codes are not monomially equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes.
