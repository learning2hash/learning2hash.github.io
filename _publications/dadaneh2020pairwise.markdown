Semantic hashing has become a crucial component of fast similarity search in many large45;scale information retrieval systems in particular for text data. Variational auto45;encoders (VAEs) with binary latent variables as hashing codes provide state45;of45;the45;art performance in terms of precision for document retrieval. We propose a pairwise loss function with discrete latent VAE to reward within45;class similarity and between45;class dissimilarity for supervised hashing. Instead of solving the optimization relying on existing biased gradient estimators an unbiased low45;variance gradient estimator is adopted to optimize the hashing function by evaluating the non45;differentiable loss function over two correlated sets of binary hashing codes to control the variance of gradient estimates. This new semantic hashing framework achieves superior performance compared to the state45;of45;the45;arts as demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments.
