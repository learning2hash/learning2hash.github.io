Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\chi\_\{\bar\{k\}\}(n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} be the number of colors required to color the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-dimensional hypercube such that no two vertices with the same color are at a distance at most \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. In other words, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\chi\_\{\bar\{k\}\}(n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is the minimum number of binary codes with minimum distance at least \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k+1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} required to partition the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-dimensional Hamming space. By giving an explicit coloring, it is shown that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\chi\_\{\bar\{2\}\}(8)=13\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
