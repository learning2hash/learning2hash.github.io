<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{\bar{k}}(n)\)</span> be the
number of colors required to color the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional hypercube such that no two
vertices with the same color are at a distance at most <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(\chi_{\bar{k}}(n)\)</span> is the minimum number
of binary codes with minimum distance at least <span
class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> required to partition the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional Hamming space. By giving an
explicit coloring, it is shown that <span
class="math inline">\(\chi_{\bar{2}}(8)=13\)</span>.</p>
