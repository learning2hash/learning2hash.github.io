Let (chi_(n)) be the number of colors required to color the (n)-dimensional hypercube such that no two vertices with the same color are at a distance at most (k). In other words (chi_(n)) is the minimum number of binary codes with minimum distance at least (k+1) required to partition the (n)-dimensional Hamming space. By giving an explicit coloring it is shown that (chi_(8)=13).
