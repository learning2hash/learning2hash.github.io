We propose a technique to improve the search efficiency of the bag-of-words
(BoW) method for image retrieval. We introduce a notion of difficulty for the
image matching problems and propose methods that reduce the amount of
computations required for the feature vector-quantization task in BoW by
exploiting the fact that easier queries need less computational resources.
Measuring the difficulty of a query and stopping the search accordingly is
formulated as a stopping problem. We introduce stopping rules that terminate
the image search depending on the difficulty of each query, thereby
significantly reducing the computational cost. Our experimental results show
the effectiveness of our approach when it is applied to appearance-based
localization problem.
