We study the duplication with transposition distance between strings of
length \(n\) over a \(q\)-ary alphabet and their roots. In other words, we
investigate the number of duplication operations of the form \(x = (abcd) \to y
= (abcbd)\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are strings and \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are their
substrings, needed to get a \(q\)-ary string of length \(n\) starting from the set
of strings without duplications. For exact duplication, we prove that the
maximal distance between a string of length at most \(n\) and its root has the
asymptotic order \(n/log n\). For approximate duplication, where a
\(\beta\)-fraction of symbols may be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the
maximal distance has a sharp transition from the order \(n/log n\) to \(log n\)
at \(\beta=(q-1)/q\). The motivation for this problem comes from genomics, where
such duplications represent a special kind of mutation and the distance between
a given biological sequence and its root is the smallest number of
transposition mutations required to generate the sequence.
