Online signature verification (OSV) is one of the most challenging tasks in
writer identification and digital forensics. Owing to the large
intra-individual variability, there is a critical requirement to accurately
learn the intra-personal variations of the signature to achieve higher
classification accuracy. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose an OSV
framework based on deep convolutional Siamese network (DCSN). DCSN
automatically extracts robust feature descriptions based on metric-based loss
function which decreases intra-writer variability (Genuine-Genuine) and
increases inter-individual variability (Genuine-Forgery) and directs the DCSN
for effective discriminative representation learning for online signatures and
extend it for one shot learning framework. Comprehensive experimentation
conducted on three widely accepted benchmark datasets MCYT-100 (DB1), MCYT-330
(DB2) and SVC-2004-Task2 demonstrate the capability of our framework to
distinguish the genuine and forgery samples. Experimental results confirm the
efficiency of deep convolutional Siamese network based OSV by achieving a lower
error rate as compared to many recent and state-of-the art OSV techniques.
