Fashion recommendation is often declined as the task of finding complementary
items given a query garment or retrieving outfits that are suitable for a given
user. In this work we address the problem by adding an additional semantic
layer based on the style of the proposed dressing. We model style according to
two important aspects: the mood and the emotion concealed behind color
combination patterns and the appropriateness of the retrieved garments for a
given type of social event. To address the former we rely on Shigenobu
Kobayashi's color image scale, which associated emotional patterns and moods to
color triples. The latter instead is analyzed by extracting garments from
images of social events. Overall, we integrate in a state of the art garment
recommendation framework a style classifier and an event classifier in order to
condition recommendation on a given query.
