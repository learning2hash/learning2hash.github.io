In this work we create a question answering dataset over the DBLP scholarly
knowledge graph (KG). DBLP is an on-line reference for bibliographic
information on major computer science publications that indexes over 4.4
million publications published by more than 2.2 million authors. Our dataset
consists of 10,000 question answer pairs with the corresponding SPARQL queries
which can be executed over the DBLP KG to fetch the correct answer. DBLP-QuAD
is the largest scholarly question answering dataset.
