In an automated search system, similarity is a key concept in solving a human
task. Indeed, human process is usually a natural categorization that underlies
many natural abilities such as image recovery, language comprehension, decision
making, or pattern recognition. In the image search axis, there are several
ways to measure the similarity between images in an image database, to a query
image. Image search by content is based on the similarity of the visual
characteristics of the images. The distance function used to evaluate the
similarity between images depends on the criteria of the search but also on the
representation of the characteristics of the image; this is the main idea of
the near and fuzzy sets approaches. In this article, we introduce a new
category of beta type-2 fuzzy sets for the description of image characteristics
as well as the near sets approach for image recovery. Finally, we illustrate
our work with examples of image recovery problems used in the real world.
