Discovering significant itemsets is one of the fundamental problems in data
mining. It has recently been shown that constraint programming is a flexible
way to tackle data mining tasks. With a constraint programming approach, we can
easily express and efficiently answer queries with users constraints on items.
However, in many practical cases it is possible that queries also express users
constraints on the dataset itself. For instance, asking for a particular
itemset in a particular part of the dataset. This paper presents a general
constraint programming model able to handle any kind of query on the items or
the dataset for itemset mining.
