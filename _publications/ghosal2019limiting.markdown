We study the asymptotic speed of a second class particle in the two-species
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on \(\mathbb\{Z\}\) with each particle
belonging either to the first class or the second class. For any fixed
non-negative integer \(L\), we consider the two-species ASEP started from the
initial data with all the sites of \(\mathbb\{Z\}_\{<-L\}\) occupied by first class
particles, all the sites of \(\mathbb\{Z\}_\{[-L,0]\}\) occupied by second class
particles, and the rest of the sites of \(\mathbb\{Z\}\) unoccupied. With these
initial conditions, we show that the speed of the leftmost second class
particle converges weakly to a distribution supported on a symmetric compact
interval \(\Gamma\subset \mathbb\{R\}\). Furthermore, the limiting distribution is
shown to have the same law as the minimum of \(L+1\) independent random samples
drawn uniformly from the interval \(\Gamma\).
