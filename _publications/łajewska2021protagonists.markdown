Semantic annotation of long texts, such as novels, remains an open challenge
in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This research investigates the problem of
detecting person entities and assigning them unique identities, i.e.,
recognizing people (especially main characters) in novels. We prepared a method
for person entity linkage (named entity recognition and disambiguation) and new
testing datasets. The datasets comprise 1,300 sentences from 13 classic novels
of different genres that a novel reader had manually annotated. Our process of
identifying literary characters in a text, implemented in protagonistTagger,
comprises two stages: (1) named entity recognition (NER) of persons, (2) named
entity disambiguation (NED) - matching each recognized person with the literary
character's full name, based on approximate text matching. The
protagonistTagger achieves both precision and recall of above 83% on the
prepared testing sets. Finally, we gathered a corpus of 13 full-text novels
tagged with protagonistTagger that comprises more than 35,000 mentions of
literary characters.
