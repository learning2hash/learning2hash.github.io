Internet search engines have become an integral part of life, but for pop
music, people still rely on textual search engines like Google. We propose Pied
piper, a meta search engine for music. It can search for music lyrics, song
metadata and song audio or a combination of any of these as the input query and
efficiently return the relevant results.
