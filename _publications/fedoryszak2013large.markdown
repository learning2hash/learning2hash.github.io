During the process of citation matching links from bibliography entries to
referenced publications are created. Such links are indicators of topical
similarity between linked texts, are used in assessing the impact of the
referenced document and improve navigation in the user interfaces of digital
libraries. In this paper we present a citation matching method and show how to
scale it up to handle great amounts of data using appropriate indexing and a
MapReduce paradigm in the Hadoop environment.
