Perceptual image hashing methods are often applied in various objectives such as image retrieval finding duplicate or near45;duplicate images and finding similar images from large45;scale image content. The main challenge in image hashing techniques is robust feature extraction which generates the same or similar hashes in images that are visually identical. In this article we present a short review of the state45;of45;the45;art traditional perceptual hashing and deep learning45;based perceptual hashing methods identifying the best approaches.
