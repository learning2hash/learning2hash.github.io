We prove a Berry-Esseen theorem, a local central limit theorem and (local)
large and (global) moderate deviations principles for i.i.d. (uniformly) random
non-uniformly expanding or hyperbolic maps with exponential first return times.
  Using existing results the problem is reduced to certain random (Young) tower
extensions, which is the main focus of this paper. On the random towers we will
obtain our results using contraction properties of random complex equivariant
cones with respect to the complex Hilbert projective metric.
