Recommender systems are needed to find food items of ones interest. We review
recommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food
personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes
framework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term
extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and
standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the
performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general
outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy,
precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure
than existing semantic recommenders.
