In this paper, we study high-dimensional random projections of
\(\ell_p^n\)-balls. More precisely, for any \(n\in\mathbb N\) let \(E_n\) be a random
subspace of dimension \(k_n\in\\{1,\ldots,n\\}\) and \(X_n\) be a random point in the
unit ball of \(\ell_p^n\). Our work provides a description of the Gaussian
fluctuations of the Euclidean norm \(\|P_\{E_n\}X_n\|_2\) of random orthogonal
projections of \(X_n\) onto \(E_n\). In particular, under the condition that
\(k_n\to\infty\) it is shown that these random variables satisfy a central limit
theorem, as the space dimension \(n\) tends to infinity. Moreover, if
\(k_n\to\infty\) fast enough, we provide a Berry-Esseen bound on the rate of
convergence in the central limit theorem. At the end we provide a discussion of
the large deviations counterpart to our central limit theorem.
