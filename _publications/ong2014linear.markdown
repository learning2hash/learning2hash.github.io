We study zero-error unicast index-coding instances, where each receiver must
perfectly decode its requested message set, and the message sets requested by
any two receivers do not overlap. We show that for all these instances with up
to five receivers, linear index codes are optimal. Although this class contains
9847 non-isomorphic instances, by using our recent results and by properly
categorizing the instances based on their graphical representations, we need to
consider only 13 non-trivial instances to solve the entire class. This work
complements the result by Arbabjolfaei et al. (ISIT 2013), who derived the
capacity region of all unicast index-coding problems with up to five receivers
in the diminishing-error setup. They employed random-coding arguments, which
require infinitely-long messages. We consider the zero-error setup; our
approach uses graph theory and combinatorics, and does not require long
messages.
