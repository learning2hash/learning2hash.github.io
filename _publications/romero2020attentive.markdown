Although group convolutional networks are able to learn powerful
representations based on symmetry patterns, they lack explicit means to learn
meaningful relationships among them (e.g., relative positions and poses). In
this paper, we present attentive group equivariant convolutions, a
generalization of the group convolution, in which attention is applied during
the course of convolution to accentuate meaningful symmetry combinations and
suppress non-plausible, misleading ones. We indicate that prior work on visual
attention can be described as special cases of our proposed framework and show
empirically that our attentive group equivariant convolutional networks
consistently outperform conventional group convolutional networks on benchmark
image datasets. Simultaneously, we provide interpretability to the learned
concepts through the visualization of equivariant attention maps.
