In this brief note, we study the strong law of large numbers for random walks
in random scenery. Under the assumptions that the random scenery is
non-stationary and satisfies weakly dependent condition with an appropriate
rate, we establish strong law of large numbers for random walks in random
scenery. Our results extend the known results in the literature.
