We introduce the Northumberland Dolphin Dataset 2020 (NDD20), a challenging
image dataset annotated for both coarse and fine-grained instance segmentation
and categorisation. This dataset, the first release of the NDD, was created in
response to the rapid expansion of computer vision into conservation research
and the production of field-deployable systems suited to extreme environmental
conditions -- an area with few open source datasets. NDD20 contains a large
collection of above and below water images of two different dolphin species for
traditional coarse and fine-grained segmentation. All data contained in NDD20
was obtained via manual collection in the North Sea around the Northumberland
coastline, UK. We present experimentation using standard deep learning network
architecture trained using NDD20 and report baselines results.
