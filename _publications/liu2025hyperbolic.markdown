Hyperbolic spaces allow for more efficient modeling of complex, hierarchical
structures, which is particularly beneficial in tasks involving multi-modal
data. Although hyperbolic geometries have been proven effective for
language-image pre-training, their capabilities to unify language, image, and
3D Point Cloud modalities are under-explored. We extend the 3D Point Cloud
modality in hyperbolic multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Additionally, we
explore the entailment, modality gap, and alignment regularizers for learning
hierarchical 3D embeddings and facilitating the transfer of knowledge from both
Text and Image modalities. These regularizers enable the learning of
intra-modal hierarchy within each modality and inter-modal hierarchy across
text, 2D images, and 3D Point Clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed training strategy yields an outstanding 3D Point Cloud encoder, and
the obtained 3D Point Cloud hierarchical embeddings significantly improve
performance on various downstream tasks.
