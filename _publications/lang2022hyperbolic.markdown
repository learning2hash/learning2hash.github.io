Object detection, for the most part, has been formulated in the euclidean
space, where euclidean or spherical geodesic distances measure the similarity
of an image region to an object class prototype. In this work, we study whether
a hyperbolic geometry better matches the underlying structure of the object
classification space. We incorporate a hyperbolic classifier in two-stage,
keypoint-based, and transformer-based object detection architectures and
evaluate them on large-scale, long-tailed, and zero-shot object detection
benchmarks. In our extensive experimental evaluations, we observe categorical
class hierarchies emerging in the structure of the classification space,
resulting in lower classification errors and boosting the overall object
detection performance.
