Important ethical concerns arising from computer vision datasets of people
have been receiving significant attention, and a number of datasets have been
withdrawn as a result. To meet the academic need for people-centric datasets,
we propose an analytical framework to guide ethical evaluation of existing
datasets and to serve future dataset creators in avoiding missteps. Our work is
informed by a review and analysis of prior works and highlights where such
ethical challenges arise.
