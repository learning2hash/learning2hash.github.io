The Brownian separable permuton is a random probability measure on the unit
square, which was introduced by Bassino, Bouvel, F\'eray, Gerin, Pierrot (2016)
as the scaling limit of the diagram of the uniform separable permutation as
size grows to infinity. We show that, almost surely, the permuton is the
pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on the graph of a random measure-preserving
function associated to a Brownian excursion whose strict local minima are
decorated with i.i.d. signs. As a consequence, its support is almost surely
totally disconnected, has Hausdorff dimension one, and enjoys self-similarity
properties inherited from those of the Brownian excursion. The density function
of the averaged permuton is computed and a connection with the shuffling of the
Brownian continuum random tree is explored.
