Fashion-model pose is an important attribute in the fashion industry.
Creative directors, modeling production houses, and top photographers always
look for professional models able to pose. without the skill to correctly pose,
their chances of landing professional modeling employment are regrettably quite
little. There are occasions when models and photographers are unsure of the
best pose to strike while taking photographs. This research concentrates on
suggesting the fashion personnel a series of similar images based on the input
image. The image is segmented into different parts and similar images are
suggested for the user. This was achieved by calculating the color histogram of
the input image and applying the same for all the images in the dataset and
comparing the histograms. Synthetic images have become popular to avoid privacy
concerns and to overcome the high cost of photoshoots. Hence, this paper also
extends the work of generating synthetic images from the recommendation engine
using styleGAN to an extent.
