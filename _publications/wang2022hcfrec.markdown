The ever45;increasing data scale of user45;item interactions makes it challenging for an effective and efficient recommender system. Recently hash45;based collaborative filtering (Hash45;CF) approaches employ efficient Hamming distance of learned binary representations of users and items to accelerate recommendations. However Hash45;CF often faces two challenging problems i.e. optimization on discrete representations and preserving semantic information in learned representations. To address the above two challenges we propose HCFRec a novel Hash45;CF approach for effective and efficient recommendations. Specifically HCFRec not only innovatively introduces normalized flow to learn the optimal hash code by efficiently fit a proposed approximate mixture multivariate normal distribution a continuous but approximately discrete distribution but also deploys a cluster consistency preserving mechanism to preserve the semantic structure in representations for more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on six real45;world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our HCFRec compared to the state45;of45;art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
