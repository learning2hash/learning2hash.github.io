The booming vector manage system calls for feasible similarity hash function as a front45;end to perform similarity analysis. In this paper we make a systematical survey on the existent well45;known similarity hash functions to tease out the satisfied ones. We conclude that the similarity hash function MinHash and Nilsimsa can be directly marshaled into the pipeline of similarity analysis using vector manage system. After that we make a brief and empirical discussion on the performance drawbacks of the these functions and highlight MinHash the variant of SimHash and feature hashing are the best for vector management system for large45;scale similarity analysis.
