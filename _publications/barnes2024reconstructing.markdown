Let \(V\) be a set of \(n\) points in \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\), and suppose that the
distance between each pair of points is revealed independently with probability
\(p\). We study when this information is sufficient to reconstruct large subsets
of \(V\), up to isometry.
  Strong results for \(d=1\) have been obtained by Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Michel,
Powierski, and Scott. In this paper, we investigate higher dimensions, and show
that if \(p>n^\{-2/(d+4)\}\), then we can reconstruct almost all of \(V\) up to
isometry, with high probability. We do this by relating it to a polluted graph
bootstrap percolation result, for which we adapt the methods of Balogh,
Bollob\'as, and Morris.
