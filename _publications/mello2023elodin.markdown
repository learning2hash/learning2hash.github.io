Despite recent advancements, the field of text-to-image synthesis still
suffers from lack of fine-grained control. Using only text, it remains
challenging to deal with issues such as concept coherence and concept
contamination. We propose a method to enhance control by generating specific
concepts that can be reused throughout multiple images, effectively expanding
natural language with new words that can be combined much like a painter's
palette. Unlike previous contributions, our method does not copy visuals from
input data and can generate concepts through text alone. We perform a set of
comparisons that finds our method to be a significant improvement over
text-only prompts.
