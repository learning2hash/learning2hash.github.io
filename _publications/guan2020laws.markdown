As the extension of uncorrelated single-valued random variables, set-valued
case is studied in this paper. When the underlying space is of finite
dimension, by using the support function, We shall prove the weak and strong
laws of large numbers for uncorrelated set-valued random variables in the sense
of Hausdorff metric \(d_H\). Our results generalize weak and strong laws of large
numbers for independent identically distributed or independent set-valued
random variables.
