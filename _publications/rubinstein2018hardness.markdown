We prove conditional near-quadratic running time lower bounds for approximate Bichromatic Closest Pair with Euclidean, Manhattan, Hamming, or edit distance. Specifically, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false, for every \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta>0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} there exists a constant \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\epsilon>0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} such that computing a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((1+\epsilon)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-approximation to the Bichromatic Closest Pair requires \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n^\{2-\delta\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} time. In particular, this implies a near-linear query time for Approximate Nearest Neighbor search with polynomial preprocessing time. Our reduction uses the Distributed PCP framework of [ARW'17], but obtains improved efficiency using Algebraic Geometry (AG) codes. Efficient PCPs from AG codes have been constructed in other settings before [BKKMS'16, BCGRS'17], but our construction is the first to yield new hardness results.
