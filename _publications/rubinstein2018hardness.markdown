<p>We prove conditional near-quadratic running time lower bounds for
approximate Bichromatic Closest Pair with Euclidean, Manhattan, Hamming,
or edit distance. Specifically, unless the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) is false, for every <span
class="math inline">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> there exists a constant <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> such that computing a <span
class="math inline">\((1+\epsilon)\)</span>-approximation to the
Bichromatic Closest Pair requires <span
class="math inline">\(n^{2-\delta}\)</span> time. In particular, this
implies a near-linear query time for Approximate Nearest Neighbor search
with polynomial preprocessing time. Our reduction uses the Distributed
PCP framework of [ARW’17], but obtains improved efficiency using
Algebraic Geometry (AG) codes. Efficient PCPs from AG codes have been
constructed in other settings before [BKKMS’16, BCGRS’17], but our
construction is the first to yield new hardness results.</p>
