We have benchmarked the maximum obtainable recognition accuracy on various
word image datasets using manual segmentation and a currently available
commercial OCR. We have developed a Matlab program, with graphical user
interface, for semi-automated pixel level segmentation of word images. We
discuss the advantages of pixel level annotation. We have covered five
databases adding up to over 3600 word images. These word images have been
cropped from camera captured scene, born-digital and street view images. We
recognize the segmented word image using the trial version of Nuance Omnipage
OCR. We also discuss, how the degradations introduced during acquisition or
inaccuracies introduced during creation of word images affect the recognition
of the word present in the image. Word images for different kinds of
degradations and correction for slant and curvy nature of words are also
discussed. The word recognition rates obtained on ICDAR 2003, Sign evaluation,
Street view, Born-digital and ICDAR 2011 datasets are 83.9%, 89.3%, 79.6%,
88.5% and 86.7% respectively.
