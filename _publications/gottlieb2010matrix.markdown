We revisit the matrix problems sparse null space and matrix sparsification,
and show that they are equivalent. We then proceed to seek algorithms for these
problems: We prove the hardness of approximation of these problems, and also
give a powerful tool to extend algorithms and heuristics for sparse
approximation theory to these problems.
