Star glyphs are a well-researched visualization technique to represent
multi-dimensional data. They are often used in small multiple settings for a
visual comparison of many data points. However, their overall visual appearance
is strongly influenced by the ordering of dimensions. To this end, two
orthogonal categories of layout strategies are proposed in the literature:
order dimensions by similarity to get homogeneously shaped glyphs vs. order by
dissimilarity to emphasize spikes and salient shapes. While there is evidence
that salient shapes support clustering tasks, evaluation, and direct comparison
of data-driven ordering strategies has not received much research attention. We
contribute an empirical user study to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness,
and user confidence in visual clustering tasks using star glyphs. In comparison
to similarity-based ordering, our results indicate that dissimilarity-based
star glyph layouts support users better in clustering tasks, especially when
clutter is present.
