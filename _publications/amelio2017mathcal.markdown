This paper introduces a new (dis)similarity measure for 2D arrays, extending
the Average Common Submatrix measure. This is accomplished by: (i) considering
the frequency of matching patterns, (ii) restricting the pattern matching to a
fixed-size neighborhood, and (iii) computing a distance-based approximate
matching. This will achieve better performances with low execution time and
larger information retrieval.
