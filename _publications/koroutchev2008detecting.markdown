The purpose of this paper is to introduce an algorithm that can detect the
most unusual part of a digital image. The most unusual part of a given shape is
defined as a part of the image that has the maximal distance to all non
intersecting shapes with the same form.
  The method can be used to scan image databases with no clear model of the
interesting part or large image databases, as for example medical databases.
