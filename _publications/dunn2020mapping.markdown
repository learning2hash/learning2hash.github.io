This paper evaluates large georeferenced corpora, taken from both web-crawled
and social media sources, against ground-truth population and language-census
datasets. The goal is to determine (i) which dataset best represents population
demographics; (ii) in what parts of the world the datasets are most
representative of actual populations; and (iii) how to weight the datasets to
provide more accurate representations of underlying populations. The paper
finds that the two datasets represent very different populations and that they
correlate with actual populations with values of r=0.60 (social media) and
r=0.49 (web-crawled). Further, Twitter data makes better predictions about the
inventory of languages used in each country.
