We present WojoodNER-2024, the second Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Shared Task. In WojoodNER-2024, we focus on fine-grained Arabic NER. We
provided participants with a new Arabic fine-grained NER dataset called
wojoodfine, annotated with subtypes of entities. WojoodNER-2024 encompassed
three subtasks: (i) Closed-Track Flat Fine-Grained NER, (ii) Closed-Track
Nested Fine-Grained NER, and (iii) an Open-Track NER for the Israeli War on
Gaza. A total of 43 unique teams registered for this shared task. Five teams
participated in the Flat Fine-Grained Subtask, among which two teams tackled
the Nested Fine-Grained Subtask and one team participated in the Open-Track NER
Subtask. The winning teams achieved F-1 scores of 91% and 92% in the Flat
Fine-Grained and Nested Fine-Grained Subtasks, respectively. The sole team in
the Open-Track Subtask achieved an F-1 score of 73.7%.
