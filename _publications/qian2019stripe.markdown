Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) has been attracting increasing interest in
the field of computer vision due to the growing utilization of surveillance
cameras in public security. However, vehicle Re-ID still suffers a similarity
challenge despite the efforts made to solve this problem. This challenge
involves distinguishing different instances with nearly identical appearances.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-branch stripe-based and attribute-aware
deep convolutional neural network (SAN) to learn the efficient feature
embedding for vehicle Re-ID task. The two-branch neural network, consisting of
stripe-based branch and attribute-aware branches, can adaptively extract the
discriminative features from the visual appearance of vehicles. A horizontal
average pooling and dimension-reduced convolutional layers are inserted into
the stripe-based branch to achieve part-level features. Meanwhile, the
attribute-aware branch extracts the global feature under the supervision of
vehicle attribute labels to separate the similar vehicle identities with
different attribute annotations. Finally, the part-level and global features
are concatenated together to form the final descriptor of the input image for
vehicle Re-ID. The final descriptor not only can separate vehicles with
different attributes but also distinguish vehicle identities with the same
attributes. The extensive experiments on both VehicleID and VeRi databases show
that the proposed SAN method outperforms other state-of-the-art vehicle Re-ID
approaches.
