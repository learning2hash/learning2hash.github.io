Both Minskys society of mind and Schmidhubers learning to think inspire diverse societies of large multimodal neural networks (NNs) that solve problems by interviewing each other in a mindstorm. Recent implementations of NN-based societies of minds consist of large language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through a natural language interface. In doing so they overcome the limitations of single LLMs improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning. In these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs) new agents -- all communicating through the same universal symbolic language -- are easily added in a modular fashion. To demonstrate the power of NLSOMs we assemble and experiment with several of them (having up to 129 members) leveraging mindstorms in them to solve some practical AI tasks visual question answering image captioning text-to-image synthesis 3D generation egocentric retrieval embodied AI and general language-based task solving. We view this as a starting point towards much larger NLSOMs with billions of agents-some of which may be humans. And with this emergence of great societies of heterogeneous minds many new research questions have suddenly become paramount to the future of artificial intelligence. What should be the social structure of an NLSOM What would be the (dis)advantages of having a monarchical rather than a democratic structure How can principles of NN economies be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement learning NLSOM In this work we identify discuss and try to answer some of these questions.
