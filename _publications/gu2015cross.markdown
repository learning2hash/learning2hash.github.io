Learning a hashing function for cross-media search is very desirable due to
its low storage cost and fast query speed. However, the data crawled from
Internet cannot always guarantee good correspondence among different modalities
which affects the learning for hashing function. In this paper, we focus on
cross-modal hashing with partially corresponded data. The data without full
correspondence are made in use to enhance the hashing performance. The
experiments on Wiki and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrates that the proposed method
outperforms some state-of-the-art hashing approaches with fewer correspondence
information.
