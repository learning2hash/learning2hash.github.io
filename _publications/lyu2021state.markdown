\#StopAsianHate and \#StopAAPIHate are two of the most commonly used hashtags
that represent the current movement to end hate crimes against the Asian
American and Pacific Islander community. We conduct a social media study of
public opinion on the \#StopAsianHate and \#StopAAPIHate movement based on 46,058
Twitter users across 30 states in the United States ranging from March 18 to
April 11, 2021. The movement attracts more participation from women, younger
adults, Asian and Black communities. 51.56% of the Twitter users show direct
support, 18.38% are news about anti-Asian hate crimes, while 5.43% show a
negative attitude towards the movement. Public opinion varies across user
characteristics. Furthermore, among the states with most racial bias motivated
hate crimes, the negative attitude towards the \#StopAsianHate and \#StopAAPIHate
movement is the weakest. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale
social media-based study to understand public opinion on the \#StopAsianHate and
\#StopAAPIHate movement. We hope our study can provide insights and promote
research on anti-Asian hate crimes, and ultimately help address such a serious
societal issue for the common benefits of all communities.
