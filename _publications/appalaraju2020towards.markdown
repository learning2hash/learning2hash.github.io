Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the
last few years. More recently, contrastive instance learning has shown
impressive results compared to its supervised learning counterparts. However,
even with the ever increased interest in contrastive instance learning, it is
still largely unclear why these methods work so well. In this paper, we aim to
unravel some of the mysteries behind their success, which are the good
practices. Through an extensive empirical analysis, we hope to not only provide
insights but also lay out a set of best practices that led to the success of
recent work in self-supervised representation learning.
