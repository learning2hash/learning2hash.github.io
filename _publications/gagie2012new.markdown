We present several results about position heaps, a relatively new alternative
to suffix trees and suffix arrays. First, we show that, if we limit the maximum
length of patterns to be sought, then we can also limit the height of the heap
and reduce the worst-case cost of insertions and deletions. Second, we show how
to build a position heap in linear time independent of the size of the
alphabet. Third, we show how to augment a position heap such that it supports
access to the corresponding suffix array, and vice versa. Fourth, we introduce
a variant of a position heap that can be simulated efficiently by a compressed
suffix array with a linear number of extra bits.
