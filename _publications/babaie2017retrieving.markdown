The idea of Radon barcodes (RBC) has been introduced recently. In this paper we propose a content-based image retrieval approach for big datasets based on Radon barcodes. Our method (Single Projection Radon Barcode or SP-RBC) uses only a few Radon single projections for each image as global features that can serve as a basis for weak learners. This is our most important contribution in this work which improves the results of the RBC considerably. As a matter of fact only one projection of an image as short as a single SURF feature vector can already achieve acceptable results. Nevertheless using multiple projections in a long vector will not deliver anticipated improvements. To exploit the information inherent in each projection our method uses the outcome of each projection separately and then applies more precise local search on the small subset of retrieved images. We have tested our method using IRMA 2009 dataset a with 14400 x-ray images as part of imageCLEF initiative. Our approach leads to a substantial decrease in the error rate in comparison with other non-learning methods.
