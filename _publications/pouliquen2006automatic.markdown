Automatic annotation of documents with controlled vocabulary terms
(descriptors) from a conceptual thesaurus is not only useful for document
indexing and retrieval. The mapping of texts onto the same thesaurus
furthermore allows to establish links between similar documents. This is also a
substantial requirement of the Semantic Web. This paper presents an almost
language-independent system that maps documents written in different languages
onto the same multilingual conceptual thesaurus, EUROVOC. Conceptual thesauri
differ from Natural Language Thesauri in that they consist of relatively small
controlled lists of words or phrases with a rather abstract meaning. To
automatically identify which thesaurus descriptors describe the contents of a
document best, we developed a statistical, associative system that is trained
on texts that have previously been indexed manually. In addition to describing
the large number of empirically optimised parameters of the fully functional
application, we present the performance of the software according to a human
evaluation by professional indexers.
