Metric learning is a fundamental problem in computer vision whereby a model
is trained to learn a semantically useful embedding space via ranking losses.
Traditionally, the effectiveness of a ranking loss depends on the minibatch
size, and is, therefore, inherently limited by the memory constraints of the
underlying hardware. While simply accumulating the embeddings across
minibatches has proved useful (Wang et al. [2020]), we show that it is equally
important to ensure that the accumulated embeddings are up to date. In
particular, it is necessary to circumvent the representational drift between
the accumulated embeddings and the feature embeddings at the current training
iteration as the learnable parameters are being updated. In this paper, we
model representational drift as distribution misalignment and tackle it using
moment matching. The result is a simple method for updating the stored
embeddings to match the first and second moments of the current embeddings at
each training iteration. Experiments on three popular image retrieval datasets,
namely, SOP, In-Shop, and DeepFashion2, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the performance in all scenarios.
