Computer vision techniques have attracted a great interest in precision
agriculture, recently. The common goal of all computer vision-based precision
agriculture tasks is to detect the objects of interest (e.g., crop, weed) and
discriminating them from the background. The Weeds are unwanted plants growing
among crops competing for nutrients, water, and sunlight, causing losses to
crop yields. Weed detection and mapping is critical for site-specific weed
management to reduce the cost of labor and impact of herbicides. This paper
investigates the use of color and texture features for discrimination of
Soybean crops and weeds. Feature extraction methods including two color spaces
(RGB, HSV), gray level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) are used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The
experiment was carried out on image dataset of soybean crop, obtained from an
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is publicly available. The results from
the experiment showed that the highest accuracy (above 96%) was obtained from
the combination of color and LBP features.
