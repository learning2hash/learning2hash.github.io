Compact directed acyclic word graphs (CDAWGs) [Blumer et al. 1987] are a
fundamental data structure on strings with applications in text pattern
searching, data compression, and pattern discovery. Intuitively, the CDAWG of a
string \(T\) is obtained by merging isomorphic subtrees of the suffix tree
[Weiner 1973] of the same string \(T\), and thus CDAWGs are a compact indexing
structure. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of CDAWGs when a
single character edit operation is performed at an arbitrary position in \(T\).
We show that the size of the CDAWG after an edit operation on \(T\) is
asymptotically at most 8 times larger than the original CDAWG before the edit.
