As a basic task of computer vision, image similarity retrieval is facing the
challenge of large-scale data and image copy attacks. This paper presents our
3rd place solution to the matching track of Image Similarity Challenge (ISC)
2021 organized by Facebook AI. We propose a multi-branch retrieval method of
combining global descriptors and local descriptors to cover all attack cases.
Specifically, we attempt many strategies to optimize global descriptors,
including abundant data augmentations, self-supervised learning with a single
Transformer model, overlay detection preprocessing. Moreover, we introduce the
robust SIFT feature and GPU Faiss for local retrieval which makes up for the
shortcomings of the global retrieval. Finally, KNN-matching algorithm is used
to judge the match and merge scores. We show some ablation experiments of our
method, which reveals the complementary advantages of global and local
features.
