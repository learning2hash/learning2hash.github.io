This work studies deep metric learning under small to medium scale data as we
believe that better generalization could be a contributing factor to the
improvement of previous fine-grained image retrieval methods; it should be
considered when designing future techniques. In particular, we investigate
using other layers in a deep metric learning system (besides the embedding
layer) for feature extraction and analyze how well they perform on training
data and generalize to testing data. From this study, we suggest a new
regularization practice where one can add or choose a more optimal layer for
feature extraction. State-of-the-art performance is demonstrated on 3
fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks: Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford
Online Product.
