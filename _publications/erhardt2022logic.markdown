Logic Mill is a scalable and openly accessible software system that
identifies semantically similar documents within either one domain-specific
corpus or multi-domain corpora. It uses advanced Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to generate numerical representations of documents. Currently
it leverages a large pre-trained language model to generate these document
representations. The system focuses on scientific publications and patent
documents and contains more than 200 million documents. It is easily accessible
via a simple Application Programming Interface (API) or via a web interface.
Moreover, it is continuously being updated and can be extended to text corpora
from other domains. We see this system as a general-purpose tool for future
research applications in the social sciences and other domains.
