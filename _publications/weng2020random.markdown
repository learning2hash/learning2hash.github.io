Image hash algorithms generate compact binary representations that can be quickly matched by Hamming distance thus become an efficient solution for large45;scale image retrieval. This paper proposes RV45;SSDH a deep image hash algorithm that incorporates the classical VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) architecture into neural networks. Specifically a novel neural network component is formed by coupling a random VLAD layer with a latent hash layer through a transform layer. This component can be combined with convolutional layers to realize a hash algorithm. We implement RV45;SSDH as a point45;wise algorithm that can be efficiently trained by minimizing classification error and quantization loss. Comprehensive experiments show this new architecture significantly outperforms baselines such as NetVLAD and SSDH and offers a cost45;effective trade45;off in the state45;of45;the45;art. In addition the proposed random VLAD layer leads to satisfactory accuracy with low complexity thus shows promising potentials as an alternative to NetVLAD.
