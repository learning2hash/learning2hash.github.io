For \\(s\\) \\(>\\) 0, we consider an algorithm that computes all \\(s\\)-well separated
pairs in certain point sets in \\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{n\}\\), \\(n\\) \\(>1\\). For an integer \\(K\\)
\\(>1\\), we also consider an algorithm that is a permutation of Dijkstra's
algorithm, that computes \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors using a certain power weighted
shortest path metric in \\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{n\}\\), \\(n\\) \\(>\\) \\(1\\). We describe each
algorithm and their respective dependencies on the input data. We introduce a
way to combine both algorithms into a fused algorithm. Several open problems
are given for future research.
