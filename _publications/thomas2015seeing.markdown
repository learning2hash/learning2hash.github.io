We introduce the novel problem of identifying the photographer behind a
photograph. To explore the feasibility of current computer vision techniques to
address this problem, we created a new dataset of over 180,000 images taken by
41 well-known photographers. Using this dataset, we examined the effectiveness
of a variety of features (low and high-level, including CNN features) at
identifying the photographer. We also trained a new deep convolutional neural
network for this task. Our results show that high-level features greatly
outperform low-level features. We provide qualitative results using these
learned models that give insight into our method's ability to distinguish
between photographers, and allow us to draw interesting conclusions about what
specific photographers shoot. We also demonstrate two applications of our
method.
