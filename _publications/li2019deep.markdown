Traditional person re45;identification (ReID) methods typically represent person images as real45;valued features which makes ReID inefficient when the gallery set is extremely large. Recently some hashing methods have been proposed to make ReID more efficient. However these hashing methods will deteriorate the accuracy in general and the efficiency of them is still not high enough. In this paper we propose a novel hashing method called deep multi45;index hashing (DMIH) to improve both efficiency and accuracy for ReID. DMIH seamlessly integrates multi45;index hashing and multi45;branch based networks into the same framework. Furthermore a novel block45;wise multi45;index hashing table construction approach and a search45;aware multi45;index (SAMI) loss are proposed in DMIH to improve the search efficiency. Experiments on three widely used datasets show that DMIH can outperform other state45;of45;the45;art baselines including both hashing methods and real45;valued methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
