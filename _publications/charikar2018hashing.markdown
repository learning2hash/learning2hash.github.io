Given a set of points (Psubset ^d) and a kernel (k) the Kernel Density Estimate at a point (xin^d) is defined as (_P(x)=Psum_yin P k(xy)). We study the problem of designing a data structure that given a data set (P) and a kernel function returns approximations to the kernel density of a query point in sublinear time. We introduce a class of unbiased estimators for kernel density implemented through locality-sensitive hashing and give general theorems bounding the variance of such estimators. These estimators give rise to efficient data structures for estimating the kernel density in high dimensions for a variety of commonly used kernels. Our work is the first to provide data-structures with theoretical guarantees that improve upon simple random sampling in high dimensions.
