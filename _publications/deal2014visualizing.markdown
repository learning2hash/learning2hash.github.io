Data visualizations can greatly enhance search in digital collections by
providing information about the scope and context of a collection and allowing
users to more easily browse and explore the contents. This article discusses
the benefits of incorporating visualizations into digital collections based on
the experiences of the Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) in
developing a user-friendly tool for searching and visualizing the project's
complex set of historical documents. The paper concludes with a tutorial on
using the free Library of Congress tool Viewshare to create visualizations
based on real data from the CWIHP Digital Archive.
