We report the findings of the second Complex Word Identification (CWI) shared
task organized as part of the BEA workshop co-located with NAACL-HLT'2018. The
second CWI shared task featured multilingual and multi-genre datasets divided
into four tracks: English monolingual, German monolingual, Spanish monolingual,
and a multilingual track with a French test set, and two tasks: binary
classification and probabilistic classification. A total of 12 teams submitted
their results in different task/track combinations and 11 of them wrote system
description papers that are referred to in this report and appear in the BEA
workshop proceedings.
