This paper presents Nabra, a corpora of Syrian Arabic dialects with
morphological annotations. A team of Syrian natives collected more than 6K
sentences containing about 60K words from several sources including social
media posts, scripts of movies and series, lyrics of songs and local proverbs
to build Nabra. Nabra covers several local Syrian dialects including those of
Aleppo, Damascus, Deir-ezzur, Hama, Homs, Huran, Latakia, Mardin, Raqqah, and
Suwayda. A team of nine annotators annotated the 60K tokens with full
morphological annotations across sentence contexts. We trained the annotators
to follow methodological annotation guidelines to ensure unique morpheme
annotations, and normalized the annotations. F1 and kappa agreement scores
ranged between 74% and 98% across features, showing the excellent quality of
Nabra annotations. Our corpora are open-source and publicly available as part
of the Currasat portal https://sina.birzeit.edu/currasat.
