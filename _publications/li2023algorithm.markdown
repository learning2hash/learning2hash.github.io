In this note, we first introduce a new problem called the longest common
subsequence and substring problem. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two strings over an
alphabet \(\Sigma\). The longest common subsequence and substring problem for \(X\)
and \(Y\) is to find the longest string which is a subsequence of \(X\) and a
substring of \(Y\). We propose an algorithm to solve the problem.
