In this work the \\(\ell_q\\)-norms of points chosen uniformly at random in a
centered regular simplex in high dimensions are studied. Berry-Esseen bounds in
the regime \\(1\leq q < \infty\\) are derived and complemented by a non-central
limit theorem together with moderate and large deviations in the case where
\\(q=\infty\\). A comparison with corresponding results for \\(\ell_p^n\\)-balls is
carried out as well.
