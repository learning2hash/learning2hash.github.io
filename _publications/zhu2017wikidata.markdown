Wikidata is the new, large-scale knowledge base of the Wikimedia Foundation.
As it can be edited by anyone, entries frequently get vandalized, leading to
the possibility that it might spread of falsified information if such posts are
not detected. The WSDM 2017 Wiki Vandalism Detection Challenge requires us to
solve this problem by computing a vandalism score denoting the likelihood that
a revision corresponds to an act of vandalism and performance is measured using
the ROC-AUC obtained on a held-out test set. This paper provides the details of
our submission that obtained an ROC-AUC score of 0.91976 in the final
evaluation.
