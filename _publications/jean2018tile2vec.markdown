Geospatial analysis lacks methods like the word vector representations and
pre-trained networks that significantly boost performance across a wide range
of natural language and computer vision tasks. To fill this gap, we introduce
Tile2Vec, an unsupervised representation learning algorithm that extends the
distributional hypothesis from natural language -- words appearing in similar
contexts tend to have similar meanings -- to spatially distributed data. We
demonstrate empirically that Tile2Vec learns semantically meaningful
representations on three datasets. Our learned representations significantly
improve performance in downstream classification tasks and, similar to word
vectors, visual analogies can be obtained via simple arithmetic in the latent
space.
