We study the intersecting family process initially studied in \cite\{BCFMR\}.
Here \(k=k(n)\) and \(E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_m\) is a random sequence of \(k\)-sets from
\(\binom\{[n]\}\{k\}\) where \(E_\{r+1\}\) is uniformly chosen from those \(k\)-sets that
are not already chosen and that meet \(E_i,i=1,2,\ldots,r\). We prove some new
results for the case where \(k=cn^\{1/3\}\) and for the case where \(k\gg n^\{1/2\}\).
