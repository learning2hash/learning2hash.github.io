We approach the problem of hotel recognition with deep metric learning. We
overview the existing approaches and propose a modification to Contrastive loss
called Contrastive-Triplet loss. We construct a robust pipeline for
benchmarking metric learning models and perform experiments on Hotels-50K and
CUB200 datasets. Contrastive-Triplet loss is shown to achieve better retrieval
on Hotels-50k. We open-source our code.
