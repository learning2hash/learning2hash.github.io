Let \(W(t)\), \(0\leq t\leq T\), be a Brownian motion in \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\), \(d=2,3\).
We say that \(x\) is a cut point for \(W\) if \(x=W(t)\) for some \(t\in(0,T)\) such
that \(W [0,t) \) and \(W (t,T]\) are disjoint. In this work, we prove that a.s.
the Minkowski content of the set of cut points for \(W\) exists and is finite and
non-trivial.
