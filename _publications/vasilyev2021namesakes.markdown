We present Namesakes, a dataset of ambiguously named entities obtained from
English-language Wikipedia and news articles. It consists of 58862 mentions of
4148 unique entities and their namesakes: 1000 mentions from news, 28843 from
Wikipedia articles about the entity, and 29019 Wikipedia backlink mentions.
Namesakes should be helpful in establishing challenging benchmarks for the task
of named entity linking (NEL).
