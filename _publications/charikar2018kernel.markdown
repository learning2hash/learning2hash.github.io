Given a set of points P⊂ R^123;d125; and a kernel k the Kernel Density Estimate at a point xinR^123;d125; is defined as mathrm123;KDE125;95;123;P125;(x)=frac123;1125;123;P125;∑95;123;yin P125; k(xy). We study the problem of designing a data structure that given a data set P and a kernel function returns approximations to the kernel density of a query point in sublinear time. We introduce a class of unbiased estimators for kernel density implemented through locality45;sensitive hashing and give general theorems bounding the variance of such estimators. These estimators give rise to efficient data structures for estimating the kernel density in high dimensions for a variety of commonly used kernels. Our work is the first to provide data45;structures with theoretical guarantees that improve upon simple random sampling in high dimensions.
