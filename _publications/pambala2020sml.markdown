The significant amount of training data required for training Convolutional
Neural Networks has become a bottleneck for applications like semantic
segmentation. Few-shot semantic segmentation algorithms address this problem,
with an aim to achieve good performance in the low-data regime, with few
annotated training images. Recently, approaches based on class-prototypes
computed from available training data have achieved immense success for this
task. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, Semantic
Meta-Learning (SML) which incorporates class level semantic descriptions in the
generated prototypes for this problem. In addition, we propose to use the well
established technique, ridge regression, to not only bring in the class-level
semantic information, but also to effectively utilise the information available
from multiple images present in the training data for prototype computation.
This has a simple closed-form solution, and thus can be implemented easily and
efficiently. Extensive experiments on the benchmark PASCAL-5i dataset under
different experimental settings show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework.
