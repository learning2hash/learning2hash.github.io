We present in this paper a cryptocurrency called Mobile Fungible Token (MFT)
or "MiftyCoin", which is mined with Proof of Human Work (PoH). Blocks in MFT's
blockchain are mined by users solving unique 24-tile puzzles autogenerated as a
function of block hash values. Each tile in the puzzle is a 4-sided domino-like
square, where the number of dots per square is a function of a subset of the
bits of a corresponding byte in the block's hash value. The objective is to
find a set of tile moves that end up in an arrangement with an optimal score;
where each matching tile side increases the score by one. The block with the
highest score gets a reward. More information about MiftyCoin is available at:
