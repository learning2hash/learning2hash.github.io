Steganography has proven to be one of the practical way of securing data. It
is a new kind of secret communication used to hide secret data inside other
innocent digital mediums. There are various algorithms for pair and matching
technique. One such method uses two bits of secret message to be matched with
cover image bits. Algorithm had used only 2 pairs to be mapped. Thus limiting
the matching to 6 bits per pixel. Here in our proposed algorithm we are
matching 3 bits at a time. Thus in the best case scenario we can match up to 9
bits per pixel. It is also a good foundation to build more secure communication
in today s data centric world.
