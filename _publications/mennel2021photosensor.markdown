Pixel binning is a technique, widely used in optical image acquisition and
spectroscopy, in which adjacent detector elements of an image sensor are
combined into larger pixels. This reduces the amount of data to be processed as
well as the impact of noise, but comes at the cost of a loss of information.
Here, we push the concept of binning to its limit by combining a large fraction
of the sensor elements into a single superpixel that extends over the whole
face of the chip. For a given pattern recognition task, its optimal shape is
determined from training data using a machine learning algorithm. We
demonstrate the classification of optically projected images from the MNIST
dataset on a nanosecond timescale, with enhanced sensitivity and without loss
of classification accuracy. Our concept is not limited to imaging alone but can
also be applied in optical spectroscopy or other sensing applications.
