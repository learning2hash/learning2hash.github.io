A code \(C\) is called \(\mathbb\{Z\}_p\mathbb\{Z\}_\{p^2\}\)-linear if it is the Gray
image of a \(\mathbb\{Z\}_p\mathbb\{Z\}_\{p^2\}\)-additive code. For any prime number
\(p\) larger than \(3\), the bounds of the rank of
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_p\mathbb\{Z\}_\{p^2\}\)-linear codes are given. For each value of the
rank and the pairs of rank and the dimension of the kernel of
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_p\mathbb\{Z\}_\{p^2\}\)-linear codes, we give detailed construction of
the corresponding codes. Finally, as an example, the rank and the dimension of
the kernel of \(\mathbb\{Z\}_5\mathbb\{Z\}_\{25\}\)-linear codes are studied.
