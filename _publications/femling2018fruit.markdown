This paper describes an approach of creating a system identifying fruit and
vegetables in the retail market using images captured with a video camera
attached to the system. The system helps the customers to label desired fruits
and vegetables with a price according to its weight. The purpose of the system
is to minimize the number of human computer interactions, speed up the
identification process and improve the usability of the graphical user
interface compared to existing manual systems. The hardware of the system is
constituted by a Raspberry Pi, camera, display, load cell and a case. To
classify an object, different convolutional neural networks have been tested
and retrained. To test the usability, a heuristic evaluation has been performed
with several users, concluding that the implemented system is more user
friendly compared to existing systems.
