We propose a family of near-metrics based on local graph diffusion to capture
similarity for a wide class of data sets. These quasi-metametrics, as their
names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces,
specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data
points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively.
The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its
reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features.
By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for
categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and
text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare
and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific
application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for
structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics
corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of
the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and
images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived
from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit
outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.
