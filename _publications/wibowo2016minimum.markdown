In this work, a new way to represent Japanese animation (anime) is presented.
We applied a minimum spanning tree to show the relation between anime. The
distance between anime is calculated through three similarity measurements,
namely crew, score histogram, and topic similarities. Finally, the centralities
are also computed to reveal the most significance anime. The result shows that
the minimum spanning tree can be used to determine the similarity anime.
Furthermore, by using centralities calculation, we found some anime that are
significant to others.
