The one-shot approach, DeepMark, for fast clothing detection as a
modification of a multi-target network, CenterNet, is proposed in the paper.
The state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.723 mAP for bounding box detection task and
0.532 mAP for landmark detection task on the DeepFashion2 Challenge dataset
were achieved. The proposed architecture can be used effectively on the
low-power devices.
