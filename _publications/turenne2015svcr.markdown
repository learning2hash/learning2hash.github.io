<p>We present a new R package which takes a numerical matrix format as
data input, and computes clusters using a support vector clustering
method (SVC). We have implemented an original 2D-grid labeling approach
to speed up cluster extraction. In this sense, SVC can be seen as an
efficient cluster extraction if clusters are separable in a 2-D map.
Secondly we showed that this SVC approach using a Jaccard-Radial base
kernel can help to classify well enough a set of terms into ontological
classes and help to define regular expression rules for information
extraction in documents; our case study concerns a set of terms and
documents about developmental and molecular biology.</p>
