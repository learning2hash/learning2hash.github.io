Background: Over the last years, more and more biological data became
available. Besides the pure amount of new data, also its dimensionality - the
number of different attributes per data point - increased. Recently, especially
the amount of data on chromatin and its modifications increased considerably.
In the field of epigenetics, appropriate visualization tools designed for
highlighting the different aspects of epigenetic data are currently not
available. Results: We present a tool called TiBi-Scatter enabling correlation
analysis in 2D. This approach allows for analyzing multidimensional data while
keeping the use of resources such as memory small. Thus, it is in particular
applicable to large data sets. Conclusions: TiBi-Scatter is a resource-friendly
and easy to use tool that allows for the hypothesis-free analysis of large
multidimensional biological data sets.
