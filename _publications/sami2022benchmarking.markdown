The problem of distinguishing identical twins and non-twin look-alikes in
automated facial recognition (FR) applications has become increasingly
important with the widespread adoption of facial biometrics. Due to the high
facial similarity of both identical twins and look-alikes, these face pairs
represent the hardest cases presented to facial recognition tools. This work
presents an application of one of the largest twin datasets compiled to date to
address two FR challenges: 1) determining a baseline measure of facial
similarity between identical twins and 2) applying this similarity measure to
determine the impact of doppelgangers, or look-alikes, on FR performance for
large face datasets. The facial similarity measure is determined via a deep
convolutional neural network. This network is trained on a tailored
verification task designed to encourage the network to group together highly
similar face pairs in the embedding space and achieves a test AUC of 0.9799.
The proposed network provides a quantitative similarity score for any two given
faces and has been applied to large-scale face datasets to identify similar
face pairs. An additional analysis which correlates the comparison score
returned by a facial recognition tool and the similarity score returned by the
proposed network has also been performed.
