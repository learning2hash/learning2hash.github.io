With the explosive growth of users and items, Recommender Systems (RS) are
facing unprecedented challenges on both retrieval efficiency and storage cost.
Fortunately, Learning to Hash (L2H) techniques have been shown as a promising
solution to address the two dilemmas, whose core idea is encoding
high-dimensional data into compact hash codes. To this end, L2H for RS (HashRec
for short) has recently received widespread attention to support large-scale
recommendations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of current
HashRec algorithms. Specifically, we first introduce the commonly used
two-tower models in the recall stage and identify two search strategies
frequently employed in L2H. Then, we categorize prior works into two-tier
taxonomy based on: (i) the type of loss function and (ii) the optimization
strategy. We also introduce some commonly used evaluation metrics to measure
the performance of HashRec algorithms. Finally, we shed light on the
limitations of the current research and outline the future research directions.
Furthermore, the summary of HashRec methods reviewed in this survey can be
