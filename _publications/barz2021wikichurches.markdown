We introduce a novel dataset for architectural style classification,
consisting of 9,485 images of church buildings. Both images and style labels
were sourced from Wikipedia. The dataset can serve as a benchmark for various
research fields, as it combines numerous real-world challenges: fine-grained
distinctions between classes based on subtle visual features, a comparatively
small sample size, a highly imbalanced class distribution, a high variance of
viewpoints, and a hierarchical organization of labels, where only some images
are labeled at the most precise level. In addition, we provide 631 bounding box
annotations of characteristic visual features for 139 churches from four major
categories. These annotations can, for example, be useful for research on
fine-grained classification, where additional expert knowledge about
distinctive object parts is often available. Images and annotations are
