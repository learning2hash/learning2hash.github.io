In recent years, with the prevalence of social media and smart devices,
people causally reveal their locations such as shops, hotels, and restaurants
in their tweets. Recognizing and linking such fine-grained location mentions to
well-defined location profiles are beneficial for retrieval and recommendation
systems. In this paper, we propose DLocRL, a new deep learning pipeline for
fine-grained location recognition and linking in tweets, and verify its
effectiveness on a real-world Twitter dataset.
