Deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained for the ImageNet
classification task have been successfully adopted to tasks in other domains,
such as texture description and object proposal generation, but these tasks
require annotations for images in the new domain. In this paper, we focus on a
novel and challenging task in the pure unsupervised setting: fine-grained image
retrieval. Even with image labels, fine-grained images are difficult to
classify, let alone the unsupervised retrieval task. We propose the Selective
Convolutional Descriptor Aggregation (SCDA) method. SCDA firstly localizes the
main object in fine-grained images, a step that discards the noisy background
and keeps useful deep descriptors. The selected descriptors are then aggregated
and dimensionality reduced into a short feature vector using the best practices
we found. SCDA is unsupervised, using no image label or bounding box
annotation. Experiments on six fine-grained datasets confirm the effectiveness
of SCDA for fine-grained image retrieval. Besides, visualization of the SCDA
features shows that they correspond to visual attributes (even subtle ones),
which might explain SCDA's high mean average precision in fine-grained
retrieval. Moreover, on general image retrieval datasets, SCDA achieves
comparable retrieval results with state-of-the-art general image retrieval
approaches.
