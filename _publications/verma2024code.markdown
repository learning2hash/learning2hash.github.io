Private information retrieval from a single server is considered, utilizing
random linear codes. Presented is a modified version of the first code-based
single-server computational PIR scheme proposed by Holzbaur, Hollanti, and
Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., "Computational Code-Based Single-Server
Private Information Retrieval", 2020 IEEE ISIT]. The original scheme was broken
in [Bordage et al., "On the privacy of a code-based single-server computational
PIR scheme", Cryptogr. Comm., 2021] by an attack arising from highly probable
rank differences in sub-matrices of the user's query. Here, this attack is now
circumvented by ensuring that the sub-matrices have negligible rank difference.
Furthermore, the rank difference cannot be attributed to the desired file
index, thereby ensuring the privacy of the scheme. In the case of retrieving
multiple files, the rate of the modified scheme is largely unaffected and at
par with the original scheme.
