This paper presents a framework for generating adventure games from open
data. Focusing on the murder mystery type of adventure games, the generator is
able to transform open data from Wikipedia articles, OpenStreetMap and images
from Wikimedia Commons into WikiMysteries. Every WikiMystery game revolves
around the murder of a person with a Wikipedia article and populates the game
with suspects who must be arrested by the player if guilty of the murder or
absolved if innocent. Starting from only one person as the victim, an extensive
generative pipeline finds suspects, their alibis, and paths connecting them
from open data, transforms open data into cities, buildings, non-player
characters, locks and keys and dialog options. The paper describes in detail
each generative step, provides a specific playthrough of one WikiMystery where
Albert Einstein is murdered, and evaluates the outcomes of games generated for
the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.
