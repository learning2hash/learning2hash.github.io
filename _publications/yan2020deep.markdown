Hashing is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in large45;scale data space by embedding high45;dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. However large45;scale high45;speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi45;view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore we try to introduce the multi45;view deep neural network into the hash learning field and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a supervised multi45;view hash model which can enhance the multi45;view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi45;view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi45;data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi45;view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR45;10 NUS45;WIDE and MS45;COCO datasets and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art single45;view and multi45;view hashing methods.
