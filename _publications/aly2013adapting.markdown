This report describes metrics for the evaluation of the effectiveness of
segment-based retrieval based on existing binary information retrieval metrics.
This metrics are described in the context of a task for the hyperlinking of
video segments. This evaluation approach re-uses existing evaluation measures
from the standard Cranfield evaluation paradigm. Our adaptation approach can in
principle be used with any kind of effectiveness measure that uses binary
relevance, and for other segment-baed retrieval tasks. In our video
hyperlinking setting, we use precision at a cut-off rank n and mean average
precision.
