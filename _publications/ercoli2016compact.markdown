In this paper we present an efficient method for visual descriptors retrieval
based on compact hash codes computed using a multiple k-means assignment. The
method has been applied to the problem of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)
search of local and global visual content descriptors, and it has been tested
on different datasets: three large scale public datasets of up to one billion
descriptors (BIGANN) and, supported by recent progress in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), also on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. Experimental results
show that, despite its simplicity, the proposed method obtains a very high
performance that makes it superior to more complex state-of-the-art methods.
