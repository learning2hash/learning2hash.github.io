The growing explosion in the use of surveillance cameras in public security
highlights the importance of vehicle search from large-scale image databases.
Precise vehicle search, aiming at finding out all instances for a given query
vehicle image, is a challenging task as different vehicles will look very
similar to each other if they share same visual attributes. To address this
problem, we propose the Repression Network (RepNet), a novel multi-task
learning framework, to learn discriminative features for each vehicle image
from both coarse-grained and detailed level simultaneously. Besides, benefited
from the satisfactory accuracy of attribute classification, a bucket search
method is proposed to reduce the retrieval time while still maintaining
competitive performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the revised
VehcileID dataset. Experimental results show that our RepNet achieves the
state-of-the-art performance and the bucket search method can reduce the
retrieval time by about 24 times.
