In this paper, we present the general theory of embedding independence tests
on Hilbert spaces that generalizes the concepts of distance covariance,
distance multivariance and HSIC. This is done by defining new types of kernel
on an \(n\) Cartesian product called positive definite independent of order \(k\).
An emphasis is given on the continuous case in order to obtain a version of the
Kernel Mean Embedding for this new classes of kernels. We also provide \(2\)
explicit methods to construct examples for this new type of kernel on a general
space by using Bernstein functions of several variables and completely monotone
functions of higher order.
