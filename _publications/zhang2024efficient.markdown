ANNS for embedded vector representations of texts is commonly used in
information retrieval, with two important information representations being
sparse and dense vectors. While it has been shown that combining these
representations improves accuracy, the current method of conducting sparse and
dense vector searches separately suffers from low scalability and high system
complexity. Alternatively, building a unified index faces challenges with
accuracy and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a graph-based ANNS
algorithm for dense-sparse hybrid vectors. Firstly, we propose a distribution
alignment method to improve accuracy, which pre-samples dense and sparse
vectors to analyze their distance distribution statistic, resulting in a
1%\(\sim\)9% increase in accuracy. Secondly, to improve efficiency, we design an
adaptive two-stage computation strategy that initially computes dense distances
only and later computes hybrid distances. Further, we prune the sparse vectors
to speed up the calculation. Compared to naive implementation, we achieve
\(\sim2.1\times\) acceleration. Thorough experiments show that our algorithm
achieves 8.9x\(\sim\)11.7x throughput at equal accuracy compared to existing
hybrid vector search algorithms.
