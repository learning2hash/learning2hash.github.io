Developing specialized dialogue systems for mental health support requires multi-turn conversation data which has recently garnered increasing attention. However gathering and releasing large-scale and real-life multi-turn conversations to facilitate advancements in mental health presents challenges due to data privacy protection as well as the time and cost involved. To address the challenges related to data scarcity we introduce SMILE a single-turn to multi-turn inclusive language expansion technique that prompts ChatGPT to rewrite public single-turn dialogues into multi-turn ones. Our work begins with the analysis of language transformation validating the feasibility of the proposed method when compared with other baseline methods. We then conduct a study on dialogue diversity including lexical features semantic features and dialogue topics demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore we implement an expert evaluation and the results demonstrate that the dialogues generated with our proposed method are of higher quality than those generated with other baseline methods. Thus we employ our method to generate a large-scale diverse and high-quality dialogue dataset named SmileChat comprising 55165 dialogues in total with an average of 10.4 turns per dialogue. Finally we utilize the collected corpus to develop a mental health chatbot MeChat. To better assess the overall quality of SmileChat we collect a real-life chat dataset comprising 82 counseling dialogues for model evaluation. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our trained dialogue system exhibits significant improvements showcasing that SmileChat is high-quality and practical.
