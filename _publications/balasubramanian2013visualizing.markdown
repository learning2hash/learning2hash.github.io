The motivation of this work is two-fold - a) to compare between two different
modes of visualizing data that exists in a bag of vectors format b) to propose
a theoretical model that supports a new mode of visualizing data. Visualizing
high dimensional data can be achieved using Minimum Volume Embedding, but the
data has to exist in a format suitable for computing similarities while
preserving local distances. This paper compares the visualization between two
methods of representing data and also proposes a new method providing sample
visualizations for that method.
