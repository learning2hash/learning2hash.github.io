We introduce Multi-SimLex, a large-scale lexical resource and evaluation
benchmark covering datasets for 12 typologically diverse languages, including
major languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Russian) as well as
less-resourced ones (e.g., Welsh, Kiswahili). Each language dataset is
annotated for the lexical relation of semantic similarity and contains 1,888
semantically aligned concept pairs, providing a representative coverage of word
classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs), frequency ranks, similarity
intervals, lexical fields, and concreteness levels. Additionally, owing to the
alignment of concepts across languages, we provide a suite of 66 cross-lingual
semantic similarity datasets. Due to its extensive size and language coverage,
Multi-SimLex provides entirely novel opportunities for experimental evaluation
and analysis. On its monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks, we evaluate and
analyze a wide array of recent state-of-the-art monolingual and cross-lingual
representation models, including static and contextualized word embeddings
(such as fastText, M-BERT and XLM), externally informed lexical
representations, as well as fully unsupervised and (weakly) supervised
cross-lingual word embeddings. We also present a step-by-step dataset creation
protocol for creating consistent, Multi-Simlex-style resources for additional
languages. We make these contributions -- the public release of Multi-SimLex
datasets, their creation protocol, strong baseline results, and in-depth
analyses which can be be helpful in guiding future developments in multilingual
lexical semantics and representation learning -- available via a website which
will encourage community effort in further expansion of Multi-Simlex to many
more languages. Such a large-scale semantic resource could inspire significant
further advances in NLP across languages.
