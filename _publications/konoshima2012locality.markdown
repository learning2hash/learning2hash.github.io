We propose a learning method with feature selection for Locality-Sensitive Hashing. Locality-Sensitive Hashing converts feature vectors into bit arrays. These bit arrays can be used to perform similarity searches and personal authentication. The proposed method uses bit arrays longer than those used in the end for similarity and other searches and by learning selects the bits that will be used. We demonstrated this method can effectively perform optimization for cases such as fingerprint images with a large number of labels and extremely few data that share the same labels, as well as verifying that it is also effective for natural images, handwritten digits, and speech features.
