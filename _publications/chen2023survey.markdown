Recommender systems is set up to address the issue of information overload in traditional information retrieval systems which is focused on recommending information that is of most interest to users from massive information. Generally there is a sequential nature and heterogeneity to the behavior of a person interacting with a system leading to the proposal of multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR). MBSR is a relatively new and worthy direction for in-depth research which can achieve state-of-the-art recommendation through suitable modeling and some related works have been proposed. This survey aims to shed light on the MBSR problem. Firstly we introduce MBSR in detail including its problem definition application scenarios and challenges faced. Secondly we detail the classification of MBSR including neighborhood-based methods matrix factorization-based methods and deep learning-based methods where we further classify the deep learning-based methods into different learning architectures based on RNN GNN Transformer and generic architectures as well as architectures that integrate hybrid techniques. In each method we present related works based on the data perspective and the modeling perspective as well as analyze the strengths weaknesses and features of these works. Finally we discuss some promising future research directions to address the challenges and improve the current status of MBSR.
