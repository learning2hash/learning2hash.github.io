Permutation arrays under the Chebyshev metric have been considered for error
correction in noisy channels. Let \(P(n,d)\) denote the maximum size of any array
of permutations on \(n\) symbols with pairwise Chebyshev distance \(d\). We give
new techniques and improved upper and lower bounds on \(P(n,d)\), including a
precise formula for \(P(n,2)\).
