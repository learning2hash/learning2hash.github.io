The family of image visibility graphs (IVGs) have been recently introduced as
simple algorithms by which scalar fields can be mapped into graphs. Here we
explore the usefulness of such operator in the scenario of image processing and
image classification. We demonstrate that the link architecture of the image
visibility graphs encapsulates relevant information on the structure of the
images and we explore their potential as image filters and compressors. We
introduce several graph features, including the novel concept of Visibility
Patches, and show through several examples that these features are highly
informative, computationally efficient and universally applicable for general
pattern recognition and image classification tasks.
