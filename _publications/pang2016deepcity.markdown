Online social networks being extended to geographical space has resulted in
large amount of user check-in data. Understanding check-ins can help to build
appealing applications, such as location recommendation. In this paper, we
propose DeepCity, a feature learning framework based on deep learning, to
profile users and locations, with respect to user demographic and location
category prediction. Both of the predictions are essential for social network
companies to increase user engagement. The key contribution of DeepCity is the
proposal of task-specific random walk which uses the location and user
properties to guide the feature learning to be specific to each prediction
task. Experiments conducted on 42M check-ins in three cities collected from
Instagram have shown that DeepCity achieves a superior performance and
outperforms other baseline models significantly.
