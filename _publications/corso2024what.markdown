TikTok is a social media platform that has gained immense popularity over the
last few years, particularly among younger demographics, due to the viral
trends and challenges shared worldwide. The recent release of a free Research
API opens the door to collecting data on posted videos, associated comments,
and user activities. Our study focuses on evaluating the reliability of the
results returned by the Research API, by collecting and analyzing a random
sample of TikTok videos posted in a span of 6 years. Our preliminary results
are instrumental for future research that aims to study the platform,
highlighting caveats on the geographical distribution of videos and on the
global prevalence of viral and conspiratorial hashtags.
