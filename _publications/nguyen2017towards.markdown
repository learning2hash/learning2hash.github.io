Digitisation of natural history collections not only preserves precious
information about biological diversity, it also enables us to share, analyse,
annotate and compare specimens to gain new insights. High-resolution,
full-colour 3D capture of biological specimens yields color and geometry
information complementary to other techniques (e.g., 2D capture, electron
scanning and micro computed tomography). However 3D colour capture of small
specimens is slow for reasons including specimen handling, the narrow depth of
field of high magnification optics, and the large number of images required to
resolve complex shapes of specimens. In this paper, we outline techniques to
accelerate 3D image capture, including using a desktop robotic arm to automate
the insect handling process; using a calibrated pan-tilt rig to avoid attaching
calibration targets to specimens; using light field cameras to capture images
at an extended depth of field in one shot; and using 3D Web and mixed reality
tools to facilitate the annotation, distribution and visualisation of 3D
digital models.
