Opinion mining on social media posts has become more and more popular. Users
often express their opinion on a topic not only with words but they also use
image symbols such as emoticons and emoji. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of emoji-based features in opinion classification of Uzbek texts, and
more specifically movie review comments from YouTube. Several classification
algorithms are tested, and feature ranking is performed to evaluate the
discriminative ability of the emoji-based features.
