The \\(q\\)-ary block codes with two distances \\(d\\) and \\(d+1\\) are considered.
Several constructions of such codes are given, as in the linear case all codes
can be obtained by a simple modification of linear equidistant codes. Upper
bounds for the maximum cardinality of such codes is derived. Tables of lower
and upper bounds for small \\(q\\) and \\(n\\) are presented.
