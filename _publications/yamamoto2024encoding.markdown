Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) proposed by Jarek Duda are high-performance
distortionless data compression schemes that can achieve almost the same
compression performance as arithmetic codes with less arithmetic operations
than arithmetic coding. The ANS is widely used in various practical systems
like Facebook, Apple, Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, and Pixar, due to their high
performance, but many researchers still lack much knowledge about the ANS. This
paper thoroughly explains the encoding and decoding algorithms of the ANS, and
theoretically analyzes the average code length achievable by the ANS.
