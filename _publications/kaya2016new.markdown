In this work, new construction methods for self-dual codes are given. The
methods use the short Kharaghani array and a variation of it. These are
applicable to any commutative Frobenius ring. We apply the constructions over
the ring F_2 + uF_2 and self-dual Type I [64, 32, 12]_2-codes with various
weight enumerators obtained as Gray images. By the use of an extension theorem
for self-dual codes we were able to construct 27 new extremal binary self-dual
codes of length 68. The existence of the extremal binary self-dual codes with
these weight enumerators was previously unknown.
