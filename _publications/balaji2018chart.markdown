Images greatly help in understanding, interpreting and visualizing data.
Adding textual description to images is the first and foremost principle of web
accessibility. Visually impaired users using screen readers will use these
textual descriptions to get better understanding of images present in digital
contents. In this paper, we propose Chart-Text a novel fully automated system
that creates textual description of chart images. Given a PNG image of a chart,
our Chart-Text system creates a complete textual description of it. First, the
system classifies the type of chart and then it detects and classifies the
labels and texts in the charts. Finally, it uses specific image processing
algorithms to extract relevant information from the chart images. Our proposed
system achieves an accuracy of 99.72% in classifying the charts and an accuracy
of 78.9% in extracting the data and creating the corresponding textual
description.
