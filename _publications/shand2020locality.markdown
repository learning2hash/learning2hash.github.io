We discuss the problem of performing similarity search over function spaces. To perform search over such spaces in a reasonable amount of time, we use \{\it locality-sensitive hashing\} (LSH). We present two methods that allow LSH functions on \\(\mathbb{R}^N\\) to be extended to \\(L^p\\) spaces: one using function approximation in an orthonormal basis, and another using (quasi-)Monte Carlo-style techniques. We use the presented hashing schemes to construct an LSH family for Wasserstein distance over one-dimensional, continuous probability distributions.
