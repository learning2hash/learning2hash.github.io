<p>We discuss the problem of performing similarity search over function
spaces. To perform search over such spaces in a reasonable amount of
time, we use {} (LSH). We present two methods that allow LSH functions
on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^N\)</span> to be extended to
<span class="math inline">\(L^p\)</span> spaces: one using function
approximation in an orthonormal basis, and another using (quasi-)Monte
Carlo-style techniques. We use the presented hashing schemes to
construct an LSH family for Wasserstein distance over one-dimensional,
continuous probability distributions.</p>
