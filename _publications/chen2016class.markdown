In this paper we study a class of random Cantor sets. We determine their
almost sure Hausdorff, packing, box, and Assouad dimensions. From a topological
point of view, we also compute their typical dimensions in the sense of Baire
category. For the natural random measures on these random Cantor sets, we
consider their almost sure lower and upper local dimensions. In the end we
study the hitting probabilities of a special subclass of these random Cantor
sets.
