A coreset is a point set containing information about geometric properties of
a larger point set. A series of previous works show that in many machine
learning problems, especially in clustering problems, coreset could be very
useful to build efficient algorithms. Two main measures of an coreset
construction algorithm's performance are the running time of the algorithm and
the size of the coreset output by the algorithm. In this paper we study the
construction of coresets for the \((k,z)\)-clustering problem, which is a
generalization of \(k\)-means and \(k\)-median problem. By properly designing a
sketching-based distance estimation data structure, we propose faster
algorithms that construct coresets with matching size of the state-of-the-art
results.
