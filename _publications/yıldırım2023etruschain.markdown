This article proposes a blockchain-based file storage system that utilizes
DNA encryption for enhanced security. The system utilizes blockchain technology
to provide decentralized and tamper-proof file storage, while DNA encryption is
employed to further strengthen data protection. The proposed system employs a
unique approach to encryption by utilizing DNA sequences as keys, which
enhances data security and privacy. Additionally, the use of blockchain
technology ensures that all file storage and access operations are transparent,
immutable, and distributed among a network of nodes, making it resistant to
tampering and unauthorized access. The proposed system represents a significant
advancement in file storage security and provides a foundation for future
research and development in the field of blockchain-based data storage
