For any finite field \\(\{\mathbb F\}_q\\) with \\(q\\) elements, we study the set
\\(\{\mathcal F\}_\{(q,m)\}\\) of functions from \\(\{\mathbb F\}_q^m\\) into \\(\{\mathbb
F\}^q\\). We introduce a transformation that allows us to determine a linear
system of \\(q^\{m+1\}\\) equations and \\(q^\{m+1\}\\) unknowns, which has for solution
the Hamming distances of a function in \\(\{\mathcal F\}_\{(q,m)\}\\) to all the affine
functions.
