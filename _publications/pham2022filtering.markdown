We present Falconn++ a novel locality45;sensitive filtering (LSF) approach for approximate nearest neighbor search on angular distance. Falconn++ can filter out potential far away points in any hash bucket before querying which results in higher quality candidates compared to other hashing45;based solutions. Theoretically Falconn++ asymptotically achieves lower query time complexity than Falconn an optimal locality45;sensitive hashing scheme on angular distance. Empirically Falconn++ achieves a higher recall45;speed tradeoff than Falconn on many real45;world data sets. Falconn++ is also competitive with HNSW an efficient representative of graph45;based solutions on high search recall regimes.
