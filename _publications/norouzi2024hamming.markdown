<p>Motivated by large-scale multimedia applications we propose to learn
mappings from high-dimensional data to binary codes that preserve
semantic similarity. Binary codes are well suited to large-scale
applications as they are storage efficient and permit exact sub-linear
kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings,
and uses a flexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome
discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a
piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent
structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm
that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval
performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classification results
using no more than kNN on the binary codes.</p>
