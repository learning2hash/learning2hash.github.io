Cuneiform writing, an old art style, allows us to see into the past. Aside
from Egyptian hieroglyphs, the cuneiform script is one of the oldest writing
systems. Many historians place Hebrew's origins in antiquity. For example, we
used the same approach to decipher the cuneiform languages; after learning how
to decipher one old language, we would visit an archaeologist to learn how to
decipher any other ancient language. We propose a deep-learning-based sign
detector method to speed up this procedure to identify and group cuneiform
tablet images according to Hebrew letter content. The Hebrew alphabet is
notoriously difficult and costly to gather the training data needed for deep
learning, which entails enclosing Hebrew characters in boxes. We solve this
problem using pre-existing transliterations and a sign-by-sign representation
of the tablet's content in Latin characters. We recommend one of the supervised
approaches because these do not include sign localization: We Find the
transliteration signs in the tablet photographs by comparing them to their
corresponding transliterations. Then, retrain the sign detector using these
localized signs instead of utilizing annotations. Afterward, a more effective
sign detector enhances the alignment quality. Consequently, this research aims
to use the Yolov8 object identification pretraining model to identify Hebrew
characters and categorize the cuneiform tablets.
