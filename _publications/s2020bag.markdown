Medical Image Retrieval is a challenging field in Visual information
retrieval, due to the multi-dimensional and multi-modal context of the
underlying content. Traditional models often fail to take the intrinsic
characteristics of data into consideration, and have thus achieved limited
accuracy when applied to medical images. The Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is a
technique that can be used to effectively represent intrinsic image features in
vector space, so that applications like image classification and similar-image
search can be optimized. In this paper, we present a MedIR approach based on
the BoVW model for content-based medical image retrieval. As medical images as
multi-dimensional, they exhibit underlying cluster and manifold information
which enhances semantic relevance and allows for label uniformity. Hence, the
BoVW features extracted for each image are used to train a supervised machine
learning classifier based on positive and negative training images, for
extending content based image retrieval. During experimental validation, the
proposed model performed very well, achieving a Mean Average Precision of
88.89% during top-3 image retrieval experiments.
