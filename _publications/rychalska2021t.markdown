The key challenge in cross-modal retrieval is to find similarities between
objects represented with different modalities, such as image and text. However,
each modality embeddings stem from non-related feature spaces, which causes the
notorious 'heterogeneity gap'. Currently, many cross-modal systems try to
bridge the gap with self-attention. However, self-attention has been widely
criticized for its quadratic complexity, which prevents many real-life
applications. In response to this, we propose T-EMDE - a neural density
estimator inspired by the recently introduced Efficient Manifold Density
Estimator (EMDE) from the area of recommender systems. EMDE operates on
sketches - representations especially suitable for multimodal operations.
However, EMDE is non-differentiable and ingests precomputed, static embeddings.
With T-EMDE we introduce a trainable version of EMDE which allows full
end-to-end training. In contrast to self-attention, the complexity of our
solution is linear to the number of tokens/segments. As such, T-EMDE is a
drop-in replacement for the self-attention module, with beneficial influence on
both speed and metric performance in cross-modal settings. It facilitates
communication between modalities, as each global text/image representation is
expressed with a standardized sketch histogram which represents the same
manifold structures irrespective of the underlying modality. We evaluate T-EMDE
by introducing it into two recent cross-modal SOTA models and achieving new
state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and decreasing model latency by
up to 20%.
