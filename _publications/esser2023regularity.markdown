We study the regularity properties of random wavelet series constructed by
multiplying the coefficients of a deterministic wavelet series with unbounded
I.I.D. random variables. In particular, we show that, at the opposite to what
happens for Fourier series, the randomization of almost every continuous
function gives an almost surely nowhere locally bounded function.
