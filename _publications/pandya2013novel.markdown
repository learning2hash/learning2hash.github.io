The availability of bandwidth for internet access is sufficient enough to
communicate digital assets. These digital assets are subjected to various types
of threats. [19] As a result of this, protection mechanism required for the
protection of digital assets is of priority in research. The threat of current
focus is unauthorized copying of digital assets which give boost to piracy.
This under the copyright act is illegal and a robust mechanism is required to
curb this kind of unauthorized copy. To safeguard the copyright digital assets,
a robust digital watermarking technique is needed. The existing digital
watermarking techniques protect digital assets by embedding a digital watermark
into a host digital image. This embedding does induce slight distortion in the
host image but the distortion is usually too small to be noticed. At the same
time the embedded watermark must be robust enough to with stand deliberate
attacks. There are various techniques of digital watermarking but researchers
are making constant efforts to increase the robustness of the watermark image.
The layered approach of watermarking based on Huffman coding [5] can soon
increase the robustness of digital watermark.[11] Ultimately, increasing the
security of copyright of protection. The proposed work is in similar direction
where in RMI (Random Matrix Image) is used in place of Huffman coding. This
innovative algorithm has considerably increased the robustness in digital
watermark while also enhancing security of production
