Deep hashing retrieval has gained widespread use in big data retrieval due to
its robust feature extraction and efficient hashing process. However, training
advanced deep hashing models has become more expensive due to complex
optimizations and large datasets. Coreset selection and Dataset Condensation
lower overall training costs by reducing the volume of training data without
significantly compromising model accuracy for classification task. In this
paper, we explore the effect of mainstream dataset condensation methods for
deep hashing retrieval and propose IEM (Information-intensive feature Embedding
Matching), which is centered on distribution matching and incorporates model
and data augmentation techniques to further enhance the feature of hashing
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
efficiency of our approach.
