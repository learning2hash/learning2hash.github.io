The expenses involved in training state45;of45;the45;art deep hashing retrieval models have witnessed an increase due to the adoption of more sophisticated models and large45;scale datasets. Dataset Distillation (DD) or Dataset Condensation(DC) focuses on generating smaller synthetic dataset that retains the original information. Nevertheless existing DD methods face challenges in maintaining a trade45;off between accuracy and efficiency. And the state45;of45;the45;art dataset distillation methods can not expand to all deep hashing retrieval methods. In this paper we propose an efficient condensation framework that addresses these limitations by matching the feature45;embedding between synthetic set and real set. Furthermore we enhance the diversity of features by incorporating the strategies of early45;stage augmented models and multi45;formation. Extensive experiments provide compelling evidence of the remarkable superiority of our approach both in terms of performance and efficiency compared to state45;of45;the45;art baseline methods.
