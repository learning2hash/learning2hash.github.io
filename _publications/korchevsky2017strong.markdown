We establish new sufficient conditions for the applicability of the strong
law of large numbers (SLLN) for sequences of pairwise independent
non-identically distributed random variables. These results generalize
Etemadi's extension of Kolmogorov's SLLN for identically distributed random
variables. Some of the obtained results hold with an arbitrary norming sequence
in place of the classical normalization.
