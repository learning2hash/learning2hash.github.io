Hierarchical segmentation entails creating segmentations at varying levels of
granularity. We introduce the first hierarchical semantic segmentation dataset
with subpart annotations for natural images, which we call SPIN
(SubPartImageNet). We also introduce two novel evaluation metrics to evaluate
how well algorithms capture spatial and semantic relationships across
hierarchical levels. We benchmark modern models across three different tasks
and analyze their strengths and weaknesses across objects, parts, and subparts.
To facilitate community-wide progress, we publicly release our dataset at
