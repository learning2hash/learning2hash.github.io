We consider random permutations which are spherically symmetric with respect
to a metric on the symmetric group \\(S_n\\) and are consistent as \\(n\\) varies. The
extreme infinitely spherically symmetric permutation-valued processes are
identified for the Hamming, Kendall-tau and Caley metrics. The proofs in all
three cases are based on a unified approach through stochastic monotonicity.
