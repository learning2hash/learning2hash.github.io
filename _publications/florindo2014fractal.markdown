In this work, we propose a novel technique for obtaining descriptors of
gray-level texture images. The descriptors are provided by applying a
multiscale transform to the fractal dimension of the image estimated through
the probability (Voss) method. The effectiveness of the descriptors is verified
in a classification task using benchmark over texture datasets. The results
obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method as a tool for the
description and discrimination of texture images.
