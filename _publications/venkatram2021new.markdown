A new run length encoding algorithm for lossless data compression that
exploits positional redundancy by representing data in a two-dimensional model
of concentric circles is presented. This visual transform enables detection of
runs (each of a different character) in which runs need not be contiguous and
hence, is a generalization of run length encoding. Its advantages and drawbacks
are characterized by comparing its performance with TurboRLE.
