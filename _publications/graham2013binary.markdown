Suppose a binary string x = x_1...x_n is being broadcast repeatedly over a
faulty communication channel. Each time, the channel delivers a fixed number m
of the digits (m<n) with the lost digits chosen uniformly at random, and the
order of the surviving digits preserved. How large does m have to be to
reconstruct the message?
