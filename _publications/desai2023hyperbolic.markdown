Visual and linguistic concepts naturally organize themselves in a hierarchy,
where a textual concept "dog" entails all images that contain dogs. Despite
being intuitive, current large-scale vision and language models such as CLIP do
not explicitly capture such hierarchy. We propose MERU, a contrastive model
that yields hyperbolic representations of images and text. Hyperbolic spaces
have suitable geometric properties to embed tree-like data, so MERU can better
capture the underlying hierarchy in image-text datasets. Our results show that
MERU learns a highly interpretable and structured representation space while
being competitive with CLIP's performance on standard multi-modal tasks like
image classification and image-text retrieval. Our code and models are
