Object detection is considered as one of the most challenging problems in
computer vision, since it requires correct prediction of both classes and
locations of objects in images. In this study, we define a more difficult
scenario, namely zero-shot object detection (ZSD) where no visual training data
is available for some of the target object classes. We present a novel approach
to tackle this ZSD problem, where a convex combination of embeddings are used
in conjunction with a detection framework. For evaluation of ZSD methods, we
propose a simple dataset constructed from Fashion-MNIST images and also a
custom zero-shot split for the Pascal VOC detection challenge. The experimental
results suggest that our method yields promising results for ZSD.
