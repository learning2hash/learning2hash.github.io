3D model retrieval techniques can be classified as histogram-based,
view-based and graph-based approaches. We propose a hybrid shape descriptor
which combines the global and local radial distance features by utilizing the
histogram-based and view-based approaches respectively. We define an
area-weighted global radial distance with respect to the center of the bounding
sphere of the model and encode its distribution into a 2D histogram as the
global radial distance shape descriptor. We then uniformly divide the bounding
cube of a 3D model into a set of small cubes and define their centers as local
centers. Then, we compute the local radial distance of a point based on the
nearest local center. By sparsely sampling a set of views and encoding the
local radial distance feature on the rendered views by color coding, we extract
the local radial distance shape descriptor. Based on these two shape
descriptors, we develop a hybrid radial distance shape descriptor for 3D model
retrieval. Experiment results show that our hybrid shape descriptor outperforms
several typical histogram-based and view-based approaches.
