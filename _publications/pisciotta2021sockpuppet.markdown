In Online Social Networks (OSN) numerous are the cases in which users create
multiple accounts that publicly seem to belong to different people but are
actually fake identities of the same person. These fictitious characters can be
exploited to carry out abusive behaviors such as manipulating opinions,
spreading fake news and disturbing other users. In literature this problem is
known as the Sockpuppet problem. In our work we focus on Telegram, a
wide-spread instant messaging application, often known for its exploitation by
members of organized crime and terrorism, and more in general for its high
presence of people who have offensive behaviors.
