This paper introduces Multi-Level Spherical LSH: parameter-free, a multi-level, data-dependant Locality Sensitive Hashing data structure for solving the Approximate Near Neighbors Problem (ANN). This data structure uses a modified version of a multi-probe adaptive querying algorithm, with the potential of achieving a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^p + t)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} query run time, for all inputs n where $t <= n$.
