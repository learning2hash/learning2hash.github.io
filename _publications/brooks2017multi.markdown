<p>This paper introduces “Multi-Level Spherical LSH”: parameter-free, a
multi-level, data-dependant Locality Sensitive Hashing data structure
for solving the Approximate Near Neighbors Problem (ANN). This data
structure uses a modified version of a multi-probe adaptive querying
algorithm, with the potential of achieving a <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^p + t)\)</span> query run time, for all inputs
n where <span class="math inline">\(t
&lt;= n\)</span>.</p>
