Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in utilizing tools but their ability is limited by API availability and the instability of implicit reasoning particularly when both planning and execution are involved. To overcome these limitations we propose CREATOR a novel framework that enables LLMs to create their own tools using documentation and code realization. CREATOR disentangles abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution resulting in improved performance. We evaluate CREATOR on MATH and TabMWP benchmarks respectively consisting of challenging math competition problems and diverse tabular contents. Remarkably CREATOR outperforms existing chain-of-thought program-of-thought and tool-using baselines. Additionally we introduce the Creation Challenge dataset featuring 2K diverse questions to emphasize the necessity and benefits of LLMs tool creation ability. Further research demonstrates that leveraging LLMs as tool creators facilitates knowledge transfer and LLMs exhibit varying levels of tool creation abilities enabling them to adapt to diverse situations. The tool creation ability revolutionizes the LLMs problem-solving paradigm driving us closer to the next frontier of artificial intelligence. All the codes and data are released.
