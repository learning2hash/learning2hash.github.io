In this paper, we will study the simplest kind of beauty that can be found in
a simple piece of music and can be appreciated universally. The proposed
approach shows that aesthetically appealing patterns deliver higher amount of
information over multiple levels in comparison with less aesthetically
appealing patterns when the same amount of energy is used. The proposed model
is tested on a set of beautiful music pieces.
