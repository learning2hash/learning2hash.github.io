This study attempts to provide explanations, descriptions and evaluations of
some most popular and current combinations of description and descriptor
frameworks, namely SIFT, SURF, MSER, and BRISK for keypoint extractors and
SIFT, SURF, BRISK, and FREAK for descriptors. Evaluations are made based on the
number of matches of keypoints and repeatability in various image variations.
It is used as the main parameter to assess how well combinations of algorithms
are in matching objects with different variations. There are many papers that
describe the comparison of detection and description features to detect objects
in images under various conditions, but the combination of algorithms attached
to them has not been much discussed. The problem domain is limited to different
illumination levels and affine transformations from different perspectives. To
evaluate the robustness of all combinations of algorithms, we use a stereo
image matching case.
