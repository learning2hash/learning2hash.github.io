In real-world applications, as data availability increases, obtaining labeled
data for machine learning (ML) projects remains challenging due to the high
costs and intensive efforts required for data annotation. Many ML projects,
particularly those focused on multi-label classification, also grapple with
data imbalance issues, where certain classes may lack sufficient data to train
effective classifiers. This study introduces and examines a novel oversampling
method for multi-label text classification, designed to address performance
challenges associated with data imbalance. The proposed method identifies
potential new samples from unlabeled data by leveraging similarity measures
between instances. By iteratively searching the unlabeled dataset, the method
locates instances similar to those in underrepresented classes and evaluates
their contribution to classifier performance enhancement. Instances that
demonstrate performance improvement are then added to the labeled dataset.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach effectively enhances
classifier performance post-oversampling.
