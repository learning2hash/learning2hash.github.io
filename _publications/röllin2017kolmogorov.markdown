We bound the error for the normal approximation of the number of triangles in
the Erdos-Renyi random graph with respect to the Kolmogorov metric. Our bounds
match the best available Wasserstein-bounds obtained by Barbour, Karonski and
Rucinski (1989), resolving a long-standing open problem. The proofs are based
on a new variant of the Stein-Tikhomirov method - a combination of Stein's
method and characteristic functions introduced by Tikhomirov (1980).
