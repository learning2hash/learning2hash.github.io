We propose a simple and efficient multi-hop dense retrieval approach for
answering complex open-domain questions, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two multi-hop datasets, HotpotQA and multi-evidence FEVER.
Contrary to previous work, our method does not require access to any
corpus-specific information, such as inter-document hyperlinks or
human-annotated entity markers, and can be applied to any unstructured text
corpus. Our system also yields a much better efficiency-accuracy trade-off,
matching the best published accuracy on HotpotQA while being 10 times faster at
inference time.
