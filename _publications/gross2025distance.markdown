In a recent paper, Aldous, Blanc and Curien asked which distributions can be
expressed as the distance between two independent random variables on some
separable measured metric space. We show that every nonnegative discrete
distribution whose support contains \(0\) arises in this way, as well as a class
of finitely supported distributions with density.
