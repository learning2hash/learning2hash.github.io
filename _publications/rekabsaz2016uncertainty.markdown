Word embedding, specially with its recent developments, promises a
quantification of the similarity between terms. However, it is not clear to
which extent this similarity value can be genuinely meaningful and useful for
subsequent tasks. We explore how the similarity score obtained from the models
is really indicative of term relatedness. We first observe and quantify the
uncertainty factor of the word embedding models regarding to the similarity
value. Based on this factor, we introduce a general threshold on various
dimensions which effectively filters the highly related terms. Our evaluation
on four information retrieval collections supports the effectiveness of our
approach as the results of the introduced threshold are significantly better
than the baseline while being equal to or statistically indistinguishable from
the optimal results.
