There is a large collection of Handwritten English paper documents of
Historical and Scientific importance. But paper documents are not recognized
directly by computer. Hence the closest way of indexing these documents is by
storing their document digital image. Hence a large database of document images
can replace the paper documents. But the document and data corresponding to
each image cannot be directly recognized by the computer.
  This paper applies the technique of word spotting using Modified Character
Shape Code to Handwritten English document images for quick and efficient query
search of words on a database of document images. It is different from other
Word Spotting techniques as it implements two level of selection for word
segments to match search query. First based on word size and then based on
character shape code of query. It makes the process faster and more efficient
and reduces the need of multiple pre-processing.
