Previous work has shown that the artist of an artwork can be identified by
use of computational methods that analyse digital images. However, the
digitised artworks are often investigated at a coarse scale discarding many of
the important details that may define an artist's style. In recent years high
resolution images of artworks have become available, which, combined with
increased processing power and new computational techniques, allow us to
analyse digital images of artworks at a very fine scale. In this work we train
and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the task of artist
attribution using artwork images of varying resolutions. To this end, we
combine two existing methods to enable the application of high resolution
images to CNNs. By comparing the attribution performances obtained at different
scales, we find that in most cases finer scales are beneficial to the
attribution performance, whereas for a minority of the artists, coarser scales
appear to be preferable. We conclude that artist attribution would benefit from
a multi-scale CNN approach which vastly expands the possibilities for
computational art forensics.
