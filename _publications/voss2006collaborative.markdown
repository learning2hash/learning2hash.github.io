This paper explores the system of categories that is used to classify
articles in Wikipedia. It is compared to collaborative tagging systems like
del.icio.us and to hierarchical classification like the Dewey Decimal
Classification (DDC). Specifics and commonalitiess of these systems of subject
indexing are exposed. Analysis of structural and statistical properties
(descriptors per record, records per descriptor, descriptor levels) shows that
the category system of Wikimedia is a thesaurus that combines collaborative
tagging and hierarchical subject indexing in a special way.
