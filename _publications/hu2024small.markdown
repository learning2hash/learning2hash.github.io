We study the small ball probability of an order-\(\ell\) simple random tensor
\(X=X^\{(1)\}\otimes\cdots\otimes X^\{(\ell)\}\) where \(X^\{(i)\}, 1\leq i\leq\ell\) are
independent random vectors in \(\mathbb\{R\}^n\) that are log-concave or have
independent coordinates with bounded densities. We show that the probability
that the projection of \(X\) onto an \(m\)-dimensional subspace \(F\) falls within an
Euclidean ball of length \(\epsilon\) is upper bounded by
\(\frac\{\epsilon\}\{(\ell-1)!\}\left(Clog\left(\frac\{e\}\{\epsilon\}\right)\right)^\{\ell\}\)
and also this upper bound is sharp when \(m\) is small. We also established that
a much better estimate holds true for a random subspace.
