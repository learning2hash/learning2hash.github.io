Measuring plagiarism in programming assignments is an essential task to the
educational procedure. This paper discusses the methods of plagiarism and its
detection in introductory programming course assignments written in C++. A
small corpus of assignments is made publically available. A general framework
to compute the similarity between a solution pair is developed that uses the
three token-based similarity methods as features and predicts if the solution
is plagiarized. The importance of each feature is also measured, which in
return ranks the effectiveness of each method in use. Finally, the artificially
generated dataset improves the results compared to the original data. We
achieved an F1 score of 0.955 and 0.971 on original and synthetic datasets.
