Supervised deep learning45;based hash and vector quantization are enabling fast and large45;scale image retrieval systems. By fully exploiting label annotations they are achieving outstanding retrieval performances compared to the conventional methods. However it is painstaking to assign labels precisely for a vast amount of training data and also the annotation process is error45;prone. To tackle these issues we propose the first deep unsupervised image retrieval method dubbed Self45;supervised Product Quantization (SPQ) network which is label45;free and trained in a self45;supervised manner. We design a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy that jointly learns codewords and deep visual descriptors by comparing individually transformed images (views). Our method analyzes the image contents to extract descriptive features allowing us to understand image representations for accurate retrieval. By conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks we demonstrate that the proposed method yields state45;of45;the45;art results even without supervised pretraining.
