Deep metric learning (DML) has received much attention in deep learning due
to its wide applications in computer vision. Previous studies have focused on
designing complicated losses and hard example mining methods, which are mostly
heuristic and lack of theoretical understanding. In this paper, we cast DML as
a simple pairwise binary classification problem that classifies a pair of
examples as similar or dissimilar. It identifies the most critical issue in
this problem--imbalanced data pairs. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple
and effective framework to sample pairs in a batch of data for updating the
model. The key to this framework is to define a robust loss for all pairs over
a mini-batch of data, which is formulated by distributionally robust
optimization. The flexibility in constructing the uncertainty decision set of
the dual variable allows us to recover state-of-the-art complicated losses and
also to induce novel variants. Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets
demonstrate that our simple and effective method outperforms the
state-of-the-art results. Codes are available at:
