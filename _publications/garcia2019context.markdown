Automatic art analysis aims to classify and retrieve artistic representations
from a collection of images by using computer vision and machine learning
techniques. In this work, we propose to enhance visual representations from
neural networks with contextual artistic information. Whereas visual
representations are able to capture information about the content and the style
of an artwork, our proposed context-aware embeddings additionally encode
relationships between different artistic attributes, such as author, school, or
historical period. We design two different approaches for using context in
automatic art analysis. In the first one, contextual data is obtained through a
multi-task learning model, in which several attributes are trained together to
find visual relationships between elements. In the second approach, context is
obtained through an art-specific knowledge graph, which encodes relationships
between artistic attributes. An exhaustive evaluation of both of our models in
several art analysis problems, such as author identification, type
classification, or cross-modal retrieval, show that performance is improved by
up to 7.3% in art classification and 37.24% in retrieval when context-aware
embeddings are used.
