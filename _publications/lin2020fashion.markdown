Complementary fashion item recommendation is critical for fashion outfit
completion. Existing methods mainly focus on outfit compatibility prediction
but not in a retrieval setting. We propose a new framework for outfit
complementary item retrieval. Specifically, a category-based subspace attention
network is presented, which is a scalable approach for learning the subspace
attentions. In addition, we introduce an outfit ranking loss that better models
the item relationships of an entire outfit. We evaluate our method on the
outfit compatibility, FITB and new retrieval tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval
