We present a set of parallel algorithms for computing exact k-nearest
neighbors in low dimensions. Many k-nearest neighbor algorithms use either a
kd-tree or the Morton ordering of the point set; our algorithms combine these
approaches using a data structure we call the \textit\{zd-tree\}. We show that
this combination is both theoretically efficient under common assumptions, and
fast in practice. For point sets of size \\(n\\) with bounded expansion constant
and bounded ratio, the zd-tree can be built in \\(O(n)\\) work with
\\(O(n^\{\epsilon\})\\) span for constant \\(\epsilon<1\\), and searching for the
\\(k\\)-nearest neighbors of a point takes expected \\(O(klog k)\\) time. We benchmark
our k-nearest neighbor algorithms against existing parallel k-nearest neighbor
algorithms, showing that our implementations are generally faster than the
state of the art as well as achieving 75x speedup on 144 hyperthreads.
Furthermore, the zd-tree supports parallel batch-dynamic insertions and
deletions; to our knowledge, it is the first k-nearest neighbor data structure
to support such updates. On point sets with bounded expansion constant and
bounded ratio, a batch-dynamic update of size \\(k\\) requires \\(O(k log n/k)\\) work
with \\(O(k^\{\epsilon\} + \text\{polylog\}(n))\\) span.
