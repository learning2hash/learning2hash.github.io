Research has shown that cryptographic APIs are hard to use. Consequently,
developers resort to using code examples available in online information
sources that are often not secure. We have developed a web platform, named
CryptoExplorer, stocked with numerous real-world secure and insecure examples
that developers can explore to learn how to use cryptographic APIs properly.
This platform currently provides 3,263 secure uses, and 5,897 insecure uses of
Java Cryptography Architecture mined from 2,324 Java projects on GitHub. A
preliminary study shows that CryptoExplorer provides developers with secure
crypto API use examples instantly, developers can save time compared to
searching on the internet for such examples, and they learn to avoid using
certain algorithms in APIs by studying misused API examples. We have a pipeline
to regularly mine more projects, and, on request, we offer our dataset to
researchers.
