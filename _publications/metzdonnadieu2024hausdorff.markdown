Consider the boundary \(\partial \mathbb D\) of the Brownian disk \(\mathbb D\)
as a metric space by endowing it with the (restriction of the) metric of
\(\mathbb D\). We show that the uniform measure on \(\partial \mathbb D\) coincides
with the Hausdorff measure associated with the gauge function \(h(s)=\kappa
s^2loglog(1/s)\) for some deterministic constant \(\kappa>0\). We also state the
analogous result for the boundary of the Brownian half-plane \(\mathbb H\). This
proves in particular that the uniform measure on the boundary of the Brownian
disk (resp. the Brownian half-plane) is determined by the metric on \(\mathbb D\)
(resp. on \(\mathbb H\)).
