Neighborhood gentrification plays a significant role in shaping the social
and economic well-being of both individuals and communities at large. While
some efforts have been made to detect gentrification in cities, existing
approaches rely mainly on estimated measures from survey data, require
substantial work of human labeling, and are limited in characterizing the
neighborhood as a whole. We propose a novel approach to detecting neighborhood
gentrification at a large-scale based on the physical appearance of
neighborhoods by incorporating historical street-level visual data. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing results from our approach
with gentrification measures from previous literature and case studies. Our
approach has the potential to supplement existing indicators of gentrification
and become a valid resource for urban researchers and policy makers.
