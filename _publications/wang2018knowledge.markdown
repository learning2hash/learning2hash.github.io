Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to represent entities and relations of
knowledge graph in a low-dimensional continuous vector space. Recent works
focus on incorporating structural knowledge with additional information, such
as entity descriptions, relation paths and so on. However, common used
additional information usually contains plenty of noise, which makes it hard to
learn valuable representation. In this paper, we propose a new kind of
additional information, called entity neighbors, which contain both semantic
and topological features about given entity. We then develop a deep memory
network model to encode information from neighbors. Employing a gating
mechanism, representations of structure and neighbors are integrated into a
joint representation. The experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing KGE methods utilizing entity descriptions and achieves
state-of-the-art metrics on 4 datasets.
