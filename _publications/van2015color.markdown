This chapter approaches the image retrieval system on the base of the colors of image. It creates fuzzy signature to describe the color of image on color space HSV and builds fuzzy Hamming distance (FHD) to evaluate the similarity between the images. In order to reduce the storage space and speed up the search of similar images it aims to create S-tree to store fuzzy signature relies on FHD and builds image retrieval algorithm on S-tree. Then it provides the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and an image retrieval method on FHD and S-tree. Last but not least based on this theory it also presents an application and experimental assessment of the process of querying similar image on the database system over 10000 images.
