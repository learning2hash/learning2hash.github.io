Hashing that projects data into binary codes has shown extraordinary talents in cross45;modal retrieval due to its low storage usage and high query speed. Despite their empirical success on some scenarios existing cross45;modal hashing methods usually fail to cross modality gap when fully45;paired data with plenty of labeled information is nonexistent. To circumvent this drawback motivated by the Divide45;and45;Conquer strategy we propose Deep Manifold Hashing (DMH) a novel method of dividing the problem of semi45;paired unsupervised cross45;modal retrieval into three sub45;problems and building one simple yet efficiency model for each sub45;problem. Specifically the first model is constructed for obtaining modality45;invariant features by complementing semi45;paired data based on manifold learning whereas the second model and the third model aim to learn hash codes and hash functions respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DMH compared with the state45;of45;the45;art fully45;paired and semi45;paired unsupervised cross45;modal hashing methods.
