An Ntimes n matrix on q symbols is called w_1ldotsw_t-separating if for arbitrary t pairwise disjoint column sets C_1ldotsC_t with C_i=w_i for 1le ile t there exists a row f such that f(C_1)ldotsf(C_t) are also pairwise disjoint where f(C_i) denotes the collection of components of C_i restricted to row f. Given integers Nq and w_1ldotsw_t denote by C(Nqw_1ldotsw_t) the maximal n such that a corresponding matrix does exist. The determination of C(Nqw_1ldotsw_t) has received remarkable attentions during the recent years. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce two novel methodologies to attack the upper bound of C(Nqw_1ldotsw_t). The first one is a combination of the famous graph removal lemma in extremal graph theory and a Johnson-type recursive inequality in coding theory and the second one is the probabilistic method. As a consequence we obtain several intriguing upper bounds for some parameters of C(Nqw_1ldotsw_t) which significantly improve the previously known results.
