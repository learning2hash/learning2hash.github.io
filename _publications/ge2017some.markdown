An \\(N\times n\\) matrix on \\(q\\) symbols is called
\\(\\{w_1,\ldots,w_t\\}\\)-separating if for arbitrary \\(t\\) pairwise disjoint column
sets \\(C_1,\ldots,C_t\\) with \\(|C_i|=w_i\\) for \\(1\le i\le t\\), there exists a row
\\(f\\) such that \\(f(C_1),\ldots,f(C_t)\\) are also pairwise disjoint, where \\(f(C_i)\\)
denotes the collection of components of \\(C_i\\) restricted to row \\(f\\).
  Given integers \\(N,q\\) and \\(w_1,\ldots,w_t\\), denote by
\\(C(N,q,\\{w_1,\ldots,w_t\\})\\) the maximal \\(n\\) such that a corresponding matrix
does exist.
  The determination of \\(C(N,q,\\{w_1,\ldots,w_t\\})\\) has received remarkable
attentions during the recent years.
  The main purpose of this paper is to introduce two novel methodologies to
attack the upper bound of \\(C(N,q,\\{w_1,\ldots,w_t\\})\\).
  The first one is a combination of the famous graph removal lemma in extremal
graph theory and a Johnson-type recursive inequality in coding theory, and the
second one is the probabilistic method.
  As a consequence, we obtain several intriguing upper bounds for some
parameters of \\(C(N,q,\\{w_1,\ldots,w_t\\})\\), which significantly improve the
previously known results.
