Suffix trees have emerged to be very fast for pattern searching yielding O
(m) time, where m is the pattern size. Unfortunately their high memory
requirements make it impractical to work with huge amounts of data. We present
a memory efficient algorithm of a generalized suffix tree which reduces the
space size by a factor of 10 when the size of the pattern is known beforehand.
Experiments on the chromosomes and Pizza&Chili corpus show significant
advantages of our algorithm over standard linear time suffix tree construction
in terms of memory usage for pattern searching.
