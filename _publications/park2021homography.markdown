Deep learning-based image retrieval has been emphasized in computer vision.
Representation embedding extracted by deep neural networks (DNNs) not only aims
at containing semantic information of the image, but also can manage
large-scale image retrieval tasks. In this work, we propose a deep
learning-based image retrieval approach using homography transformation
augmented contrastive learning to perform large-scale synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) image search tasks. Moreover, we propose a training method for the DNNs
induced by contrastive learning that does not require any labeling procedure.
This may enable tractability of large-scale datasets with relative ease.
Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed method by conducting
experiments on the polarimetric SAR image datasets.
