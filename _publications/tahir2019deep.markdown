Accurate localization of proteins from fluorescence microscopy images is
challenging due to the inter-class similarities and intra-class disparities
introducing grave concerns in addressing multi-class classification problems.
Conventional machine learning-based image prediction pipelines rely heavily on
pre-processing such as normalization and segmentation followed by hand-crafted
feature extraction to identify useful, informative, and application-specific
features. Here, we demonstrate that deep learning-based pipelines can
effectively classify protein images from different datasets. We propose an
end-to-end Protein Localization Convolutional Neural Network (PLCNN) that
classifies protein images more accurately and reliably. PLCNN processes raw
imagery without involving any pre-processing steps and produces outputs without
any customization or parameter adjustment for a particular dataset.
Experimental analysis is performed on five benchmark datasets. PLCNN
consistently outperformed the existing state-of-the-art approaches from
traditional machine learning and deep architectures. This study highlights the
importance of deep learning for the analysis of fluorescence microscopy protein
imagery. The proposed deep pipeline can better guide drug designing procedures
in the pharmaceutical industry and open new avenues for researchers in
computational biology and bioinformatics.
