    The concepts of overfitting and generalization are vital for evaluating machine learning models. In this work, we show that the popular Recall@K metric depends on the number of classes in the dataset, which limits its ability to estimate generalization. To fix this issue, we propose a new metric, which measures retrieval performance, and, unlike Recall@K, estimates generalization. We apply the proposed metric to popular image retrieval methods and provide new insights about deep metric learning generalization.
