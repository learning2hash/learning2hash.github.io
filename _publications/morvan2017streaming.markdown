<p>In this paper, we address the problem of learning compact
similarity-preserving embeddings for massive high-dimensional streams of
data in order to perform efficient similarity search. We present a new
online method for computing binary compressed representations -sketches-
of high-dimensional real feature vectors. Given an expected code length
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and high-dimensional input data
points, our algorithm provides a <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>-bits binary code for preserving the
distance between the points from the original high-dimensional space.
Our algorithm does not require neither the storage of the whole dataset
nor a chunk, thus it is fully adaptable to the streaming setting. It
also provides low time complexity and convergence guarantees. We
demonstrate the quality of our binary sketches through experiments on
real data for the nearest neighbors search task in the online
setting.</p>
