We propose a language-agnostic way of automatically generating sets of
semantically similar clusters of entities along with sets of "outlier"
elements, which may then be used to perform an intrinsic evaluation of word
embeddings in the outlier detection task. We used our methodology to create a
gold-standard dataset, which we call WikiSem500, and evaluated multiple
state-of-the-art embeddings. The results show a correlation between performance
on this dataset and performance on sentiment analysis.
