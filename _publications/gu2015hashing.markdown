Learning a hashing function for cross45;media search is very desirable due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. However the data crawled from Internet cannot always guarantee good correspondence among different modalities which affects the learning for hashing function. In this paper we focus on cross45;modal hashing with partially corresponded data. The data without full correspondence are made in use to enhance the hashing performance. The experiments on Wiki and NUS45;WIDE datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms some state45;of45;the45;art hashing approaches with fewer correspondence information.
