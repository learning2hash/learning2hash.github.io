Let X be a subset of a projective space, over a finite field K, which is
parameterized by the monomials arising from the edges of a clutter. Let I(X) be
the vanishing ideal of X. It is shown that I(X) is a complete intersection if
and only if X is a projective torus. In this case we determine the minimum
distance of any parameterized linear code arising from X.
