Extracting the relevant information out of a large number of documents is a
challenging and tedious task. The quality of results generated by the
traditionally available full-text search engine and text-based image retrieval
systems is not optimal. Information retrieval (IR) tasks become more
challenging with the nontraditional language scripts, as in the case of Indic
scripts. The authors have developed OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Search
Engine to make an Information Retrieval & Extraction (IRE) system that
replicates the current state-of-the-art methods using the IRE and Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Here we have presented the study of the
methods used for performing search and retrieval tasks. The details of this
system, along with the statistics of the dataset (source: National Digital
Library of India or NDLI), is also presented. Additionally, the ideas to
further explore and add value to research in IRE are also discussed.
