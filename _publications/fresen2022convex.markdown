Many star bodies have convex subsets with approximately the same Gaussian
measure (of the complement). Inspired by this phenomenon, and in connection
with the randomized Dvoretzky theorem for Lorentz spaces, we derive bounds on
the distribution of certain functions of a Gaussian random vector by
approximating their sub-level sets by convex subsets.
