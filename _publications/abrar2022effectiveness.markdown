Deep learning methods in the literature are commonly benchmarked on image
data sets, which may not be suitable or effective baselines for non-image
tabular data. In this paper, we take a data-centric view to perform one of the
first studies on deep embedding clustering of tabular data. Eight clustering
and state-of-the-art embedding clustering methods proposed for image data sets
are tested on seven tabular data sets. Our results reveal that a traditional
clustering method ranks second out of eight methods and is superior to most
deep embedding clustering baselines. Our observation aligns with the literature
that conventional machine learning of tabular data is still a robust approach
against deep learning. Therefore, state-of-the-art embedding clustering methods
should consider data-centric customization of learning architectures to become
competitive baselines for tabular data.
