Hashing methods have been recently found very effective in retrieval of
remote sensing (RS) images due to their computational efficiency and fast
search speed. The traditional hashing methods in RS usually exploit
hand-crafted features to learn hash functions to obtain binary codes, which can
be insufficient to optimally represent the information content of RS images. To
overcome this problem, in this paper we introduce a metric-learning based
hashing network, which learns: 1) a semantic-based metric space for effective
feature representation; and 2) compact binary hash codes for fast archive
search. Our network considers an interplay of multiple loss functions that
allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar
images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time
producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when
binarized. Experiments carried out on two benchmark RS archives point out that
the proposed network significantly improves the retrieval performance under the
same retrieval time when compared to the state-of-the-art hashing methods in
RS.
