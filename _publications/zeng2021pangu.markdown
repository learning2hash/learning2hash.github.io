Large-scale Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have become the new paradigm for Natural Language Processing (NLP). PLMs with hundreds of billions parameters such as GPT-3 have demonstrated strong performances on natural language understanding and generation with textitfew-shot in-context learning. In this work we present our practice on training large-scale autoregressive language models named PanGu-(alpha) with up to 200 billion parameters. PanGu-(alpha) is developed under the MindSpore and trained on a cluster of 2048 Ascend 910 AI processors. The training parallelism strategy is implemented based on MindSpore Auto-parallel which composes five parallelism dimensions to scale the training task to 2048 processors efficiently including data parallelism op-level model parallelism pipeline model parallelism optimizer model parallelism and rematerialization. To enhance the generalization ability of PanGu-(alpha) we collect 1.1TB high-quality Chinese data from a wide range of domains to pretrain the model. We empirically test the generation ability of PanGu-(alpha) in various scenarios including text summarization question answering dialogue generation etc. Moreover we investigate the effect of model scales on the few-shot performances across a broad range of Chinese NLP tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior capabilities of PanGu-(alpha) in performing various tasks under few-shot or zero-shot settings.
