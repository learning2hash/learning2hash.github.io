For a field \(\mathbb\{F\}\) and integers \(d\) and \(k\), a set of vectors of
\(\mathbb\{F\}^d\) is called \(k\)-nearly orthogonal if its members are
non-self-orthogonal and every \(k+1\) of them include an orthogonal pair. We
prove that for every prime \(p\) there exists a positive constant \(\delta =
\delta (p)\), such that for every field \(\mathbb\{F\}\) of characteristic \(p\) and
for all integers \(k \geq 2\) and \(d \geq k^\{1/(p-1)\}\), there exists a \(k\)-nearly
orthogonal set of at least \(d^\{\delta \cdot k^\{1/(p-1)\}/ log k\}\) vectors of
\(\mathbb\{F\}^d\). In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of
\(d^\{Ω( k /log k)\}\) vectors, and this is tight up to the \(log k\) term in
the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is
\(d^\{Ω( log k / log log k)\}\) (Alon and Szegedy, Graphs and Combin.,
1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.
