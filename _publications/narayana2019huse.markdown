There is a recent surge of interest in cross-modal representation learning
corresponding to images and text. The main challenge lies in mapping images and
text to a shared latent space where the embeddings corresponding to a similar
semantic concept lie closer to each other than the embeddings corresponding to
different semantic concepts, irrespective of the modality. Ranking losses are
commonly used to create such shared latent space -- however, they do not impose
any constraints on inter-class relationships resulting in neighboring clusters
to be completely unrelated. The works in the domain of visual semantic
embeddings address this problem by first constructing a semantic embedding
space based on some external knowledge and projecting image embeddings onto
this fixed semantic embedding space. These works are confined only to image
domain and constraining the embeddings to a fixed space adds additional burden
on learning. This paper proposes a novel method, HUSE, to learn cross-modal
representation with semantic information. HUSE learns a shared latent space
where the distance between any two universal embeddings is similar to the
distance between their corresponding class embeddings in the semantic embedding
space. HUSE also uses a classification objective with a shared classification
layer to make sure that the image and text embeddings are in the same shared
latent space. Experiments on UPMC Food-101 show our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art on retrieval, hierarchical precision and classification
results.
