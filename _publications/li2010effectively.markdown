The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a knowledge base to effectively describe
proteins. However, measuring similarity between proteins based on GO remains a
challenge. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, information
coefficient similarity measure (SimIC), to effectively integrate both the
information content (IC) of GO terms and the structural information of GO
hierarchy to determine the similarity between proteins. Testing on yeast
proteins, our results show that SimIC efficiently addresses the shallow
annotation issue in GO, thus improves the correlations between GO similarities
of yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between GO
similarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the proposed SimIC is superior in predicting yeast protein
interactions. We predict 20484 yeast protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
between 2462 proteins based on the high SimIC values of biological process (BP)
and cellular component (CC). Examining the 214 MIPS complexes in our predicted
PPIs shows that all members of 159 MIPS complexes can be found in our PPI
predictions, which is more than those (120/214) found in PPIs predicted by
relative specificity similarity (RSS). Integrating IC and structural
information of GO hierarchy can improve the effectiveness of the semantic
similarity measure of GO terms. The new SimIC can effectively correct the
effect of shallow annotation, and then provide an effective way to measure
similarity between proteins based on Gene Ontology.
