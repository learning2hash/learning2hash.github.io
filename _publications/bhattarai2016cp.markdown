We propose a novel Coupled Projection multi-task Metric Learning (CP-mtML)
method for large scale face retrieval. In contrast to previous works which were
limited to low dimensional features and small datasets, the proposed method
scales to large datasets with high dimensional face descriptors. It utilises
pairwise (dis-)similarity constraints as supervision and hence does not require
exhaustive class annotation for every training image. While, traditionally,
multi-task learning methods have been validated on same dataset but different
tasks, we work on the more challenging setting with heterogeneous datasets and
different tasks. We show empirical validation on multiple face image datasets
of different facial traits, e.g. identity, age and expression. We use classic
Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors along with the recent Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) features. The experiments clearly demonstrate the
scalability and improved performance of the proposed method on the tasks of
identity and age based face image retrieval compared to competitive existing
methods, on the standard datasets and with the presence of a million distractor
face images.
