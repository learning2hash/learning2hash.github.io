Music genre classification is one of the trending topics in regards to the
current Music Information Retrieval (MIR) Research. Since, the dependency of
genre is not only limited to the audio profile, we also make use of textual
content provided as lyrics of the corresponding song. We implemented a CNN
based feature extractor for spectrograms in order to incorporate the acoustic
features and a Hierarchical Attention Network based feature extractor for
lyrics. We then go on to classify the music track based upon the resulting
fused feature vector.
