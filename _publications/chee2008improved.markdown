The design of large libraries of oligonucleotides having constant GC-content
and satisfying Hamming distance constraints between oligonucleotides and their
Watson-Crick complements is important in reducing hybridization errors in DNA
computing, DNA microarray technologies, and molecular bar coding. Various
techniques have been studied for the construction of such oligonucleotide
libraries, ranging from algorithmic constructions via stochastic local search
to theoretical constructions via coding theory. We introduce a new stochastic
local search method which yields improvements up to more than one third of the
benchmark lower bounds of Gaborit and King (2005) for n-mer oligonucleotide
libraries when n <= 14. We also found several optimal libraries by computing
maximum cliques on certain graphs.
