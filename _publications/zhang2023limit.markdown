Let \(\\{X_n;n\ge 1\\}\) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed
random variables in a regular sub-linear expectation space
\((Î©,\mathscr\{H\},\widehat\{\mathbb E\})\) with the finite Choquet expectation,
upper mean \(\overline\{\mu\} \) and lower mean \(\underline\{\mu\} \). Then for any
Borel-measurable function \(\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_d)\) on \(\mathbb R^d\) or
continuous function \(\varphi(x_1,x_2,\ldots)\) on \(\mathbb R^\{\mathbb N\}\),
\(\sum_\{i=1\}^n X_i/n\) converges to \(\underline\{\mu\}\wedge
\varphi(X_1,X_2,\ldots)\wedge \overline\{\mu\}\) with upper capacity \(1\). The
limits of \(\sum_\{i=1\}^nX_i/n\) can be with upper capacity 1 also a random set
with boundaries being continuous functions or finite-dimensional
Borel-measurable functions of \((X_1, X_2,\ldots)\).
