Graph convolution networks (GCN), which recently becomes new state-of-the-art
method for graph node classification, recommendation and other applications,
has not been successfully applied to industrial-scale search engine yet. In
this proposal, we introduce our approach, namely SearchGCN, for embedding-based
candidate retrieval in one of the largest e-commerce search engine in the
world. Empirical studies demonstrate that SearchGCN learns better embedding
representations than existing methods, especially for long tail queries and
items. Thus, SearchGCN has been deployed into JD.com's search production since
July 2020.
