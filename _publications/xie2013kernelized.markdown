Large scale agglomerative clustering is hindered by computational burdens. We
propose a novel scheme where exact inter-instance distance calculation is
replaced by the Hamming distance between Kernelized Locality-Sensitive Hashing
(KLSH) hashed values. This results in a method that drastically decreases
computation time. Additionally, we take advantage of certain labeled data points
via distance metric learning to achieve a competitive precision and recall
comparing to K-Means but in much less computation time.
