Large scale agglomerative clustering is hindered by computational burdens. We propose a novel scheme where exact inter45;instance distance calculation is replaced by the Hamming distance between Kernelized Locality45;Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) hashed values. This results in a method that drastically decreases computation time. Additionally we take advantage of certain labeled data points via distance metric learning to achieve a competitive precision and recall comparing to K45;Means but in much less computation time.
