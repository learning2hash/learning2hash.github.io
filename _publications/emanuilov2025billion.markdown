This paper presents a novel approach for similarity search with complex
filtering capabilities on billion-scale datasets, optimized for CPU inference.
Our method extends the classical IVF-Flat index structure to integrate
multi-dimensional filters. The proposed algorithm combines dense embeddings
with discrete filtering attributes, enabling fast retrieval in high-dimensional
spaces. Designed specifically for CPU-based systems, our disk-based approach
offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale similarity search. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study, showcasing
its potential for various practical uses.
