<p>We present an I/O-efficient algorithm for computing similarity joins
based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). In contrast to the filtering
methods commonly suggested our method has provable sub-quadratic
dependency on the data size. Further, in contrast to straightforward
implementations of known LSH-based algorithms on external memory, our
approach is able to take significant advantage of the available internal
memory: Whereas the time complexity of classical algorithms includes a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(N^\rho\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a parameter of the LSH used, the
I/O complexity of our algorithm merely includes a factor <span
class="math inline">\((N/M)^\rho\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the data size and <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the size of internal memory. Our
algorithm is randomized and outputs the correct result with high
probability. It is a simple, recursive, cache-oblivious procedure, and
we believe that it will be useful also in other computational settings
such as parallel computation.</p>
