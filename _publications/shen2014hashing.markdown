Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving the Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques in contrast are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high45;dimensional data. The complexities of these models and the problems with out45;of45;sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large45;scale embedding however. In this work how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order to address the above45;mentioned difficulties an efficient inductive solution to the out45;of45;sample data problem and a process by which non45;parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of t45;SNE outperforms state45;of45;the45;art hashing methods on large45;scale benchmark datasets and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved for example by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal rotations. In addition a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is developed by incorporating the label information which is shown to greatly advance the semantic retrieval performance.
