In this paper we determine the minimum distance of orthogonal line-Grassmann
codes for \\(q\\) even. The case \\(q\\) odd was solved in "I. Cardinali, L. Giuzzi, K.
Kaipa, A. Pasini, Line Polar Grassmann Codes of Orthogonal Type, J. Pure
Applied Algebra."
  We also show that for \\(q\\) even all minimum weight codewords are equivalent
and that symplectic line-Grassmann codes are proper subcodes of codimension
\\(2n\\) of the orthogonal ones.
