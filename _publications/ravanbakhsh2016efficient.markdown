In this paper we introduce a novel method for segmentation that can benefit
from general semantics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our segmentation
proposes visually and semantically coherent image segments. We use binary
encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of the clustering on the
high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary encoding can be embedded into
the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the network. This results in real-time
segmentation. To the best of our knowledge our method is the first attempt on
general semantic image segmentation using CNN. All the previous papers were
limited to few number of category of the images (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Experiments
show that our segmentation algorithm outperform the state-of-the-art
non-semantic segmentation methods by a large margin.
