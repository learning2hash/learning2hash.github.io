The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work we introduce R-Bench a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations relationship-relationship subject-relationship and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning datasets long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.
