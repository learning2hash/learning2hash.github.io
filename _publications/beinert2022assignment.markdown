Let \\(x_1 < \dots < x_n\\) and \\(y_1 < \dots < y_n\\), \\(n \in \mathbb N\\), be real
numbers. We show by an example that the assignment problem $\\( \max_\{\sigma \in
S_n\} F_\sigma(x,y) := \frac12 \sum_\{i,k=1\}^n |x_i - x_k|^\alpha \,
|y_\{\sigma(i)\} - y_\{\sigma(k)\}|^\alpha, \quad \alpha >0, \\)\\( is in general
neither solved by the identical permutation (id) nor the anti-identical
permutation (a-id) if \\)n > 2 +2^\alpha\\(. Indeed the above maximum can be,
depending on the number of points, arbitrary far away from \\)F_\text\{id\}(x,y)\\(
and \\)F_\text\{a-id\}(x,y)$. The motivation to deal with such assignment problems
came from their relation to Gromov-Wasserstein divergences which have recently
attained a lot of attention.
