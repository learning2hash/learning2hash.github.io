In this paper, we explore the intersection of technology and cultural
preservation by developing a self-supervised learning framework for the
classification of musical symbols in historical manuscripts. Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) plays a vital role in digitising and preserving musical
heritage, but historical documents often lack the labelled data required by
traditional methods. We overcome this challenge by training a neural-based
feature extractor on unlabelled data, enabling effective classification with
minimal samples. Key contributions include optimising crop preprocessing for a
self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network and evaluating classification
methods, including SVM, multilayer perceptrons, and prototypical networks. Our
experiments yield an accuracy of 87.66%, showcasing the potential of AI-driven
methods to ensure the survival of historical music for future generations
through advanced digital archiving techniques.
