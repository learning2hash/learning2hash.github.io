In this paper a framework to study the dual of skew cyclic codes is proposed.
The transposed Hamming ring extensions are based in the existence of an
anti-isomorphism of algebras between skew polynomial rings. Our construction is
applied to left ideal convolutional codes, skew constacyclic codes and skew
Reed-Solomon code, showing that the dual of these codes belong to the same
class.
