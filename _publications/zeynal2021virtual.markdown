Online shopping has gained popularity recently. This paper addresses one
crucial problem of buying dress online, which has not been solved yet. This
research tries to implement the idea of clothes swapping with the help of
DeepFashion dataset where 6,223 images with eight landmarks each used. Deep
Convolutional Neural Network has been built for Landmark detection.
