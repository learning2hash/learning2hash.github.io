People are able to detect up to 1 trillion odors. Yet, city planning is
concerned only with a few bad odors, mainly because odors are currently
captured only through complaints made by urban dwellers. To capture both good
and bad odors, we resort to a methodology that has been recently proposed and
relies on tagging information of geo-referenced pictures. In doing so for the
cities of London and Barcelona, this work makes three new contributions. We
study 1) how the urban smellscape changes in time and space; 2) which emotions
people share at places with specific smells; and 3) what is the color of a
smell, if it exists. Without social media data, insights about those three
aspects have been difficult to produce in the past, further delaying the
creation of urban restorative experiences.
