Data similarity is a key concept in many data-driven applications. Many
algorithms are sensitive to similarity measures. To tackle this fundamental
problem, automatically learning of similarity information from data via
self-expression has been developed and successfully applied in various models,
such as low-rank representation, sparse subspace learning, semi-supervised
learning. However, it just tries to reconstruct the original data and some
valuable information, e.g., the manifold structure, is largely ignored. In this
paper, we argue that it is beneficial to preserve the overall relations when we
extract similarity information. Specifically, we propose a novel similarity
learning framework by minimizing the reconstruction error of kernel matrices,
rather than the reconstruction error of original data adopted by existing work.
Taking the clustering task as an example to evaluate our method, we observe
considerable improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. More
importantly, our proposed framework is very general and provides a novel and
fundamental building block for many other similarity-based tasks. Besides, our
proposed kernel preserving opens up a large number of possibilities to embed
high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space.
