The field of computational linguistics constantly presents new challenges and
topics for research. Whether it be analyzing word usage changes over time or
identifying relationships between pairs of seemingly unrelated words. To this
point, we identify Anagrams and Antigrams as words possessing such unique
properties. The presented work is an exploration into generating anagrams from
a given word and determining whether there exists antigram (semantically
opposite anagrams) relationships between the pairs of generated anagrams using
GloVe embeddings. We propose a rudimentary, yet interpretable, rule-based
algorithm for detecting antigrams. On a small dataset of just 12 antigrams, our
approach yielded an accuracy of 39% which shows that there is much work left
to be done in this space.
