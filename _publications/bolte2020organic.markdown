Storyline visualizations display the interactions of groups and entities and
their development over time. Existing approaches have successfully adopted the
general layout from hand-drawn illustrations to automatically create similar
depictions. Ward Shelley is the author of several diagrammatic paintings that
show the timeline of art-related subjects, such as Downtown Body, a history of
art scenes. His drawings include many stylistic elements that are not covered
by existing storyline visualizations, like links between entities, splits and
merges of streams, and tags or labels to describe the individual elements. We
present a visualization method that provides a visual mapping for the complex
relationships in the data, creates a layout for their display, and adopts a
similar styling of elements to imitate the artistic appeal of such
illustrations. We compare our results to the original drawings and provide an
open-source authoring tool prototype.
