Compacted Dither Pattern Code (CDPC) is a recently found feature which is
successful in irregular shapes based visual depiction. Locally salient dither
pattern feature is an attempt to expand the capability of CDPC for both regular
and irregular shape based visual depiction. This paper presents an analysis of
rotational and scale invariance property of locally salient dither pattern
feature with a two dimensional spatialchromatic histogram, which expands the
applicability of the visual feature. Experiments were conducted to exhibit
rotational and scale invariance of the feature. These experiments were
conducted by combining linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to the
new feature. The experimental results revealed that the locally salient dither
pattern feature with the spatialchromatic histogram is rotationally and scale
invariant.
