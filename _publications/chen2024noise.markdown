Motivated by applications in spatial genomics, we revisit group testing
(Dorfman~1943) and propose the class of \(\lambda\)-\{\sf ADD\}-codes, studying
such codes with certain distance \(d\) and codelength \(n\). When \(d\) is constant,
we provide explicit code constructions with rates close to \(1/2\). When \(d\) is
proportional to \(n\), we provide a GV-type lower bound whose rates are
efficiently computable. Upper bounds for such codes are also studied.
