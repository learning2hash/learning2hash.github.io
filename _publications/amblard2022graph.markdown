This paper presents how the online tool GREW-MATCH can be used to make
queries and visualise data from existing semantically annotated corpora. A
dedicated syntax is available to construct simple to complex queries and
execute them against a corpus. Such queries give transverse views of the
annotated data, these views can help for checking the consistency of
annotations in one corpus or across several corpora. GREW-MATCH can then be
seen as an error mining tool: when inconsistencies are detected, it helps
finding the sentences which should be fixed. Finally, GREW-MATCH can also be
used as a side tool to assist annotation tasks helping to find annotation
examples in existing corpora to be compared to the data to be annotated.
