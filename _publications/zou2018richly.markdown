We contribute the first large-scale dataset of scene sketches, SketchyScene,
with the goal of advancing research on sketch understanding at both the object
and scene level. The dataset is created through a novel and carefully designed
crowdsourcing pipeline, enabling users to efficiently generate large quantities
of realistic and diverse scene sketches. SketchyScene contains more than 29,000
scene-level sketches, 7,000+ pairs of scene templates and photos, and 11,000+
object sketches. All objects in the scene sketches have ground-truth semantic
and instance masks. The dataset is also highly scalable and extensible, easily
allowing augmenting and/or changing scene composition. We demonstrate the
potential impact of SketchyScene by training new computational models for
semantic segmentation of scene sketches and showing how the new dataset enables
several applications including image retrieval, sketch colorization, editing,
and captioning, etc. The dataset and code can be found at
