Jaccard similarity is widely used as a distance measure in many machine learning and search applications. Typically hashing methods are essential for the use of Jaccard similarity to be practical in large45;scale settings. For hashing binary (0/1) data the idea of one permutation hashing (OPH) with densification significantly accelerates traditional minwise hashing algorithms while providing unbiased and accurate estimates. In this paper we propose a strategy named re45;randomization in the process of densification that could achieve the smallest variance among all densification schemes. The success of this idea naturally inspires us to generalize one permutation hashing to weighted (non45;binary) data which results in the socalled bin45;wise consistent weighted sampling (BCWS) algorithm. We analyze the behavior of BCWS and compare it with a recent alternative. Extensive experiments on various datasets illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.
