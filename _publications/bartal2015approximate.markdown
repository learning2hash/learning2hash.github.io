While the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search has been
well-studied for Euclidean space and \\(\ell_1\\), few non-trivial algorithms are
known for \\(\ell_p\\) when (\\(2 < p < \infty\\)). In this paper, we revisit this
fundamental problem and present approximate nearest-neighbor search algorithms
which give the first non-trivial approximation factor guarantees in this
setting.
