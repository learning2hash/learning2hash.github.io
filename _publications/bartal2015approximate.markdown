While the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search has been well-studied for Euclidean space and \ell_1 few non-trivial algorithms are known for \ell_p when (2 < p < \infty). In this paper we revisit this fundamental problem and present approximate nearest-neighbor search algorithms which give the first non-trivial approximation factor guarantees in this setting.
