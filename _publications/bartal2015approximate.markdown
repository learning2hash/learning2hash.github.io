While the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search has been well-studied for Euclidean space and \(\ell_1\), few non-trivial algorithms are known for \(\ell_p\) when (\(2 < p < \infty\)). In this paper, we revisit this fundamental problem and present approximate nearest-neighbor search algorithms which give the first non-trivial approximation factor guarantees in this setting.
