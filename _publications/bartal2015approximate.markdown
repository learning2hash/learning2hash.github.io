<p>While the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search has been
well-studied for Euclidean space and <span
class="math inline">\(\ell_1\)</span>, few non-trivial algorithms are
known for <span class="math inline">\(\ell_p\)</span> when (<span
class="math inline">\(2 &lt; p &lt; \infty\)</span>). In this paper, we
revisit this fundamental problem and present approximate
nearest-neighbor search algorithms which give the first non-trivial
approximation factor guarantees in this setting.</p>
