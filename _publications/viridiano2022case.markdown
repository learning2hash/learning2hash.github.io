This paper argues in favor of the adoption of annotation practices for
multimodal datasets that recognize and represent the inherently perspectivized
nature of multimodal communication. To support our claim, we present a set of
annotation experiments in which FrameNet annotation is applied to the Multi30k
and the Flickr 30k Entities datasets. We assess the cosine similarity between
the semantic representations derived from the annotation of both pictures and
captions for frames. Our findings indicate that: (i) frame semantic similarity
between captions of the same picture produced in different languages is
sensitive to whether the caption is a translation of another caption or not,
and (ii) picture annotation for semantic frames is sensitive to whether the
image is annotated in presence of a caption or not.
