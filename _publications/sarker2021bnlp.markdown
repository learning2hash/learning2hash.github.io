BNLP is an open source language processing toolkit for Bengali language
consisting with tokenization, word embedding, POS tagging, NER tagging
facilities. BNLP provides pre-trained model with high accuracy to do model
based tokenization, embedding, POS tagging, NER tagging task for Bengali
language. BNLP pre-trained model achieves significant results in Bengali text
tokenization, word embedding, POS tagging and NER tagging task. BNLP is using
widely in the Bengali research communities with 16K downloads, 119 stars and 31
forks. BNLP is available at https://github.com/sagorbrur/bnlp.
