A Z2Z4-additive code C is called cyclic if the set of coordinates can be
partitioned into two subsets, the set of Z_2 and the set of Z_4 coordinates,
such that any cyclic shift of the coordinates of both subsets leaves the code
invariant. We study the binary images of Z2Z4-additive cyclic codes. We
determine all Z2Z4-additive cyclic codes with odd beta whose Gray images are
linear binary codes.
