We present a framework based on conditional entropy and the Dirichlet
distribution for classifying chromosomes based on the degree to which they use
synonymous codons uniformly or preferentially, that is, whether or not codons
that code for an amino acid appear with the same relative frequency. Applying
the approach to a large collection of annotated bacterial chromosomes reveals
three distinct groups of bacteria.
