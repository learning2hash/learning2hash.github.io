In this paper, we study \\(w\\)-frameproof codes, which are equivalent to
\\(\\{1,w\\}\\)-separating hash families. Our main results concern binary codes,
which are defined over an alphabet of two symbols. For all \\(w \geq 3\\), and for
\\(w+1 \leq N \leq 3w\\), we show that an \\(SHF(N; n,2, \\{1,w \\})\\) exists only if \\(n
\leq N\\), and an \\(SHF(N; N,2, \\{1,w \\})\\) must be a permutation matrix of degree
\\(N\\).
