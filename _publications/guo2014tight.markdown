In this paper we study w45;frameproof codes which are equivalent to 123;1w125;45;separating hash families. Our main results concern binary codes which are defined over an alphabet of two symbols. For all w ≥ 3 and for w+1 ≤ N ≤ 3w we show that an SHF(N; n2 123;1w 125;) exists only if n ≤ N and an SHF(N; N2 123;1w 125;) must be a permutation matrix of degree N.
