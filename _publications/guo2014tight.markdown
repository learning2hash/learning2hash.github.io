<p>In this paper, we study <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>-frameproof codes, which are equivalent
to <span class="math inline">\(\{1,w\}\)</span>-separating hash
families. Our main results concern binary codes, which are defined over
an alphabet of two symbols. For all <span class="math inline">\(w \geq
3\)</span>, and for <span class="math inline">\(w+1 \leq N \leq
3w\)</span>, we show that an <span class="math inline">\(SHF(N; n,2,
\{1,w \})\)</span> exists only if <span class="math inline">\(n
\leq N\)</span>, and an <span class="math inline">\(SHF(N; N,2, \{1,w
\})\)</span> must be a permutation matrix of degree <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
