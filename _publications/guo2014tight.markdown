In this paper, we study \\(w\\)-frameproof codes, which are equivalent to \\(\&#123;1,w\&#125;\\)-separating hash families. Our main results concern binary codes, which are defined over an alphabet of two symbols. For all \\(w \geq 3\\), and for \\(w+1 \leq N \leq 3w\\), we show that an \\(SHF(N; n,2, \&#123;1,w \&#125;)\\) exists only if $n \leq N\\(, and an \\)SHF(N; N,2, \{1,w \})$ must be a permutation matrix of degree \\(N\\).
