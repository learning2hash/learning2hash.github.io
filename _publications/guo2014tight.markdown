In this paper, we study \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-frameproof codes, which are equivalent to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\{1,w\\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-separating hash families. Our main results concern binary codes, which are defined over an alphabet of two symbols. For all \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w \geq 3\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w+1 \leq N \leq 3w\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, we show that an \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(SHF(N; n,2, \\{1,w \\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} exists only if $n \leq N\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(, and an \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}SHF(N; N,2, \\{1,w \\})$ must be a permutation matrix of degree \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(N\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
