<p>Efficient indexing and searching of high dimensional data has been an
area of active research due to the growing exploitation of high
dimensional data and the vulnerability of traditional search methods to
the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a new approach for fast
and effective searching and indexing of high dimensional features using
random partitions of the feature space. Experiments on both handwritten
digits and 3-D shape descriptors have shown the proposed algorithm to be
highly effective and efficient in indexing and searching real data sets
of several hundred dimensions. We also compare its performance to that
of the state-of-the-art locality sensitive hashing algorithm.</p>
