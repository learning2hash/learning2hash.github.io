How to find places that are not indexed by Google Maps? We propose an
intuitive method and framework to locate places based on their distinctive
spatial features. The method uses satellite and street view images in machine
vision approaches to classify locations. If we can classify locations, we just
need to repeat for non-overlapping locations in our area of interest. We assess
the proposed system in finding Parkour spots in the campus of Arizona State
University. The results are very satisfactory, having found more than 25 new
Parkour spots, with a rate of true positives above 60%.
