The New Yorker publishes a weekly captionless cartoon. More than 5,000
readers submit captions for it. The editors select three of them and ask the
readers to pick the funniest one. We describe an experiment that compares a
dozen automatic methods for selecting the funniest caption. We show that
negative sentiment, human-centeredness, and lexical centrality most strongly
match the funniest captions, followed by positive sentiment. These results are
useful for understanding humor and also in the design of more engaging
conversational agents in text and multimodal (vision+text) systems. As part of
this work, a large set of cartoons and captions is being made available to the
community.
