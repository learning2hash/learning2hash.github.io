Feature representation in the form of spatio-spectral decomposition is one of
the robust techniques adopted in automatic handwritten character recognition
systems. In this regard, we propose a new image representation approach for
unconstrained handwritten alphanumeric characters using sparse concept coded
Tetrolets. Tetrolets, which does not use fixed dyadic square blocks for
spectral decomposition like conventional wavelets, preserve the localized
variations in handwritings by adopting tetrominoes those capture the shape
geometry. The sparse concept coding of low entropy Tetrolet representation is
found to extract the important hidden information (concept) for superior
pattern discrimination. Large scale experimentation using ten databases in six
different scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, English, Arabic and Telugu) has
been performed. The proposed feature representation along with standard
classifiers such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM), nearest
neighbor and modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) is found to
achieve state-of-the-art recognition performance in all the databases, viz.
99.40% (MNIST); 98.72% and 93.24% (IITBBS); 99.38% and 99.22% (ISI Kolkata).
The proposed OCR system is shown to perform better than other sparse based
techniques such as PCA, SparsePCA and SparseLDA, as well as better than
existing transforms (Wavelet, Slantlet and Stockwell).
