Many social network applications depend on robust representations of
spatio-temporal data. In this work, we present an embedding model based on
feed-forward neural networks which transforms social media check-ins into dense
feature vectors encoding geographic, temporal, and functional aspects for
modelling places, neighborhoods, and users. We employ the embedding model in a
variety of applications including location recommendation, urban functional
zone study, and crime prediction. For location recommendation, we propose a
Spatio-Temporal Embedding Similarity algorithm (STES) based on the embedding
model.
  In a range of experiments on real life data collected from Foursquare, we
demonstrate our model's effectiveness at characterizing places and people and
its applicability in aforementioned problem domains. Finally, we select eight
major cities around the globe and verify the robustness and generality of our
model by porting pre-trained models from one city to another, thereby
alleviating the need for costly local training.
