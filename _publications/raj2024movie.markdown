In today's digital world, streaming platforms offer a vast array of movies,
making it hard for users to find content matching their preferences. This paper
explores integrating real time data from popular movie websites using advanced
HTML scraping techniques and APIs. It also incorporates a recommendation system
trained on a static Kaggle dataset, enhancing the relevance and freshness of
suggestions. By combining content based filtering, collaborative filtering, and
a hybrid model, we create a system that utilizes both historical and real time
data for more personalized suggestions. Our methodology shows that
incorporating dynamic data not only boosts user satisfaction but also aligns
recommendations with current viewing trends.
