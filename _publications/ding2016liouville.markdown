Let \\(\\{\eta(v): v\in V_N\\}\\) be a discrete Gaussian free field in a
two-dimensional box \\(V_N\\) of side length \\(N\\) with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We study the Liouville first passage percolation, i.e., the
shortest path metric where each vertex is given a weight of \\(e^\{\gamma
\eta(v)\}\\) for some \\(\gamma>0\\). We show that for sufficiently small but fixed
\\(\gamma>0\\), with probability tending to \\(1\\) as \\(N\to \infty\\), all geodesics
between vertices of macroscopic Euclidean distances simultaneously have (the
conjecturally unique) length exponent strictly larger than 1.
