In this paper, we present our work to support publishers and editors in
finding descriptive tags for e-books through tag recommendations. We propose a
hybrid tag recommendation system for e-books, which leverages search query
terms from Amazon users and e-book metadata, which is assigned by publishers
and editors. Our idea is to mimic the vocabulary of users in Amazon, who search
for and review e-books, and to combine these search terms with editor tags in a
hybrid tag recommendation approach. In total, we evaluate 19 tag recommendation
algorithms on the review content of Amazon users, which reflects the readers'
vocabulary. Our results show that we can improve the performance of tag
recommender systems for e-books both concerning tag recommendation accuracy,
diversity as well as a novel semantic similarity metric, which we also propose
in this paper.
