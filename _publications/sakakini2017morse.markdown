We present in this paper a novel framework for morpheme segmentation which
uses the morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in
addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. This
framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic
information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies of available
benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the
basis of compositionality. We validate our algorithm across datasets and
present state-of-the-art results.
