Deploying state-of-the-art CNNs requires power-hungry processors and off-chip memory. This precludes the implementation of CNNs in low-power embedded systems. Recent research shows CNNs sustain extreme quantization binarizing their weights and intermediate feature maps thereby saving 8-32x memory and collapsing energy-intensive sum-of-products into XNOR-and-popcount operations. We present XNORBIN an accelerator for binary CNNs with computation tightly coupled to memory for aggressive data reuse. Implemented in UMC 65nm technology XNORBIN achieves an energy efficiency of 95 TOp/s/W and an area efficiency of 2.0 TOp/s/MGE at 0.8 V.
