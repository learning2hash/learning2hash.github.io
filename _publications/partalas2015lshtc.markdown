LSHTC is a series of challenges which aims to assess the performance of
classification systems in large-scale classification in a a large number of
classes (up to hundreds of thousands). This paper describes the dataset that
have been released along the LSHTC series. The paper details the construction
of the datsets and the design of the tracks as well as the evaluation measures
that we implemented and a quick overview of the results. All of these datasets
are available online and runs may still be submitted on the online server of
the challenges.
