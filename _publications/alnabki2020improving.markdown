Name entity recognition in noisy user-generated texts is a difficult task
usually enhanced by incorporating an external resource of information, such as
gazetteers. However, gazetteers are task-specific, and they are expensive to
build and maintain. This paper adopts and improves the approach of Aguilar et
al. by presenting a novel feature, called Local Distance Neighbor, which
substitutes gazetteers. We tested the new approach on the W-NUT-2017 dataset,
obtaining state-of-the-art results for the Group, Person and Product categories
of Named Entities. Next, we added 851 manually labeled samples to the
W-NUT-2017 dataset to account for named entities in the Tor Darknet related to
weapons and drug selling. Finally, our proposal achieved an entity and surface
F1 scores of 52.96% and 50.57% on this extended dataset, demonstrating its
usefulness for Law Enforcement Agencies to detect named entities in the Tor
hidden services.
