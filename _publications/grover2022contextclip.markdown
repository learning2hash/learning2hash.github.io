State-of-the-art empirical work has shown that visual representations learned
by deep neural networks are robust in nature and capable of performing
classification tasks on diverse datasets. For example, CLIP demonstrated
zero-shot transfer performance on multiple datasets for classification tasks in
a joint embedding space of image and text pairs. However, it showed negative
transfer performance on standard datasets, e.g., BirdsNAP, RESISC45, and MNIST.
In this paper, we propose ContextCLIP, a contextual and contrastive learning
framework for the contextual alignment of image-text pairs by learning robust
visual representations on Conceptual Captions dataset. Our framework was
observed to improve the image-text alignment by aligning text and image
representations contextually in the joint embedding space. ContextCLIP showed
good qualitative performance for text-to-image retrieval tasks and enhanced
classification accuracy. We evaluated our model quantitatively with zero-shot
transfer and fine-tuning experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Birdsnap,
RESISC45, and MNIST datasets for classification task.
