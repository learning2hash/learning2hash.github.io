We present DeepExpr, a novel expression transfer system from humans to
multiple stylized characters via deep learning. We developed : 1) a data-driven
perceptual model of facial expressions, 2) a novel stylized character data set
with cardinal expression annotations : FERG (Facial Expression Research Group)
- DB (added two new characters), and 3) . We evaluated our method on a set of
retrieval tasks on our collected stylized character dataset of expressions. We
have also shown that the ranking order predicted by the proposed features is
highly correlated with the ranking order provided by a facial expression expert
and Mechanical Turk (MT) experiments.
