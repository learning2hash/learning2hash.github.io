We propose a method for efficiently finding all parallel passages in a large
corpus, even if the passages are not quite identical due to rephrasing and
orthographic variation. The key ideas are the representation of each word in
the corpus by its two most infrequent letters, finding matched pairs of strings
of four or five words that differ by at most one word and then identifying
clusters of such matched pairs. Using this method, over 4600 parallel pairs of
passages were identified in the Babylonian Talmud, a Hebrew-Aramaic corpus of
over 1.8 million words, in just over 30 seconds. Empirical comparisons on
sample data indicate that the coverage obtained by our method is essentially
the same as that obtained using slow exhaustive methods.
