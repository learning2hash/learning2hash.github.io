Lower and upper bounds are explored for the uniform (Kolmogorov) and
\(L^2\)-distances between the distributions of weighted sums of dependent
summands and the normal law. The results are illustrated for several classes of
random variables whose joint distributions are supported on Euclidean spheres.
We also survey several results on improved rates of normal approximation in
randomized central limit theorems.
