Regularities in strings are often related to periods and covers, which have
extensively been studied, and algorithms for their efficient computation have
broad application. In this paper we concentrate on computing cyclic
regularities of strings, in particular, we propose several efficient algorithms
for computing: (i) cyclic periodicity; (ii) all cyclic periodicity; (iii)
maximal local cyclic periodicity; (iv) cyclic covers.
