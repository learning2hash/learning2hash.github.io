In this note, we obtain the growth order of Lebesgue constants for Fekete
points associated with tensor powers of a positive line bundle. Moreover, by
endowing the space of global holomorphic sections with a natural Gaussian
probability measure we prove that Fekete points are sampling for random
holomorphic sections.
