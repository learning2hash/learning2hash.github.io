In this work, we address the problem of audio-based near-duplicate video
retrieval. We propose the Audio Similarity Learning (AuSiL) approach that
effectively captures temporal patterns of audio similarity between video pairs.
For the robust similarity calculation between two videos, we first extract
representative audio-based video descriptors by leveraging transfer learning
based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large scale dataset
of audio events, and then we calculate the similarity matrix derived from the
pairwise similarity of these descriptors. The similarity matrix is subsequently
fed to a CNN network that captures the temporal structures existing within its
content. We train our network following a triplet generation process and
optimizing the triplet loss function. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, we have manually annotated two publicly available video
datasets based on the audio duplicity between their videos. The proposed
approach achieves very competitive results compared to three state-of-the-art
methods. Also, unlike the competing methods, it is very robust to the retrieval
of audio duplicates generated with speed transformations.
