Mobile dating apps have become a popular means to meet potential partners.
Although several exist, one recent addition stands out amongst all others.
Tinder presents its users with pictures of people geographically nearby, whom
they can either like or dislike based on first impressions. If two users like
each other, they are allowed to initiate a conversation via the chat feature.
In this paper we use a set of curated profiles to explore the behaviour of men
and women in Tinder. We reveal differences between the way men and women
interact with the app, highlighting the strategies employed. Women attain large
numbers of matches rapidly, whilst men only slowly accumulate matches. To
expand on our findings, we collect survey data to understand user intentions on
Tinder. Most notably, our results indicate that a little effort in grooming
profiles, especially for male users, goes a long way in attracting attention.
