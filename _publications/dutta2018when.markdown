<p>Carpooling, or sharing a ride with other passengers, holds immense
potential for urban transportation. Ridesharing platforms enable such
sharing of rides using real-time data. Finding ride matches in real-time
at urban scale is a difficult combinatorial optimization task and mostly
heuristic approaches are applied. In this work, we mathematically model
the problem as that of finding near-neighbors and devise a novel
efficient spatio-temporal search algorithm based on the theory of
locality sensitive hashing for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). The
proposed algorithm can find <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
near-optimal potential matches for every ride from a pool of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rides in time <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^{1 + \rho} (k +
\log n) \log k)\)</span> and space <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{1 +
\rho} \log k)\)</span> for a small <span class="math inline">\(\rho &lt;
1\)</span>. Our algorithm can be extended in several useful and
interesting ways increasing its practical appeal. Experiments with large
NY yellow taxi trip datasets show that our algorithm consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods thereby proving its
practical applicability.</p>
