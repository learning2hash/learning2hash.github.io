Carpooling, or sharing a ride with other passengers, holds immense potential for urban transportation. Ridesharing platforms enable such sharing of rides using real-time data. Finding ride matches in real-time at urban scale is a difficult combinatorial optimization task and mostly heuristic approaches are applied. In this work, we mathematically model the problem as that of finding near-neighbors and devise a novel efficient spatio-temporal search algorithm based on the theory of locality sensitive hashing for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). The proposed algorithm can find \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} near-optimal potential matches for every ride from a pool of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} rides in time $O(n^\{1 + \rho\} (k + \log n) \log k)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( and space \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}O(n^\{1 + \rho\} \log k)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( for a small \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\rho < 1$. Our algorithm can be extended in several useful and interesting ways increasing its practical appeal. Experiments with large NY yellow taxi trip datasets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods thereby proving its practical applicability.
