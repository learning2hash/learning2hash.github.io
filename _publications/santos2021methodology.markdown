Computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
presented promising results on image-based fruit detection at ground-level for
different crops. However, the integration of the detections found in different
images, allowing accurate fruit counting and yield prediction, have received
less attention. This work presents a methodology for automated fruit counting
employing aerial-images. It includes algorithms based on multiple view geometry
to perform fruits tracking, not just avoiding double counting but also locating
the fruits in the 3-D space. Preliminary assessments show correlations above
0.8 between fruit counting and true yield for apples. The annotated dataset
employed on CNN training is publicly available.
