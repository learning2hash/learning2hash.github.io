A family of sets \(A\) is said to be an antichain if \(x\not\subset y\) for all
distinct \(x,y\in A\), and it is said to be a distance-\(r\) code if every pair of
distinct elements of \(A\) has Hamming distance at least \(r\). Here, we prove that
if \(A\subset 2^\{[n]\}\) is both an antichain and a distance-\((2r+1)\) code, then
\(|A| = O_r(2^n n^\{-r-1/2\})\). This result, which is best-possible up to the
implied constant, is a purely combinatorial strengthening of a number of
results in Littlewood--Offord theory; for example, our result gives a short
combinatorial proof of H\'alasz's theorem, while all previously known proofs of
this result are Fourier-analytic.
