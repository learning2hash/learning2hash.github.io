Let \(S=\Gamma\backslash \mathbb\{H\}\) be a hyperbolic surface of finite
topological type, such that the Fuchsian group \(\Gamma \le
\operatorname\{PSL\}_2(\mathbb\{R\})\) is non-elementary, and consider any
generating set \(\mathfrak S\) of \(\Gamma\). When sampling by an \(n\)-step random
walk in \(\pi_1(S) \cong \Gamma\) with each step given by an element in
\(\mathfrak S\), the subset of this sampled set comprised of hyperbolic elements
approaches full measure as \(n\to \infty\), and for this subset, the distribution
of geometric lengths obeys a Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Large
Deviations Principle, and Local Limit Theorem. We give a proof of this known
theorem using Gromov's theorem on translation lengths of Gromov-hyperbolic
groups.
