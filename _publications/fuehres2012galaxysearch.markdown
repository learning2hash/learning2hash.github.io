We propose a dynamic map of knowledge generated from Wikipedia pages and the
Web URLs contained therein. GalaxySearch provides answers to the questions we
don't know how to ask, by constructing a semantic network of the most relevant
pages in Wikipedia related to a search term. This search graph is constructed
based on the Wikipedia bidirectional link structure, the most recent edits on
the pages, the importance of the page, and the article quality; search results
are then ranked by the centrality of their network position. GalaxySearch
provides the results in three related ways: (1) WikiSearch - identifying the
most prominent Wikipedia pages and Weblinks for a chosen topic, (2) WikiMap -
creating a visual temporal map of the changes in the semantic network generated
by the search results over the lifetime of the returned Wikipedia articles, and
(3) WikiPulse - finding the most recent and most relevant changes and updates
about a topic.
