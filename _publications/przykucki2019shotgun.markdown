Mossel and Ross raised the question of when a random colouring of a graph can
be reconstructed from local information, namely the colourings (with
multiplicity) of balls of given radius. In this paper, we are concerned with
random \\(2\\)-colourings of the vertices of the \\(n\\)-dimensional hypercube, or
equivalently random Boolean functions. In the worst case, balls of diameter
\\(Î©(n)\\) are required to reconstruct. However, the situation for random
colourings is dramatically different: we show that almost every \\(2\\)-colouring
can be reconstructed from the multiset of colourings of balls of radius \\(2\\).
Furthermore, we show that for \\(q \ge n^\{2+\epsilon\}\\), almost every
\\(q\\)-colouring can be reconstructed from the multiset of colourings of
\\(1\\)-balls.
