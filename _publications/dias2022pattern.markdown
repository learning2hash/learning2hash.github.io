This paper presents a deep learning approach for image retrieval and pattern spotting in digital collections of historical documents. First a region proposal algorithm detects object candidates in the document page images. Next deep learning models are used for feature extraction considering two distinct variants which provide either real45;valued or binary code representations. Finally candidate images are ranked by computing the feature similarity with a given input query. A robust experimental protocol evaluates the proposed approach considering each representation scheme (real45;valued and binary code) on the DocExplore image database. The experimental results show that the proposed deep models compare favorably to the state45;of45;the45;art image retrieval approaches for images of historical documents outperforming other deep models by 2.56 percentage points using the same techniques for pattern spotting. Besides the proposed approach also reduces the search time by up to 200x and the storage cost up to 6000x when compared to related works based on real45;valued representations.
