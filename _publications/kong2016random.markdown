Let \\(K\\) be a self-similar set satisfying the open set condition. Following
Kaimanovich's elegant idea, it has been proved that on the symbolic space \\(X\\)
of \\(K\\) a natural augmented tree structure \\(\{\mathfrak E\}\\) exists; it is
hyperbolic, and the hyperbolic boundary \\(\partial_HX\\) with the Gromov metric is
H\"older equivalent to \\(K\\). In this paper we consider certain reversible random
walks with return ratio \\(0< \lambda <1\\) on \\((X, \{\mathfrak E\})\\). We show that
the Martin boundary \\(\{\mathcal M\}\\) can be identified with \\(\partial_H X\\) and
\\(K\\). With this setup and a device of Silverstein, we obtain precise estimates
of the Martin kernel and the Na\"\{i\}m kernel in terms of the Gromov product.
Moreover, the Na\"\{i\}m kernel turns out to be a jump kernel satisfying the
estimate \\(\Theta (\xi, \eta) \asymp |\xi-\eta|^\{-(\alpha+ \beta)\}\\), where
\\(\alpha\\) is the Hausdorff dimension of \\(K\\) and \\(\beta\\) depends on \\(\lambda\\).
For suitable \\(\beta\\), the kernel defines a regular non-local Dirichlet form on
\\(K\\). This extends the results of Kigami concerning random walks on certain
trees with Cantor-type sets as boundaries.
