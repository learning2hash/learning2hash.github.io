We propose a way of characterizing the algorithms computing a Walsh-Hadamard transform that consist of a sequence of arrays of butterflies (\(I\_\&amp;\#123;2^\&amp;\#123;n-1\&amp;\#125;\&amp;\#125;\otimes \text\&amp;\#123;DFT\&amp;\#125;\_2\)) interleaved by linear permutations. Linear permutations are those that map linearly the binary representation of its element indices. We also propose a method to enumerate these algorithms.
