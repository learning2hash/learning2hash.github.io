We propose a way of characterizing the algorithms computing a Walsh-Hadamard transform that consist of a sequence of arrays of butterflies ($I\_\{2^\{n-1\}\}\otimes \text\{DFT\}\_2$) interleaved by linear permutations. Linear permutations are those that map linearly the binary representation of its element indices. We also propose a method to enumerate these algorithms.
