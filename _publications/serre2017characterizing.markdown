We propose a way of characterizing the algorithms computing a Walsh-Hadamard
transform that consist of a sequence of arrays of butterflies
(\(I_\{2^\{n-1\}\}\otimes \text\{DFT\}_2\)) interleaved by linear permutations. Linear
permutations are those that map linearly the binary representation of its
element indices. We also propose a method to enumerate these algorithms.
