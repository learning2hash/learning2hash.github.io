This document covers a library for fast similarity (k-NN)search. It describes
only search methods and distances (spaces). Details about building, installing,
Python bindings can be found
online:https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib/tree/v1.8/. Even though the
library contains a variety of exact metric-space access methods, our main focus
is on more generic and approximate search methods, in particular, on methods
for non-metric spaces. NMSLIB is possibly the first library with a principled
support for non-metric space searching.
