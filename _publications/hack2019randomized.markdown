As a natural analog of Urysohn's inequality in Euclidean space, Gao, Hug, and
Schneider showed in 2003 that in spherical or hyperbolic space, the total
measure of totally geodesic hypersurfaces meeting a given convex body K is
minimized when K is a geodesic ball. We present a random extension of this
result by taking K to be the convex hull of finitely many points drawn
according to a probability distribution and by showing that the minimum is
attained for uniform distributions on geodesic balls. As a corollary, we obtain
a randomized Blaschke--Santalo inequality on the sphere.
