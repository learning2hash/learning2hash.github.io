We introduce a dataset of seagrass images collected by a biologist
snorkelling in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, as described in our
publication: arXiv:2009.09924. The images are labelled at the image-level by
collecting images of the same morphotype in a folder hierarchy. We also release
pre-trained models and training codes for detection and classification of
seagrass species at the patch level at
