Classifying logo images is a challenging task as they contain elements such
as text or shapes that can represent anything from known objects to abstract
shapes. While the current state of the art for logo classification addresses
the problem as a multi-class task focusing on a single characteristic, logos
can have several simultaneous labels, such as different colors. This work
proposes a method that allows visually similar logos to be classified and
searched from a set of data according to their shape, color, commercial sector,
semantics, general characteristics, or a combination of features selected by
the user. Unlike previous approaches, the proposal employs a series of
multi-label deep neural networks specialized in specific attributes and
combines the obtained features to perform the similarity search. To delve into
the classification system, different existing logo topologies are compared and
some of their problems are analyzed, such as the incomplete labeling that
trademark registration databases usually contain. The proposal is evaluated
considering 76,000 logos (7 times more than previous approaches) from the
European Union Trademarks dataset, which is organized hierarchically using the
Vienna ontology. Overall, experimentation attains reliable quantitative and
qualitative results, reducing the normalized average rank error of the
state-of-the-art from 0.040 to 0.018 for the Trademark Image Retrieval task.
Finally, given that the semantics of logos can often be subjective, graphic
design students and professionals were surveyed. Results show that the proposed
methodology provides better labeling than a human expert operator, improving
the label ranking average precision from 0.53 to 0.68.
