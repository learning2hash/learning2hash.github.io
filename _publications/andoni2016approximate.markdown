<p>We show that every symmetric normed space admits an efficient nearest
neighbor search data structure with doubly-logarithmic approximation.
Specifically, for every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(d = n^{o(1)}\)</span>, and every <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional symmetric norm <span
class="math inline">\(\|\cdot\|\)</span>, there exists a data structure
for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{poly}(\log \log
n)\)</span>-approximate nearest neighbor search over <span
class="math inline">\(\|\cdot\|\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-point datasets achieving <span
class="math inline">\(n^{o(1)}\)</span> query time and <span
class="math inline">\(n^{1+o(1)}\)</span> space. The main technical
ingredient of the algorithm is a low-distortion embedding of a symmetric
norm into a low-dimensional iterated product of top-<span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> norms. We also show that our techniques
cannot be extended to general norms.</p>
