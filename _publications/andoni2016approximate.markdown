We show that every symmetric normed space admits an efficient nearest neighbor search data structure with doubly-logarithmic approximation. Specifically, for every \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d = n^\{o(1)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and every \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-dimensional symmetric norm \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\|\cdot\|\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, there exists a data structure for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathrm\{poly\}(\log \log n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-approximate nearest neighbor search over \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\|\cdot\|\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-point datasets achieving \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n^\{o(1)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} query time and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n^\{1+o(1)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} space. The main technical ingredient of the algorithm is a low-distortion embedding of a symmetric norm into a low-dimensional iterated product of top-\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} norms. We also show that our techniques cannot be extended to general norms.
