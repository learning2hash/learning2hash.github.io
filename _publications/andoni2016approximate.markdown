We show that every symmetric normed space admits an efficient nearest neighbor search data structure with doubly-logarithmic approximation. Specifically, for every \(n\), \(d = n^{o(1)}\), and every \(d\)-dimensional symmetric norm \(\|\cdot\|\), there exists a data structure for \(\\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)\)-approximate nearest neighbor search over \(\|\cdot\|\) for \(n\)-point datasets achieving \(n^{o(1)}\) query time and \(n^{1+o(1)}\) space. The main technical ingredient of the algorithm is a low-distortion embedding of a symmetric norm into a low-dimensional iterated product of top-\(k\) norms. We also show that our techniques cannot be extended to general norms.
