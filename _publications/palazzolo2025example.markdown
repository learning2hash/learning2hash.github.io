We propose a new method for synthesizing an arbitrarily sized novel vector
texture given a single raster exemplar. Our method first segments the exemplar
to extract the primary textons, and then clusters them based on visual
similarity. We then compute a descriptor to capture each texton's neighborhood
which contains the inter-category relationships that are used at synthesis
time. Next, we use a simple procedure to both extract and place the secondary
textons behind the primary polygons. Finally, our method constructs a gradient
field for the background which is defined by a set of data points and colors.
The color of the secondary polygons are also adjusted to better match the
gradient field. To compare our work with other methods, we use a wide range of
perceptual-based metrics.
