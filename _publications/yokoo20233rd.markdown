This paper presents our 3rd place solution in both Descriptor Track and
Matching Track of the Meta AI Video Similarity Challenge (VSC2022), a
competition aimed at detecting video copies. Our approach builds upon existing
image copy detection techniques and incorporates several strategies to exploit
on the properties of video data, resulting in a simple yet powerful solution.
By employing our proposed method, we achieved substantial improvements in
accuracy compared to the baseline results (Descriptor Track: 38% improvement,
Matching Track: 60% improvement). Our code is publicly available here:
