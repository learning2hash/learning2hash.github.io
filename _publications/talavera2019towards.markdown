Nowadays, there is an upsurge of interest in using lifelogging devices. Such
devices generate huge amounts of image data; consequently, the need for
automatic methods for analyzing and summarizing these data is drastically
increasing. We present a new method for familiar scene recognition in
egocentric videos, based on background pattern detection through automatically
configurable COSFIRE filters. We present some experiments over egocentric data
acquired with the Narrative Clip.
