What food is so good as to be considered pornographic? Worldwide, the popular
\#foodporn hashtag has been used to share appetizing pictures of peoples'
favorite culinary experiences. But social scientists ask whether \#foodporn
promotes an unhealthy relationship with food, as pornography would contribute
to an unrealistic view of sexuality. In this study, we examine nearly 10
million Instagram posts by 1.7 million users worldwide. An overwhelming (and
uniform across the nations) obsession with chocolate and cake shows the
domination of sugary dessert over local cuisines. Yet, we find encouraging
traits in the association of emotion and health-related topics with \#foodporn,
suggesting food can serve as motivation for a healthy lifestyle. Social
approval also favors the healthy posts, with users posting with healthy
hashtags having an average of 1,000 more followers than those with unhealthy
ones. Finally, we perform a demographic analysis which shows nation-wide trends
of behavior, such as a strong relationship (r=0.51) between the GDP per capita
and the attention to healthiness of their favorite food. Our results expose a
new facet of food "pornography", revealing potential avenues for utilizing this
precarious notion for promoting healthy lifestyles.
