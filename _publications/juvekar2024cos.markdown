This study proposes a novel hybrid retrieval strategy for Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures
to improve retrieval performance, particularly for sparse data. The traditional
cosine similarity measure is widely used to capture the similarity between
vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However, it has been shown that this
measure can yield arbitrary results in certain scenarios. To address this
limitation, we incorporate cosine distance measures to provide a complementary
perspective by quantifying the dissimilarity between vectors. Our approach is
experimented on proprietary data, unlike recent publications that have used
open-source datasets. The proposed method demonstrates enhanced retrieval
performance and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic
relationships between documents or items. This hybrid strategy offers a
promising solution for efficiently and accurately retrieving relevant
information in knowledge-intensive applications, leveraging techniques such as
BM25 (sparse) retrieval , vector (Dense) retrieval, and cosine distance based
retrieval to facilitate efficient information retrieval.
