Several measures exist for string similarity, including notable ones like the
edit distance and the indel distance. The former measures the count of
insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into
another, while the latter specifically quantifies the number of insertions and
deletions. Many algorithmic solutions explicitly address one of these measures,
and frequently techniques applicable to one can also be adapted to work with
the other. In this paper, we investigate whether there exists a standardized
approach for applying results from one setting to another. Specifically, we
demonstrate the capability to reduce questions regarding string similarity over
arbitrary alphabets to equivalent questions over a binary alphabet.
Furthermore, we illustrate how to transform questions concerning indel distance
into equivalent questions based on edit distance. This complements an earlier
result of Tiskin (2007) which addresses the inverse direction.
