We present a new approach to extraction of hypernyms based on projection
learning and word embeddings. In contrast to classification-based approaches,
projection-based methods require no candidate hyponym-hypernym pairs. While it
is natural to use both positive and negative training examples in supervised
relation extraction, the impact of negative examples on hypernym prediction was
not studied so far. In this paper, we show that explicit negative examples used
for regularization of the model significantly improve performance compared to
the state-of-the-art approach of Fu et al. (2014) on three datasets from
different languages.
