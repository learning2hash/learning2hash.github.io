In this work we demonstrate that multilingual large-scale sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models pre-trained on a mixture of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks are more efficient few-shot learners than decoder-only models on various tasks. In particular we train a 20 billion parameter multilingual seq2seq model called Alexa Teacher Model (AlexaTM 20B) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 1-shot summarization tasks outperforming a much larger 540B PaLM decoder model. AlexaTM 20B also achieves SOTA in 1-shot machine translation especially for low-resource languages across almost all language pairs supported by the model (Arabic English French German Hindi Italian Japanese Marathi Portuguese Spanish Tamil and Telugu) on Flores-101 dataset. We also show in zero-shot setting AlexaTM 20B outperforms GPT3 (175B) on SuperGLUE and SQuADv2 datasets and provides SOTA performance on multilingual tasks such as XNLI XCOPA Paws-X and XWinograd. Overall our results present a compelling case for seq2seq models as a powerful alternative to decoder-only models for Large-scale Language Model (LLM) training.
