We present an analysis of three possible strategies for exploiting the power
of existing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) in different scenarios
from the ones they were trained: full training, fine tuning, and using ConvNets
as feature extractors. In many applications, especially including remote
sensing, it is not feasible to fully design and train a new ConvNet, as this
usually requires a considerable amount of labeled data and demands high
computational costs. Therefore, it is important to understand how to obtain the
best profit from existing ConvNets. We perform experiments with six popular
ConvNets using three remote sensing datasets. We also compare ConvNets in each
strategy with existing descriptors and with state-of-the-art baselines. Results
point that fine tuning tends to be the best performing strategy. In fact, using
the features from the fine-tuned ConvNet with linear SVM obtains the best
results. We also achieved state-of-the-art results for the three datasets used.
