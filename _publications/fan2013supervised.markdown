This paper proposes to learn binary hash codes within
a statistical learning framework, in which an upper bound
of the probability of Bayes decision errors is derived for
different forms of hash functions and a rigorous proof of
the convergence of the upper bound is presented. Consequently, minimizing such an upper bound leads to consistent
performance improvements of existing hash code learning
algorithms, regardless of whether original algorithms are
unsupervised or supervised. This paper also illustrates a
fast hash coding method that exploits simple binary tests to
achieve orders of magnitude improvement in coding speed
as compared to projection based methods.
