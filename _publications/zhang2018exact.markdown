In this paper, we study the Favard length of some random Cantor sets of
Hausdorff dimension 1. We start with a unit disk in the plane and replace the
unit disk by \(4\) disjoint subdisks (with equal distance to each other) of
radius \(1/4\) inside and tangent to the unit disk. By repeating this operation
in a self-similar manner and adding a random rotation in each step, we can
generate a random Cantor set \(\{\cal D\}(\omega)\). Let \(\{\cal D\}_n\) be the \(n\)-th
generation in the construction, which is comparable to the
\(4^\{-n\}\)-neighborhood of \(\{\cal D\}\). We are interested in the decay rate of the
Favard length of these sets \(\{\cal D\}_n\) as \(n\to\infty\), which is the
likelihood (up to a constant) that "Buffon's needle" dropped randomly will fall
into the \(4^\{-n\}\)-neighborhood of \(\{\cal D\}\). It is well known in [P. Mattila,
Orthogonal projections, Riesz capacities, and Minkowski content, Indiana Univ.
Math. J. 39 (1990), no. 1, 185-198] that the lower bound of the Favard length
of \(\{\cal D\}_n(\omega)\) is constant multiple of \(n^\{-1\}\). We show that the
upper bound of the Favard length of \(\{\cal D\}_n(\omega)\) is \(C n^\{-1\}\) for some
\(C>0\) in the average sense. We also prove the similar linear decay for the
Favard length of \(\{\cal D\}^d_n(\omega)\) which is the \(d^\{-n\}\)-neighborhood of a
self-similar random Cantor set with degree \(d\) greater than \(4\). Notice in the
non-random case where the self-similar set has degree greater than \(4\), the
best known result for the decay rate of the Favard length is \(e^\{-c\sqrt \{log
n\}\}\).
