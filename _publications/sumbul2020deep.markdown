This chapter presents recent advances in content based image search and retrieval (CBIR) systems in remote sensing (RS) for fast and accurate information discovery from massive data archives. Initially, we analyze the limitations of the traditional CBIR systems that rely on the hand-crafted RS image descriptors. Then, we focus our attention on the advances in RS CBIR systems for which deep learning (DL) models are at the forefront. In particular, we present the theoretical properties of the most recent DL based CBIR systems for the characterization of the complex semantic content of RS images. After discussing their strengths and limitations, we present the deep hashing based CBIR systems that have high time-efficient search capability within huge data archives. Finally, the most promising research directions in RS CBIR are discussed.
