In this paper, we give upper bounds on the sizes of \\((d, L)\\) list-decodable
codes in the Hamming metric space from covering codes with the covering radius
smaller than or equal to \\(d\\). When the list size \\(L\\) is \\(1\\), this gives many
new Singleton type upper bounds on the sizes of codes with a given minimum
Hamming distance. These upper bounds are stronger than the Griesmer bound when
the lengths of codes are large. Some upper bounds on the lengths of general
small Singleton defect codes or list-decodable codes attaining the generalized
Singleton bound are given. As an application of our generalized Singleton type
upper bounds on Hamming metric error-correcting codes, the generalized
Singleton type upper bounds on insertion-deletion codes are given, which are
much stronger than the direct Singleton bound for insertion-deletion codes when
the lengths are large. We also give upper bounds on the lengths of small
dimension optimal locally recoverable codes and small dimension optimal \\((r,
\delta)\\) locally recoverable codes with any fixed given minimum distance.
