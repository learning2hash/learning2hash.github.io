We consider the coding problem in the Stiefel manifold with chordal distance.
After considering various low-dimensional instances of this problem, we use
Rankin's bounds on spherical codes to prove upper bounds on the minimum
distance of a Stiefel code, and then we construct several examples of codes
that achieve equality in these bounds.
