While textual reviews have become prominent in many recommendation-based
systems, automated frameworks to provide relevant visual cues against text
reviews where pictures are not available is a new form of task confronted by
data mining and machine learning researchers. Suggestions of pictures that are
relevant to the content of a review could significantly benefit the users by
increasing the effectiveness of a review. We propose a deep learning-based
framework to automatically: (1) tag the images available in a review dataset,
(2) generate a caption for each image that does not have one, and (3) enhance
each review by recommending relevant images that might not be uploaded by the
corresponding reviewer. We evaluate the proposed framework using the Yelp
Challenge Dataset. While a subset of the images in this particular dataset are
correctly captioned, the majority of the pictures do not have any associated
text. Moreover, there is no mapping between reviews and images. Each image has
a corresponding business-tag where the picture was taken, though. The overall
data setting and unavailability of crucial pieces required for a mapping make
the problem of recommending images for reviews a major challenge. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluations indicate that our proposed framework provides high
quality enhancements through automatic captioning, tagging, and recommendation
for mapping reviews and images.
