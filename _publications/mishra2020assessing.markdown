Named Entity Recognition (NER) is often the first step towards automated
Knowledge Base (KB) generation from raw text. In this work, we assess the bias
in various Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems for English across different
demographic groups with synthetically generated corpora. Our analysis reveals
that models perform better at identifying names from specific demographic
groups across two datasets. We also identify that debiased embeddings do not
help in resolving this issue. Finally, we observe that character-based
contextualized word representation models such as ELMo results in the least
bias across demographics. Our work can shed light on potential biases in
automated KB generation due to systematic exclusion of named entities belonging
to certain demographics.
