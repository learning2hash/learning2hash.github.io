In this paper, we introduce and investigate the neighborhood of binary
self-dual codes. We prove that there is no better Type I code than the best
Type II code of the same length. Further, we give some new necessary conditions
for the existence of a singly-even \\((56,28,12)\\)-code and a doubly-even
\\((72,36,16)\\)-code.
