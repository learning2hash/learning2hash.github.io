We study geodesics in the Brownian map \((\mathcal\{S\},d,\nu)\), the random
metric measure space which arises as the Gromov-Hausdorff scaling limit of
uniformly random planar maps. Our results apply to all geodesics including
those between exceptional points.
  First, we prove a strong and quantitative form of the confluence of geodesics
phenomenon which states that any pair of geodesics which are sufficiently close
in the Hausdorff distance must coincide with each other except near their
endpoints.
  Then, we show that the intersection of any two geodesics minus their
endpoints is connected, the number of geodesics which emanate from a single
point and are disjoint except at their starting point is at most \(5\), and the
maximal number of geodesics which connect any pair of points is \(9\). For each
\(1\le k \le 9\), we obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the pairs of points
connected by exactly \(k\) geodesics. For \(k=7,8,9\), such pairs have dimension
zero and are countably infinite. Further, we classify the (finite number of)
possible configurations of geodesics between any pair of points in
\(\mathcal\{S\}\), up to homeomorphism, and give a dimension upper bound for the
set of endpoints in each case.
  Finally, we show that every geodesic can be approximated arbitrarily well and
in a strong sense by a geodesic connecting \(\nu\)-typical points. In particular,
this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Angel, Kolesnik, and
Miermont that the geodesic frame of \(\mathcal\{S\}\), the union of all of the
geodesics in \(\mathcal\{S\}\) minus their endpoints, has dimension one, the
dimension of a single geodesic.
