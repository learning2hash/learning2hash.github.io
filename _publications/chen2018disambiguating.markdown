Everyday place descriptions often contain place names of fine-grained
features, such as buildings or businesses, that are more difficult to
disambiguate than names referring to larger places, for example cities or
natural geographic features. Fine-grained places are often significantly more
frequent and more similar to each other, and disambiguation heuristics
developed for larger places, such as those based on population or containment
relationships, are often not applicable in these cases. In this research, we
address the disambiguation of fine-grained place names from everyday place
descriptions. For this purpose, we evaluate the performance of different
existing clustering-based approaches, since clustering approaches require no
more knowledge other than the locations of ambiguous place names. We consider
not only approaches developed specifically for place name disambiguation, but
also clustering algorithms developed for general data mining that could
potentially be leveraged. We compare these methods with a novel algorithm, and
show that the novel algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of
disambiguation precision and distance error over several tested datasets.
