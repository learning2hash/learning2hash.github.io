We give a solution to the isoperimetric problem for the exponential measure
on the plane with the \(\ell_1\)-metric. As it turns out, among all sets of a
given measure, the simplex or its complement (i.e. the ball in the
\(\ell_1\)-metric or its complement) has the smallest boundary measure. The proof
is based on a symmetrisation (along the sections of equal \(\ell_1\)-distance
from the origin).
