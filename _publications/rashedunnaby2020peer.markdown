<p>Verifying identity documents from a large Central Identity Database
(CIDB) is always challenging and it get more challenging when we need to
verify a large number of documents at the same time. Usually most of the
time we setup a gateway server connected to the CIDB and it serve all
the identity document verification requests. Though it work well, there
are still chances that this model will collapse in high traffic. We
obviously can tune the system to be sustainable, but the process is
economically expensive. In this paper we propose an economically cheaper
way to verify ID documents with private BitTorrent network and hash
function.</p>
