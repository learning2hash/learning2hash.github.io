Entropy-based detection methodologies have gained significant attention due
to their ability to analyze structural irregularities within executable files,
particularly in the identification of malicious software employing advanced
obfuscation techniques. The Entropy-Synchronized Neural Hashing (ESNH)
framework introduces a novel approach that leverages entropy-driven hash
representations to classify software binaries based on their underlying entropy
characteristics. Through the synchronization of entropy profiles with neural
network architectures, the model generates robust and unique hash values that
maintain stability even when faced with polymorphic and metamorphic
transformations. Comparative analysis against traditional detection approaches
revealed superior performance in identifying novel threats, reducing
false-positive rates, and achieving consistent classification across diverse
ransomware families. The incorporation of a self-regulating hash convergence
mechanism further ensured that entropy-synchronized hashes remained invariant
across executions, minimizing classification inconsistencies that often arise
due to dynamic modifications in ransomware payloads. Experimental results
demonstrated high detection rates across contemporary ransomware strains, with
the model exhibiting resilience against encryption-based evasion mechanisms,
code injection strategies, and reflective loading techniques. Unlike
conventional detection mechanisms that rely on static signatures and heuristic
analysis, the proposed entropy-aware classification framework adapts to
emerging threats through an inherent ability to capture entropy anomalies
within executable structures. The findings reinforce the potential of
entropy-based detection in addressing the limitations of traditional
methodologies while enhancing detection robustness against obfuscation and
adversarial evasion techniques.
