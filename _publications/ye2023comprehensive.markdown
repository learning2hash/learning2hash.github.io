GPT series models such as GPT-3 CodeX InstructGPT ChatGPT and so on have gained considerable attention due to their exceptional natural language processing capabilities. However despite the abundance of research on the difference in capabilities between GPT series models and fine-tuned models there has been limited attention given to the evolution of GPT series models capabilities over time. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of GPT series models we select six representative models comprising two GPT-3 series models (i.e. davinci and text-davinci-001) and four GPT-3.5 series models (i.e. code-davinci-002 text-davinci-002 text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo). We evaluate their performance on nine natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using 21 datasets. In particular we compare the performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal that the overall ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the models evolve especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy. While this strategy enhances the models ability to generate human-like responses it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. Furthermore our findings indicate that there is still room for improvement in areas such as model robustness.
