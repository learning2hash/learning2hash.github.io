We introduce the Multi30K dataset to stimulate multilingual multimodal
research. Recent advances in image description have been demonstrated on
English-language datasets almost exclusively, but image description should not
be limited to English. This dataset extends the Flickr30K dataset with i)
German translations created by professional translators over a subset of the
English descriptions, and ii) descriptions crowdsourced independently of the
original English descriptions. We outline how the data can be used for
multilingual image description and multimodal machine translation, but we
anticipate the data will be useful for a broader range of tasks.
