Given a sub-Riemannian manifold, a relevant question is: what are the metric
lines (isometric embedding of the real line)? The space of \(k\)-jets of a real
function of one real variable \(x\), denoted by \(J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\})\),
admits the structure of a Carnot group, as every Carnot group
\(J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\})\) is a sub-Riemannian Manifold. This work is devoted
to provide a partial result about the classification of the metric lines in
\(J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\})\). The method to prove the main Theorems is to use
an intermediate \(3\)-dimensional sub-Riemannian space \(\mathbb\{R\}^\{3\}_F\) lying
between the group \(J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\})\) and the Euclidean space
\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{2\} \simeq J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\}) /
[J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\}),J^k(\mathbb\{R\},\mathbb\{R\})]\).
