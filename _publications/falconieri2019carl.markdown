Security analysts need to classify, search and correlate numerous images.
Automatic classification tools improve the efficiency of such tasks. Many
Image-Matching algorithms are presented in the litterature. The present paper
introduces and provides a Open-Source benchmarking and evaluation tool for
these algorithms. Is this paper, the framework evaluates algorithms on
illustrative datasets, which are constituted of phishing and onion websites.
Datasets are provided as Open-Data.
