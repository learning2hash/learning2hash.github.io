Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research.
