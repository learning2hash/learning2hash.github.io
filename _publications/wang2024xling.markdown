Similarity join finds all pairs of close points within a given distance
threshold. Many similarity join methods have been proposed, but they are
usually not efficient on high-dimensional space due to the curse of
dimensionality and data-unawareness. We investigate the possibility of using
metric space Bloom filter (MSBF), a family of data structures checking if a
query point has neighbors in a multi-dimensional space, to speed up similarity
join. However, there are several challenges when applying MSBF to similarity
join, including excessive information loss, data-unawareness and hard
constraint on the distance metric. In this paper, we propose Xling, a generic
framework to build a learning-based metric space filter with any existing
regression model, aiming at accurately predicting whether a query point has
enough number of neighbors. The framework provides a suite of optimization
strategies to further improve the prediction quality based on the learning
model, which has demonstrated significantly higher prediction quality than
existing MSBF. We also propose XJoin, one of the first filter-based similarity
join methods, based on Xling. By predicting and skipping those queries without
enough neighbors, XJoin can effectively reduce unnecessary neighbor searching
and therefore it achieves a remarkable acceleration. Benefiting from the
generalization capability of deep learning models, XJoin can be easily
transferred onto new dataset (in similar distribution) without re-training.
Furthermore, Xling is not limited to being applied in XJoin, instead, it acts
as a flexible plugin that can be inserted to any loop-based similarity join
methods for a speedup.
