Recent advancement of research in biometrics, computer vision, and natural
language processing has discovered opportunities for person retrieval from
surveillance videos using textual query. The prime objective of a surveillance
system is to locate a person using a description, e.g., a short woman with a
pink t-shirt and white skirt carrying a black purse. She has brown hair. Such a
description contains attributes like gender, height, type of clothing, colour
of clothing, hair colour, and accessories. Such attributes are formally known
as soft biometrics. They help bridge the semantic gap between a human
description and a machine as a textual query contains the person's soft
biometric attributes. It is also not feasible to manually search through huge
volumes of surveillance footage to retrieve a specific person. Hence, automatic
person retrieval using vision and language-based algorithms is becoming
popular. In comparison to other state-of-the-art reviews, the contribution of
the paper is as follows: 1. Recommends most discriminative soft biometrics for
specifiic challenging conditions. 2. Integrates benchmark datasets and
retrieval methods for objective performance evaluation. 3. A complete snapshot
of techniques based on features, classifiers, number of soft biometric
attributes, type of the deep neural networks, and performance measures. 4. The
comprehensive coverage of person retrieval from handcrafted features based
methods to end-to-end approaches based on natural language description.
