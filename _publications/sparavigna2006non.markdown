The paper describes a new image processing for a non-photorealistic
rendering. The algorithm is based on a random generation of gray tones and
competing statistical requirements. The gray tone value of each pixel in the
starting image is replaced selecting among randomly generated tone values,
according to the statistics of nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
pixels. Two competing conditions for replacing the tone values - one position
on the local mean value the other on the local variance - produce a peculiar
pattern on the image. This pattern has a labyrinthine tiling aspect. For
certain subjects, the pattern enhances the look of the image.
