Natural language place descriptions in everyday communication provide a rich
source of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such
knowledge in information systems is geo-referencing all the places referred to
in these descriptions. Current techniques for geo-referencing places from text
documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place
descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers,
or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for
geo-referencing presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains
the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place
descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of
places and allow the later best-matching process for geo-referencing. The novel
geo-referencing process results in higher precision and recall compared to
state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description
datasets.
