Symbolic music research plays a crucial role in music-related machine
learning, but MIDI data can be complex for those without musical expertise. To
address this issue, we present MidiTok Visualizer, a web application designed
to facilitate the exploration and visualization of various MIDI tokenization
methods from the MidiTok Python package. MidiTok Visualizer offers numerous
customizable parameters, enabling users to upload MIDI files to visualize
tokenized data alongside an interactive piano roll.
