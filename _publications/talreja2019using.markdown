<p>With benefits of fast query speed and low storage cost, hashing-based
image retrieval approaches have garnered considerable attention from the
research community. In this paper, we propose a novel Error-Corrected
Deep Cross Modal Hashing (CMH-ECC) method which uses a bitmap specifying
the presence of certain facial attributes as an input query to retrieve
relevant face images from the database. In this architecture, we
generate compact hash codes using an end-to-end deep learning module,
which effectively captures the inherent relationships between the face
and attribute modality. We also integrate our deep learning module with
forward error correction codes to further reduce the distance between
different modalities of the same subject. Specifically, the properties
of deep hashing and forward error correction codes are exploited to
design a cross modal hashing framework with high retrieval performance.
Experimental results using two standard datasets with facial
attributes-image modalities indicate that our CMH-ECC face image
retrieval model outperforms most of the current attribute-based face
image retrieval approaches.</p>
