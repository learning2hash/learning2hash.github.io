This work follows the approach of multi-label classification for
non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). We modify the popular sparse
representation based classification (SRC) approach (developed for single label
classification) to solve multi-label classification problems. Results on
benchmark REDD and Pecan Street dataset shows significant improvement over
state-of-the-art techniques with small volume of training data.
