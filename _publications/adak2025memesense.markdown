Memes present unique moderation challenges due to their subtle, multimodal
interplay of images, text, and social context. Standard systems relying
predominantly on explicit textual cues often overlook harmful content
camouflaged by irony, symbolism, or cultural references. To address this gap,
we introduce MemeSense, an adaptive in-context learning framework that fuses
social commonsense reasoning with visually and semantically related reference
examples. By encoding crucial task information into a learnable cognitive shift
vector, MemeSense effectively balances lexical, visual, and ethical
considerations, enabling precise yet context-aware meme intervention. Extensive
evaluations on a curated set of implicitly harmful memes demonstrate that
MemeSense substantially outperforms strong baselines, paving the way for safer
online communities. Code and data available at:
