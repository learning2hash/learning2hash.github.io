Deep hashing has shown promising results in image retrieval and recognition. Despite its success most existing deep hashing approaches are rather similar either multi45;layer perceptron or CNN is applied to extract image feature followed by different binarization activation functions such as sigmoid tanh or autoencoder to generate binary code. In this work we introduce a novel decision45;making approach for deep supervised hashing. We formulate the hashing problem as travelling across the vertices in the binary code space and learn a deep Q45;network with a novel label embedding reward defined by Bose45;Chaudhuri45;Hocquenghem (BCH) codes to explore the best path. Extensive experiments and analysis on the CIFAR45;10 and NUS45;WIDE dataset show that our approach outperforms state45;of45;the45;art supervised hashing methods under various code lengths.
