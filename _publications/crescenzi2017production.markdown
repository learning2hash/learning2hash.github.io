Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base from the Wikimedia Foundation,
that not only acts as a central storage of structured data for other projects
of the organization, but also for a growing array of information systems,
including search engines. Like Wikipedia, Wikidata's content can be created and
edited by anyone; which is the main source of its strength, but also allows for
malicious users to vandalize it, risking the spreading of misinformation
through all the systems that rely on it as a source of structured facts. Our
task at the WSDM Cup 2017 was to come up with a fast and reliable prediction
system that narrows down suspicious edits for human revision. Elaborating on
previous works by Heindorf et al. we were able to outperform all other
contestants, while incorporating new interesting features, unifying the
programming language used to only Python and refactoring the feature extractor
into a simpler and more compact code base.
