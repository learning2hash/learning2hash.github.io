In contrast to the well-established technique of rasterization, vectorization
of images poses a significant challenge in the field of computer graphics.
Recent learning-based methods for converting raster images to vector formats
frequently suffer from incomplete shapes, redundant path prediction, and a lack
of accuracy in preserving the semantics of the original content. These
shortcomings severely hinder the utility of these methods for further editing
and manipulation of images. To address these challenges, we present DeepIcon, a
novel hierarchical image vectorization network specifically tailored for
generating variable-length icon vector graphics based on the raster image
input. Our experimental results indicate that DeepIcon can efficiently produce
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) directly from raster images, bypassing the need
for a differentiable rasterizer while also demonstrating a profound
understanding of the image contents.
