A word embedding is a low-dimensional, dense and real- valued vector
representation of a word. Word embeddings have been used in many NLP tasks.
They are usually gener- ated from a large text corpus. The embedding of a word
cap- tures both its syntactic and semantic aspects. Tweets are short, noisy and
have unique lexical and semantic features that are different from other types
of text. Therefore, it is necessary to have word embeddings learned
specifically from tweets. In this paper, we present ten word embedding data
sets. In addition to the data sets learned from just tweet data, we also built
embedding sets from the general data and the combination of tweets with the
general data. The general data consist of news articles, Wikipedia data and
other web data. These ten embedding models were learned from about 400 million
tweets and 7 billion words from the general text. In this paper, we also
present two experiments demonstrating how to use the data sets in some NLP
tasks, such as tweet sentiment analysis and tweet topic classification tasks.
