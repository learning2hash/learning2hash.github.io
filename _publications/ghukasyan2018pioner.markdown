In this work, we tackle the problem of Armenian named entity recognition,
providing silver- and gold-standard datasets as well as establishing baseline
results on popular models. We present a 163000-token named entity corpus
automatically generated and annotated from Wikipedia, and another 53400-token
corpus of news sentences with manual annotation of people, organization and
location named entities. The corpora were used to train and evaluate several
popular named entity recognition models. Alongside the datasets, we release
50-, 100-, 200-, 300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings trained on a collection
of Armenian texts from Wikipedia, news, blogs, and encyclopedia.
