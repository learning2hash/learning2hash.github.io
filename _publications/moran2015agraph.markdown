In this paper we propose a two-step iterative scheme, Graph Regularised Hashing (GRH), for incrementally adjusting the positioning of the hashing hypersurfaces to better conform to the supervisory signal: in the first step the binary bits are regularised using a data similarity graph so that similar data points receive similar bits. In the second step the regularised hashcodes form targets for a set of binary classifiers which shift the position of each hypersurface so as to separate opposite bits with maximum margin. GRH exhibits superior retrieval accuracy to competing hashing methods.
