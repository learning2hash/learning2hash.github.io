With increasing usage of fingerprints as an important biometric data, the
need to compress the large fingerprint databases has become essential. The most
recommended compression algorithm, even by standards, is JPEG2K. But at high
compression rates, this algorithm is ineffective. In this paper, a model is
proposed which is based on parallel lines with same orientations, arbitrary
widths and same gray level values located on rectangle with constant gray level
value as background. We refer to this algorithm as Parallel Stroked Multi Line
(PSML). By using Adaptive Geometrical Wavelet and employing PSML, a compression
algorithm is developed. This compression algorithm can preserve fingerprint
structure and minutiae. The exact algorithm of computing the PSML model take
exponential time. However, we have proposed an alternative approximation
algorithm, which reduces the time complexity to \(O(n^3)\). The proposed PSML
alg. has significant advantage over Wedgelets Transform in PSNR value and
visual quality in compressed images. The proposed method, despite the lower
PSNR values than JPEG2K algorithm in common range of compression rates, in all
compression rates have nearly equal or greater advantage over JPEG2K when used
by Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS). At high compression
rates, according to PSNR values, mean EER rate and visual quality, the encoded
images with JPEG2K can not be identified from each other after compression.
But, images encoded by the PSML alg. retained the sufficient information to
maintain fingerprint identification performances similar to the ones obtained
by raw images without compression. One the U.are.U 400 database, the mean EER
rate for uncompressed images is 4.54%, while at 267:1 compression ratio, this
value becomes 49.41% and 6.22% for JPEG2K and PSML, respectively. This result
shows a significant improvement over the standard JPEG2K algorithm.
