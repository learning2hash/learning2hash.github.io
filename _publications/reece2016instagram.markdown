Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools
to successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were
computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color
analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models
outperformed general practitioners' average diagnostic success rate for
depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts
made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Photos posted by
depressed individuals were more likely to be bluer, grayer, and darker. Human
ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of
depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features.
These findings suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental
illness.
