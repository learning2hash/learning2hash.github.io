The goal of unsupervised representation learning is to extract a new
representation of data, such that solving many different tasks becomes easier.
Existing methods typically focus on vectorized data and offer little support
for relational data, which additionally describe relationships among instances.
In this work we introduce an approach for relational unsupervised
representation learning. Viewing a relational dataset as a hypergraph, new
features are obtained by clustering vertices and hyperedges. To find a
representation suited for many relational learning tasks, a wide range of
similarities between relational objects is considered, e.g. feature and
structural similarities. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and
show that models learned on such latent representations perform better, have
lower complexity, and outperform the existing approaches on classification
tasks.
