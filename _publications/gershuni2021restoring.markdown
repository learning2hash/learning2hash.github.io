We demonstrate that it is feasible to diacritize Hebrew script without any
human-curated resources other than plain diacritized text. We present NAKDIMON,
a two-layer character level LSTM, that performs on par with much more
complicated curation-dependent systems, across a diverse array of modern Hebrew
sources.
