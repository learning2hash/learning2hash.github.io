Looking at the world from above, it is possible to estimate many properties
of a given location, including the type of land cover and the expected land
use. Historically, such tasks have relied on relatively coarse-grained
categories due to the difficulty of obtaining fine-grained annotations. In this
work, we propose an easily extensible approach that makes it possible to
estimate fine-grained properties from overhead imagery. In particular, we
propose a cross-modal distillation strategy to learn to predict the
distribution of fine-grained properties from overhead imagery, without
requiring any manual annotation of overhead imagery. We show that our learned
models can be used directly for applications in mapping and image localization.
