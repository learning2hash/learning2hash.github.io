A large amount of recent research has focused on tasks that combine language
and vision, resulting in a proliferation of datasets and methods. One such task
is action recognition, whose applications include image annotation, scene
under- standing and image retrieval. In this survey, we categorize the existing
ap- proaches based on how they conceptualize this problem and provide a
detailed review of existing datasets, highlighting their di- versity as well as
advantages and disad- vantages. We focus on recently devel- oped datasets which
link visual informa- tion with linguistic resources and provide a fine-grained
syntactic and semantic anal- ysis of actions in images.
