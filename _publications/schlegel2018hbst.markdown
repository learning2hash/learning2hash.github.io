Reliable and efficient Visual Place Recognition is a major building block of
modern SLAM systems. Leveraging on our prior work, in this paper we present a
Hamming Distance embedding Binary Search Tree (HBST) approach for binary
Descriptor Matching and Image Retrieval. HBST allows for descriptor Search and
Insertion in logarithmic time by exploiting particular properties of binary
Feature descriptors. We support the idea behind our search structure with a
thorough analysis on the exploited descriptor properties and their effects on
completeness and complexity of search and insertion. To validate our claims we
conducted comparative experiments for HBST and several state-of-the-art methods
on a broad range of publicly available datasets. HBST is available as a compact
open-source C++ header-only library.
