A number of authors have described randomized algorithms for solving the
epsilon-approximate nearest neighbor problem. In this note I point out that the
epsilon-approximate nearest neighbor property often fails to be a useful
approximation property, since epsilon-approximate solutions fail to satisfy the
necessary preconditions for using nearest neighbors for classification and
related tasks.
