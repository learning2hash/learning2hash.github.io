In forensic facial comparison, questioned-source images are usually captured
in uncontrolled environments, with non-uniform lighting, and from
non-cooperative subjects. The poor quality of such material usually compromises
their value as evidence in legal matters. On the other hand, in forensic
casework, multiple images of the person of interest are usually available. In
this paper, we propose to aggregate deep neural network embeddings from various
images of the same person to improve performance in facial verification. We
observe significant performance improvements, especially for very low-quality
images. Further improvements are obtained by aggregating embeddings of more
images and by applying quality-weighted aggregation. We demonstrate the
benefits of this approach in forensic evaluation settings with the development
and validation of score-based likelihood ratio systems and report improvements
in Cllr of up to 95% (from 0.249 to 0.012) for CCTV images and of up to 96%
(from 0.083 to 0.003) for social media images.
