Mining high-quality bitexts for low-resource languages is challenging. This
paper shows that sentence representation of language models fine-tuned with
multiple negatives ranking loss, a contrastive objective, helps retrieve clean
bitexts. Experiments show that parallel data mined from our approach
substantially outperform the previous state-of-the-art method on low resource
languages Khmer and Pashto.
