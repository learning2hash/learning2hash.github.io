We propose a novel framework for cross-lingual content flagging with limited
target-language data, which significantly outperforms prior work in terms of
predictive performance. The framework is based on a nearest-neighbour
architecture. It is a modern instantiation of the vanilla k-nearest neighbour
model, as we use Transformer representations in all its components. Our
framework can adapt to new source-language instances, without the need to be
retrained from scratch. Unlike prior work on neighbourhood-based approaches, we
encode the neighbourhood information based on query--neighbour interactions. We
propose two encoding schemes and we show their effectiveness using both
qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our evaluation results on eight
languages from two different datasets for abusive language detection show
sizable improvements of up to 9.5 F1 points absolute (for Italian) over strong
baselines. On average, we achieve 3.6 absolute F1 points of improvement for the
three languages in the Jigsaw Multilingual dataset and 2.14 points for the WUL
dataset.
