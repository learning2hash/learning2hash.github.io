Artificial intelligence is currently powering diverse real-world
applications. These applications have shown promising performance, but raise
complicated ethical issues, i.e. how to embed ethics to make AI applications
behave morally. One way toward moral AI systems is by imitating human prosocial
behavior and encouraging some form of good behavior in systems. However,
learning such normative ethics (especially from images) is challenging mainly
due to a lack of data and labeling complexity. Here, we propose a model that
predicts visual commonsense immorality in a zero-shot manner. We train our
model with an ETHICS dataset (a pair of text and morality annotation) via a
CLIP-based image-text joint embedding. In a testing phase, the immorality of an
unseen image is predicted. We evaluate our model with existing moral/immoral
image datasets and show fair prediction performance consistent with human
intuitions. Further, we create a visual commonsense immorality benchmark with
more general and extensive immoral visual contents. Codes and dataset are
available at
