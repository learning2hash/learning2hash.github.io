Advancements in digital technologies make it easy to modify the content of
digital images. Hence, ensuring digital images integrity and authenticity is
necessary to protect them against various attacks that manipulate them. We
present a Deep Learning (DL) based dual invisible watermarking technique for
performing source authentication, content authentication, and protecting
digital content copyright of images sent over the internet. Beyond securing
images, the proposed technique demonstrates robustness to content-preserving
image manipulations. It is also impossible to imitate or overwrite watermarks
because the cryptographic hash of the image and the dominant features of the
image in the form of perceptual hash are used as watermarks. We highlighted the
need for source authentication to safeguard image integrity and authenticity,
along with identifying similar content for copyright protection. After
exhaustive testing, we obtained a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), which implies there is a minute
change in the original image after embedding our watermarks. Our trained model
achieves high watermark extraction accuracy and to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first deep learning-based dual watermarking technique proposed in
the literature.
