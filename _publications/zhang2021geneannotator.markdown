In this manuscript, we introduce a semi-automatic scene graph annotation tool
for images, the GeneAnnotator. This software allows human annotators to
describe the existing relationships between participators in the visual scene
in the form of directed graphs, hence enabling the learning and reasoning on
visual relationships, e.g., image captioning, VQA and scene graph generation,
etc. The annotations for certain image datasets could either be merged in a
single VG150 data-format file to support most existing models for scene graph
learning or transformed into a separated annotation file for each single image
to build customized datasets. Moreover, GeneAnnotator provides a rule-based
relationship recommending algorithm to reduce the heavy annotation workload.
With GeneAnnotator, we propose Traffic Genome, a comprehensive scene graph
dataset with 1000 diverse traffic images, which in return validates the
effectiveness of the proposed software for scene graph annotation. The project
source code, with usage examples and sample data is available at
https://github.com/Milomilo0320/A-Semi-automatic-Annotation-Software-for-Scene-Graph,
