Many applications require comparing multimodal data with different structure and dimensionality that cannot be compared directly. Recently there has been increasing interest in methods for learning and efficiently representing such multimodal similarity. In this paper we present a simple algorithm for multimodal similarity45;preserving hashing trying to map multimodal data into the Hamming space while preserving the intra45; and inter45;modal similarities. We show that our method significantly outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art method in the field.
