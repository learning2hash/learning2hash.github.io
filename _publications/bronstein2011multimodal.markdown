Many applications require comparing multimodal data with different structure and dimensionality that cannot be compared directly. Recently, there has been increasing interest in methods for learning and efficiently representing such multimodal similarity. In this paper, we present a simple algorithm for multimodal similarity-preserving hashing, trying to map multimodal data into the Hamming space while preserving the intra- and inter-modal similarities. We show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the field.
