We prove that hashing \\(n\\) balls into \\(n\\) bins via a random matrix over \\(\mathbf\{F\}_2\\) yields expected maximum load \\(O(log n / log log n)\\). This matches the expected maximum load of a fully random function and resolves an open question posed by Alon, Dietzfelbinger, Miltersen, Petrank, and Tardos (STOC '97, JACM '99). More generally, we show that the maximum load exceeds \\(r\cdotlog n/loglog n\\) with probability at most \\(O(1/r^2)\\).
