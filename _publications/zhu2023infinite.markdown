Combinatorial designs are closely related to linear codes. In recent year,
there are a lot of \(t\)-designs constructed from certain linear codes. In this
paper, we aim to construct \(2\)-designs from binary three-weight codes. For any
binary three-weight code \(\mathcal\{C\}\) with length \(n\), let
\(A_\{n\}(\mathcal\{C\})\) be the number of codewords in \(\mathcal\{C\}\) with Hamming
weight \(n\), then we show that \(\mathcal\{C\}\) holds \(2\)-designs when
\(\mathcal\{C\}\) is projective and \(A_\{n\}(\mathcal\{C\})=1\). Furthermore, by
extending some certain binary projective two-weight codes and basing on the
defining set method, we construct two classes of binary projective three-weight
codes which are suitable for holding \(2\)-designs.
