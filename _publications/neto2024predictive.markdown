Graphs face challenges when dealing with massive datasets. They are essential
tools for modeling interconnected data and often become computationally
expensive. Graph embedding techniques, on the other hand, provide an efficient
approach. By projecting complex graphs into a lower-dimensional space, these
techniques simplify the analysis and processing of large-scale graphs. By
transforming graphs into vectors, it simplifies the analysis and processing of
large-scale datasets. Several approaches, such as GraphSAGE, Node2Vec, and
FastRP, offer efficient methods for generating graph embeddings. By storing
embeddings as node properties, it is possible to compare different embedding
techniques and evaluate their effectiveness for specific tasks. This
flexibilityallows for dynamic updates to embeddings and facilitates
experimentation with different approaches. By analyzing these embeddings, one
can extract valuable insights into the relationships between nodes and their
similarities within the embedding space
