Massive amount of multimedia data that contain times- tamps and geographical
information are being generated at an unprecedented scale in many emerging
applications such as photo sharing web site and social networks applications.
Due to their importance, a large body of work has focused on efficiently
computing various spatial image queries. In this paper,we study the spatial
temporal image query which considers three important constraints during the
search including time recency, spatial proximity and visual relevance. A novel
index structure, namely Hierarchical Information Quadtree(\hiq), to efficiently
insert/delete spatial temporal images with high arrive rates. Base on \hiq an
efficient algorithm is developed to support spatial temporal image query. We
show via extensive experimentation with real spatial databases clearly
demonstrate the efficiency of our methods.
