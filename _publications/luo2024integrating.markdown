Conventional recommendation methods have achieved notable advancements by harnessing collaborative or sequential information from user behavior. Recently large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence for their capabilities in understanding and reasoning over textual semantics and have found utility in various domains including recommendation. Conventional recommendation methods and LLMs each have their strengths and weaknesses. While conventional methods excel at mining collaborative information and modeling sequential behavior they struggle with data sparsity and the long-tail problem. LLMs on the other hand are proficient at utilizing rich textual contexts but face challenges in mining collaborative or sequential information. Despite their individual successes there is a significant gap in leveraging their combined potential to enhance recommendation performance. In this paper we introduce a general and model-agnostic framework known as textbfLarge textbflanguage model with textbfmutual augmentation and textbfadaptive aggregation for textbfRecommendation (textbfLlama4Rec). Llama4Rec synergistically combines conventional and LLM-based recommendation models. Llama4Rec proposes data augmentation and prompt augmentation strategies tailored to enhance the conventional model and LLM respectively. An adaptive aggregation module is adopted to combine the predictions of both kinds of models to refine the final recommendation results. Empirical studies on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of Llama4Rec demonstrating its consistent outperformance of baseline methods and significant improvements in recommendation performance.
