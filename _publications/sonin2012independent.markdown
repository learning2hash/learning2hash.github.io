We count the number and patterns of pairs and tuples of independent events in
a simple random experiment: first a fair coin is flipped and then a fair die is
tossed. The first number, equal to 888,888, suggest that there are some open
questions about the structure of independence even in a finite sample space. We
discuss briefly these questions and possible approaches to answer them.
