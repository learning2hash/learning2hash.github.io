In this article, we study special points of a simple random walk and a
Gaussian free field, such as (nearly) favorite points, late points and high
points. In section \(2\), we extend results of [19] and suggest open problems for
\(d=2\). In section \(3\), we give a survey on the geometric structures of (nearly)
favorite points and late points of a simple random walk and high points of a
Gaussian free field in two dimension.
