We consider the Anderson model at large disorder on \\(\mathbb\{Z\}^2\\) where the
potential has a symmetric Bernoulli distribution. We prove that Anderson
localization happens outside a small neighborhood of finitely many energies.
These finitely many energies are Dirichlet eigenvalues of the minus Laplacian
restricted on some finite subsets of \\(\mathbb\{Z\}^\{2\}\\).
