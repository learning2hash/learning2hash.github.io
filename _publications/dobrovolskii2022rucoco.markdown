We present a new corpus with coreference annotation, Russian Coreference
Corpus (RuCoCo). The goal of RuCoCo is to obtain a large number of annotated
texts while maintaining high inter-annotator agreement. RuCoCo contains news
texts in Russian, part of which were annotated from scratch, and for the rest
the machine-generated annotations were refined by human annotators. The size of
our corpus is one million words and around 150,000 mentions. We make the corpus
publicly available.
