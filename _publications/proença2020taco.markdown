TACO is an open image dataset for litter detection and segmentation, which is
growing through crowdsourcing. Firstly, this paper describes this dataset and
the tools developed to support it. Secondly, we report instance segmentation
performance using Mask R-CNN on the current version of TACO. Despite its small
size (1500 images and 4784 annotations), our results are promising on this
challenging problem. However, to achieve satisfactory trash detection in the
wild for deployment, TACO still needs much more manual annotations. These can
be contributed using: http://tacodataset.org/
