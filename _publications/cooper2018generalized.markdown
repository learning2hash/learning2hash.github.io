Motivated by notions from coding theory, we study the generalized minimum
distance (GMD) function \\(\delta_I(d,r)\\) of a graded ideal \\(I\\) in a polynomial
ring over an arbitrary field using commutative algebraic methods. It is shown
that \\(\delta_I\\) is non-decreasing as a function of \\(r\\) and non-increasing as a
function of \\(d\\). For vanishing ideals over finite fields, we show that
\\(\delta_I\\) is strictly decreasing as a function of \\(d\\) until it stabilizes. We
also study algebraic invariants of Geramita ideals. Those ideals are graded,
unmixed, \\(1\\)-dimensional and their associated primes are generated by linear
forms. We also examine GMD functions of complete intersections and show some
special cases of two conjectures of Toh\u\{a\}neanu--Van Tuyl and
Eisenbud-Green-Harris.
