In this paper, we proposed a new efficient sorting algorithm based on
insertion sort concept. The proposed algorithm called Bidirectional Conditional
Insertion Sort (BCIS). It is in-place sorting algorithm and it has remarkably
efficient average case time complexity when compared with classical insertion
sort (IS). By comparing our new proposed algorithm with the Quicksort
algorithm, BCIS indicated faster average case time for relatively small size
arrays up to 1500 elements. Furthermore, BCIS was observed to be faster than
Quicksort within high rate of duplicated elements even for large size array.
