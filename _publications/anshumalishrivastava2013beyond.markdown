We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with k-way similarity functions. In this paper we focus on problems related to similarity ^3way= S_1 cup S_2 cup S_3 S_1 S_2 S_3 in where is a size n collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate ^3way similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. In the process we extend traditional framework of to handle higher order similarities which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of ^3way search is shown on the Google sets application. In addition we demonstrate the advantage of ^3way resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality.
