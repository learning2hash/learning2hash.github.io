We explore asymptotically optimal bounds for deviations of Bernoulli
convolutions from the Poisson limit in terms of the Shannon relative entropy
and the Pearson \(\chi^2\)-distance. The results are based on proper non-uniform
estimates for densities. They deal with models of non-homogeneous,
non-degenerate Bernoulli distributions.
