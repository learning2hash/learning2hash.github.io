In this technical report, we present two novel datasets for image scene
understanding. Both datasets have annotations compatible with panoptic
segmentation and additionally they have part-level labels for selected semantic
classes. This report describes the format of the two datasets, the annotation
protocols, the merging strategies, and presents the datasets statistics. The
datasets labels together with code for processing and visualization will be
published at https://github.com/tue-mps/panoptic_parts.
