We introduce a proper notion of 2-dimensional signature for images. This
object is inspired by the so-called rough paths theory, and it captures many
essential features of a 2-dimensional object such as an image. It thus serves
as a low-dimensional feature for pattern classification. Here we implement a
simple procedure for texture classification. In this context, we show that a
low dimensional set of features based on signatures produces an excellent
accuracy.
