Measuring the distance between concepts is an important field of study of
Natural Language Processing, as it can be used to improve tasks related to the
interpretation of those same concepts. WordNet, which includes a wide variety
of concepts associated with words (i.e., synsets), is often used as a source
for computing those distances. In this paper, we explore a distance for WordNet
synsets based on visual features, instead of lexical ones. For this purpose, we
extract the graphic features generated within a deep convolutional neural
networks trained with ImageNet and use those features to generate a
representative of each synset. Based on those representatives, we define a
distance measure of synsets, which complements the traditional lexical
distances. Finally, we propose some experiments to evaluate its performance and
compare it with the current state-of-the-art.
