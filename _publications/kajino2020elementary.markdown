We give an elementary self-contained proof of the fact that the walk
dimension of the Brownian motion on an arbitrary generalized Sierpi\'\{n\}ski
carpet is greater than two, no proof of which in this generality had been
available in the literature. Our proof is based solely on the self-similarity
and hypercubic symmetry of the associated Dirichlet form and on several very
basic pieces of functional analysis and the theory of regular symmetric
Dirichlet forms. We also present an application of this fact to the singularity
of the energy measures with respect to the canonical self-similar measure
(uniform distribution) in this case, proved first by M. Hino in [Probab. Theory
Related Fields 132 (2005), no. 2, 265-290].
