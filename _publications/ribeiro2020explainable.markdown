The Explainable Abstract Trains Dataset is an image dataset containing
simplified representations of trains. It aims to provide a platform for the
application and research of algorithms for justification and explanation
extraction. The dataset is accompanied by an ontology that conceptualizes and
classifies the depicted trains based on their visual characteristics, allowing
for a precise understanding of how each train was labeled. Each image in the
dataset is annotated with multiple attributes describing the trains' features
and with bounding boxes for the train elements.
