Hyperbolic machine learning is an emerging field aimed at representing data
with a hierarchical structure. However, there is a lack of tools for evaluation
and analysis of the resulting hyperbolic data representations. To this end, we
propose Hyperbolic Delaunay Geometric Alignment (HyperDGA) -- a similarity
score for comparing datasets in a hyperbolic space. The core idea is counting
the edges of the hyperbolic Delaunay graph connecting datapoints across the
given sets. We provide an empirical investigation on synthetic and real-life
biological data and demonstrate that HyperDGA outperforms the hyperbolic
version of classical distances between sets. Furthermore, we showcase the
potential of HyperDGA for evaluating latent representations inferred by a
Hyperbolic Variational Auto-Encoder.
