Metric embedding is a powerful tool used extensively in mathematics and
computer science. We devise a new method of using metric embeddings
recursively, which turns out to be particularly effective in \\(\ell_p\\) spaces,
\\(p>2\\), yielding state-of-the-art results for Lipschitz decomposition, for
Nearest Neighbor Search, and for embedding into \\(ℓ₂\\). In a nutshell, our
method composes metric embeddings by viewing them as reductions between
problems, and thereby obtains a new reduction that is substantially more
effective than the known reduction that employs a single embedding. We in fact
apply this method recursively, oftentimes using double recursion, which further
amplifies the gap from a single embedding.
