We consider the convergence of the empirical spectral measures of random \\(N
\times N\\) unitary matrices. We give upper and lower bounds showing that the
Kolmogorov distance between the spectral measure and the uniform measure on the
unit circle is of the order \\(log N / N\\), both in expectation and almost
surely. This implies in particular that the convergence happens more slowly for
Kolmogorov distance than for the \\(L_1\\)-Kantorovich distance. The proof relies
on the determinantal structure of the eigenvalue process.
