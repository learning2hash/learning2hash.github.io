Several systems have been developed to extract information about characters
to aid computational analysis of English literature. We propose character
similarity grouping as a holistic evaluation task for these pipelines. We
present AustenAlike, a benchmark suite of character similarities in Jane
Austen's novels. Our benchmark draws on three notions of character similarity:
a structurally defined notion of similarity; a socially defined notion of
similarity; and an expert defined set extracted from literary criticism.
  We use AustenAlike to evaluate character features extracted using two
pipelines, BookNLP and FanfictionNLP. We build character representations from
four kinds of features and compare them to the three AustenAlike benchmarks and
to GPT-4 similarity rankings. We find that though computational representations
capture some broad similarities based on shared social and narrative roles, the
expert pairings in our third benchmark are challenging for all systems,
highlighting the subtler aspects of similarity noted by human readers.
