In this paper we present The Rosario Dataset, a collection of sensor data for
autonomous mobile robotics in agricultural scenes. The dataset is motivated by
the lack of realistic sensor readings gathered by a mobile robot in such
environments. It consists of 6 sequences recorded in soybean fields showing
real and challenging cases: highly repetitive scenes, reflection and burned
images caused by direct sunlight and rough terrain among others. The dataset
was conceived in order to provide a benchmark and contribute to the
agricultural SLAM/odometry and sensor fusion research. It contains synchronized
readings of several sensors: wheel odometry, IMU, stereo camera and a GPS-RTK
system. The dataset is publicly available in
