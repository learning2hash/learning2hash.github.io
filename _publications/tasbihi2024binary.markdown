We generalize the shadow codes of Cherubini and Micheli to include basic
polynomials having arbitrary degree, and show that restricting basic
polynomials to have degree one or less can result in improved lower bounds on
the minimum distance of the code. However, even these improved lower bounds
suggest that shadow codes have considerably inferior distance-rate
characteristics compared with the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code
and a first-order Reed-Muller inner code.
