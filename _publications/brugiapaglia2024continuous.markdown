In this paper we prove the existence of H\"\{o\}lder continuous terminal
embeddings of any desired \(X \subseteq \mathbb\{R\}^d\) into \(\mathbb\{R\}^\{m\}\) with
\(m=\mathcal\{O\}(\epsilon^\{-2\}\omega(S_X)^2)\), for arbitrarily small
distortion \(\epsilon\), where \(\omega(S_X)\) denotes the Gaussian width of the
unit secants of \(X\). More specifically, when \(X\) is a finite set we provide
terminal embeddings that are locally \(\frac\{1\}\{2\}\)-H\"\{o\}lder almost
everywhere, and when \(X\) is infinite with positive reach we give terminal
embeddings that are locally \(\frac\{1\}\{4\}\)-H\"\{o\}lder everywhere sufficiently
close to \(X\) (i.e., within all tubes around \(X\) of radius less than \(X\)'s
reach). When \(X\) is a compact \(d\)-dimensional submanifold of \(\mathbb\{R\}^N\), an
application of our main results provides terminal embeddings into
\(\tilde\{\mathcal\{O\}\}(d)\)-dimensional space that are locally H\"\{o\}lder
everywhere sufficiently close to the manifold.
