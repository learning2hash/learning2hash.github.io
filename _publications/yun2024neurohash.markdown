Customizable image retrieval from large datasets remains a critical challenge particularly when preserving spatial relationships within images. Traditional hashing methods primarily based on deep learning often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper we introduce NeuroHash a novel neuro45;symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable spatially45;aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre45;trained deep neural network models with HDC45;based symbolic models allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self45;supervised context45;aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower45;dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance compared to state45;of45;the45;art hashing methods as measured by mAP35;64;5K scores and our newly introduced metric mAP35;64;5Kr which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHashs ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.
