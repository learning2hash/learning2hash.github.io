With the prevalence of image editing techniques, users can create fantastic
synthetic images, but the image quality may be compromised by the
color/illumination discrepancy between the manipulated region and background.
Inharmonious region localization aims to localize the inharmonious region in a
synthetic image. In this work, we attempt to leverage auxiliary style feature
to facilitate this task. Specifically, we propose a novel color mapping module
and a style feature loss to extract discriminative style features containing
task-relevant color/illumination information. Based on the extracted style
features, we also propose a novel style voting module to guide the localization
of inharmonious region. Moreover, we introduce semantic information into the
style voting module to achieve further improvement. Our method surpasses the
existing methods by a large margin on the benchmark dataset.
