Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have gained a well-deserved popularity
among machine learning tools upon their recent successful applications in
image- and sound processing and classification problems. ANNs have also been
applied for predicting the family or function of a protein, knowing its residue
sequence. Here we present two new ANNs with multi-label classification ability,
showing impressive accuracy when classifying protein sequences into 698 UniProt
families (AUC=99.99%) and 983 Gene Ontology classes (AUC=99.45%).
