The growing amount of data available in modern45;day datasets makes the need to efficiently search and retrieve information. To make large45;scale search feasible Distance Estimation and Subset Indexing are the main approaches. Although binary coding has been popular for implementing both techniques n45;ary coding (known as Product Quantization) is also very effective for Distance Estimation. However their relative performance has not been studied for Subset Indexing. We investigate whether binary or n45;ary coding works better under different retrieval strategies. This leads to the design of a new n45;ary coding method Linear Subspace Quantization (LSQ) which unlike other n45;ary encoders can be used as a similarity45;preserving embedding. Experiments on image retrieval show that when Distance Estimation is used n45;ary LSQ outperforms other methods. However when Subset Indexing is applied interestingly binary codings are more effective and binary LSQ achieves the best accuracy.
