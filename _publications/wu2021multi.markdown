Visual place recognition is one of the essential and challenging problems in
the fields of robotics. In this letter, we for the first time explore the use
of multi-modal fusion of semantic and visual modalities in dynamics-invariant
space to improve place recognition in dynamic environments. We achieve this by
first designing a novel deep learning architecture to generate the static
semantic segmentation and recover the static image directly from the
corresponding dynamic image. We then innovatively leverage the
spatial-pyramid-matching model to encode the static semantic segmentation into
feature vectors. In parallel, the static image is encoded using the popular
Bag-of-words model. On the basis of the above multi-modal features, we finally
measure the similarity between the query image and target landmark by the joint
similarity of their semantic and visual codes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for place
recognition in dynamic environments.
