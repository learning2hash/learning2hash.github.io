For \\(X(n)\\) a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, we study the maximal
size of the random Dirichlet polynomial $\\( D_N(t) = \frac1\{\sqrt\{N\}\} \sum_\{n
\leq N\} X(n) n^\{it\}, \\)\\( with \\)t\\( in various ranges. In particular, for fixed
\\)C>0\\( and any small \\)\epsilon>0\\( we show that, with high probability, \\)\\(
  \exp( (log N)^\{1/2-\epsilon\} ) \ll \sup_\{|t| \leq N^C\} |D_N(t)| \ll \exp(
(log N)^\{1/2+\epsilon\}). \\)$
