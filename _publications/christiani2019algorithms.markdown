We study the problem of approximate near neighbor (ANN) search and show the following results 45; An improved framework for solving the ANN problem using locality45;sensitive hashing reducing the number of evaluations of locality45;sensitive hash functions and the word45;RAM complexity compared to the standard framework. 45; A framework for solving the ANN problem with space45;time tradeoffs as well as tight upper and lower bounds for the space45;time tradeoff of framework solutions to the ANN problem under cosine similarity. 45; A novel approach to solving the ANN problem on sets along with a matching lower bound improving the state of the art. 45; A self45;tuning version of the algorithm is shown through experiments to outperform existing similarity join algorithms. 45; Tight lower bounds for asymmetric locality45;sensitive hashing which has applications to the approximate furthest neighbor problem orthogonal vector search and annulus queries. 45; A proof of the optimality of a well45;known Boolean locality45;sensitive hashing scheme. We study the problem of efficient algorithms for producing high45;quality pseudorandom numbers and obtain the following results 45; A deterministic algorithm for generating pseudorandom numbers of arbitrarily high quality in constant time using near45;optimal space. 45; A randomized construction of a family of hash functions that outputs pseudorandom numbers of arbitrarily high quality with space usage and running time nearly matching known cell45;probe lower bounds.
