We study the problem of approximate near neighbor (ANN) search and show the
following results:
  - An improved framework for solving the ANN problem using locality-sensitive
hashing, reducing the number of evaluations of locality-sensitive hash
functions and the word-RAM complexity compared to the standard framework.
  - A framework for solving the ANN problem with space-time tradeoffs as well
as tight upper and lower bounds for the space-time tradeoff of framework
solutions to the ANN problem under cosine similarity.
  - A novel approach to solving the ANN problem on sets along with a matching
lower bound, improving the state of the art.
  - A self-tuning version of the algorithm is shown through experiments to
outperform existing similarity join algorithms.
  - Tight lower bounds for asymmetric locality-sensitive hashing which has
applications to the approximate furthest neighbor problem, orthogonal vector
search, and annulus queries.
  - A proof of the optimality of a well-known Boolean locality-sensitive
hashing scheme.
  We study the problem of efficient algorithms for producing high-quality
pseudorandom numbers and obtain the following results:
  - A deterministic algorithm for generating pseudorandom numbers of
arbitrarily high quality in constant time using near-optimal space.
  - A randomized construction of a family of hash functions that outputs
pseudorandom numbers of arbitrarily high quality with space usage and running
time nearly matching known cell-probe lower bounds.
