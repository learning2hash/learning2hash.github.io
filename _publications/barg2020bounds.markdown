We derive bounds for the ball \\(L_p\\)-discrepancies in the Hamming space for
\\(0<p<\infty\\) and \\(p=\infty\\). Sharp estimates of discrepancies have been
obtained for many spaces such as the Euclidean spheres and more general compact
Riemannian manifolds. In the present paper, we show that the behavior of
discrepancies in the Hamming space differs fundamentally because the volume of
the ball in this space depends on its radius exponentially while such a
dependence for the Riemannian manifolds is polynomial.
