Texture can be defined as the change of image intensity that forms repetitive
patterns, resulting from physical properties of the object's roughness or
differences in a reflection on the surface. Considering that texture forms a
complex system of patterns in a non-deterministic way, biodiversity concepts
can help texture characterization in images. This paper proposes a novel
approach capable of quantifying such a complex system of diverse patterns
through species diversity and richness and taxonomic distinctiveness. The
proposed approach considers each image channel as a species ecosystem and
computes species diversity and richness measures as well as taxonomic measures
to describe the texture. The proposed approach takes advantage of ecological
patterns' invariance characteristics to build a permutation, rotation, and
translation invariant descriptor. Experimental results on three datasets of
natural texture images and two datasets of histopathological images have shown
that the proposed texture descriptor has advantages over several texture
descriptors and deep methods.
