The advent of deep perceptual networks brought about a paradigm shift in
machine vision and image perception. Image apprehension lately carried out by
hand-crafted features in the latent space have been replaced by deep features
acquired from supervised networks for improved understanding. However, such
deep networks require strict supervision with a substantial amount of the
labeled data for authentic training process. These methods perform poorly in
domains lacking labeled data especially in case of remote sensing image
retrieval. Resolving this, we propose an unsupervised encoder-decoder feature
for remote sensing image matching (RSIM). Moreover, we replace the conventional
distance metrics with a deep discriminator network to identify the similarity
of the image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, discriminator network has
never been used before for solving RSIM problem. Results have been validated
with two publicly available benchmark remote sensing image datasets. The
technique has also been investigated for content-based remote sensing image
retrieval (CBRSIR); one of the widely used applications of RSIM. Results
demonstrate that our technique supersedes the state-of-the-art methods used for
unsupervised image matching with mean average precision (mAP) of 81%, and image
retrieval with an overall improvement in mAP score of about 12%.
