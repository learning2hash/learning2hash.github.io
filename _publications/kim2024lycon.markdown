This paper addresses the unique challenge of conducting research in lyric
studies, where direct use of lyrics is often restricted due to copyright
concerns. Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected
under copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces
a novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available
Bag-of-Words (BoW) datasets, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the
lyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large
language models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and
made available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata
from renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection
Dataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe
that the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a
variety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric
generation.
