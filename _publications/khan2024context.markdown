Many artwork collections contain textual attributes that provide rich and
contextualised descriptions of artworks. Visual grounding offers the potential
for localising subjects within these descriptions on images, however, existing
approaches are trained on natural images and generalise poorly to art. In this
paper, we present CIGAr (Context-Infused GroundingDINO for Art), a visual
grounding approach which utilises the artwork descriptions during training as
context, thereby enabling visual grounding on art. In addition, we present a
new dataset, Ukiyo-eVG, with manually annotated phrase-grounding annotations,
and we set a new state-of-the-art for object detection on two artwork datasets.
