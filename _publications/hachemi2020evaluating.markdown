Humans are capable of identifying a book only by looking at its cover, but
how can computers do the same? In this paper, we explore different feature
detectors and matching methods for book cover identification, and compare their
performances in terms of both speed and accuracy. This will allow, for example,
libraries to develop interactive services based on cover book picture. Only one
single image of a cover book needs to be available through a database. Tests
have been performed by taking into account different transformations of each
book cover image. Encouraging results have been achieved.
