The recognition of texts existing in camera-captured images has become an
important issue for a great deal of research during the past few decades. This
give birth to Scene Character Recognition (SCR) which is an important step in
scene text recognition pipeline. In this paper, we extended the Bag of Features
(BoF)-based model using deep learning for representing features for accurate
SCR of different languages. In the features coding step, a deep Sparse
Auto-encoder (SAE)-based strategy was applied to enhance the representative and
discriminative abilities of image features. This deep learning architecture
provides more efficient features representation and therefore a better
recognition accuracy. Our system was evaluated extensively on all the scene
character datasets of five different languages. The experimental results proved
the efficiency of our system for a multilingual SCR.
