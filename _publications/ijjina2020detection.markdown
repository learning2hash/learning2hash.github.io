One of the basic requirements of humans is clothing and this approach aims to
identify the garments selected by customer during shopping, from surveillance
video. The existing approaches to detect garments were developed on western
wear using datasets of western clothing. They do not address Indian garments
due to the increased complexity. In this work, we propose a computer vision
based framework to address this problem through video surveillance. The
proposed framework uses the Mixture of Gaussians background subtraction
algorithm to identify the foreground present in a video frame. The visual
information present in this foreground is analysed using computer vision
techniques such as image segmentation to detect the various garments, the
customer is interested in. The framework was tested on a dataset, that
comprises of CCTV videos from a garments store. When presented with raw
surveillance footage, the proposed framework demonstrated its effectiveness in
detecting the interest of customer in choosing their garments by achieving a
high precision and recall.
