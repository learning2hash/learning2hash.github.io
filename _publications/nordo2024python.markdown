In this paper we present an open source framework developed in Python and
consisting of three distinct classes designed to manipulate in a simple and
intuitive way both symbolic representations of neutrosophic sets over universes
of various types as well as mappings between them. The capabilities offered by
this framework extend and generalize previous attempts to provide software
solutions to the manipulation of neutrosophic sets such as those proposed by
Salama et al., Saranya et al., El-Ghareeb, Topal et al. and Sleem. The code is
described in detail and many examples and use cases are also provided.
