Recent studies have shown that the environment where people eat can affect
their nutritional behaviour. In this work, we provide automatic tools for a
personalised analysis of a person's health habits by the examination of daily
recorded egocentric photo-streams. Specifically, we propose a new automatic
approach for the classification of food-related environments, that is able to
classify up to 15 such scenes. In this way, people can monitor the context
around their food intake in order to get an objective insight into their daily
eating routine. We propose a model that classifies food-related scenes
organized in a semantic hierarchy. Additionally, we present and make available
a new egocentric dataset composed of more than 33000 images recorded by a
wearable camera, over which our proposed model has been tested. Our approach
obtains an accuracy and F-score of 56% and 65%, respectively, clearly
outperforming the baseline methods.
