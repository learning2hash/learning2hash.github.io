Perceptual hashing algorithms (PHAs) are widely used for identifying illegal
online content and are thus integral to various sensitive applications.
However, due to their hasty deployment in real-world scenarios, their
adversarial security has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper assesses the
security of three widely utilized PHAs - PhotoDNA, PDQ, and NeuralHash -
against hash-evasion and hash-inversion attacks. Contrary to existing
literature, our findings indicate that these PHAs demonstrate significant
robustness against such attacks. We provide an explanation for these differing
results, highlighting that the inherent robustness is partially due to the
random hash variations characteristic of PHAs. Additionally, we propose a
defense method that enhances security by intentionally introducing
perturbations into the hashes.
