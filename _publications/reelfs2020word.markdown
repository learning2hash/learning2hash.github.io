We train word-emoji embeddings on large scale messaging data obtained from
the Jodel online social network. Our data set contains more than 40 million
sentences, of which 11 million sentences are annotated with a subset of the
Unicode 13.0 standard Emoji list. We explore semantic emoji associations
contained in this embedding by analyzing associations between emojis, between
emojis and text, and between text and emojis. Our investigations demonstrate
anecdotally that word-emoji embeddings trained on large scale messaging data
can reflect real-world semantic associations. To enable further research we
release the Jodel Emoji Embedding Dataset (JEED1488) containing 1488 emojis and
their embeddings along 300 dimensions.
