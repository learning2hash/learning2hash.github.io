To provide insight into cloth perception and manipulation with an active
binocular robotic vision system, we compiled a database of 80 stereo-pair
colour images with corresponding horizontal and vertical disparity maps and
mask annotations, for 3D garment point cloud rendering has been created and
released. The stereo-image garment database is part of research conducted under
the EU-FP7 Clothes Perception and Manipulation (CloPeMa) project and belongs to
a wider database collection released through CloPeMa (www.clopema.eu). This
database is based on 16 different off-the-shelve garments. Each garment has
been imaged in five different pose configurations on the project's binocular
robot head. A full copy of the database is made available for scientific
research only at https://sites.google.com/site/ugstereodatabase/.
