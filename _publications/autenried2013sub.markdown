In the paper we consider the Stiefel manifold \\(V_\{n;k\}\\) as a principal
\\(U(k)\\)- bundle over the Grassmann manifold and study the cut locus from the
unit element. We gave the complete description of this cut locus on \\(V_\{n;1\}\\)
and presented the sufficient condition on the general case. At the end, we
study the complement to the cut locus of \\(V_\{2k;k\}\\).
