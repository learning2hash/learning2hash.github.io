We establish a central limit theorem for counting large continued fraction
digits \((a_n)\), i.e. we count occurrences \(\\{a_n>b_n\\}\), where \((b_n)\) is a
sequence of positive integers. Our result improves a similar result by Philipp
which additionally assumes that \(b_n\) tends to infinity. Moreover, we give a
refinement of the famous Borel-Bernstein Theorem for continued fractions
regarding the event that the \(n\)-th continued fraction digit lies infinitely
often between \(d_n\) and \(d_n(1+1/c_n)\) for given sequences \((c_n)\) and \((d_n)\).
Also for these sets we obtain a central limit theorem. As an interesting side
result we determine the first \(\phi\)-mixing coefficient for the Gauss system
explicitly.
