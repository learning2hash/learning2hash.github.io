<p>Minwise hashing is the standard technique in the context of search
and databases for efficiently estimating set (e.g., high-dimensional 0/1
vector) similarities. Recently, b-bit minwise hashing was proposed which
significantly improves upon the original minwise hashing in practice by
storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value, as opposed to using
64 bits. b-bit hashing is particularly effective in applications which
mainly concern sets of high similarities (e.g., the resemblance
&gt;0.5). However, there are other important applications in which not
just pairs of high similarities matter. For example, many learning
algorithms require all pairwise similarities and it is expected that
only a small fraction of the pairs are similar. Furthermore, many
applications care more about containment (e.g., how much one object is
contained by another object) than the resemblance. In this paper, we
show that the estimators for minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing
used in the current practice can be systematically improved and the
improvements are most significant for set pairs of low resemblance and
high containment.</p>
