Let \(K\) be a convex body in \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\). Let \(X_K\) be a \(d\)-dimensional
random vector distributed according to the Hadwiger-Wills density \(\mu_K\)
associated with \(K\), defined as \(\mu_K(x)=ce^\{-\pi \{\rm dist\}^2(x,K)\}\), \(x\in
\mathbb\{R\}^d\). Finally, let the information content \(H_K\) be defined as
\(H_K=\{\rm dist\}^2(X_K,K)\). The goal of this paper is to study the fluctuations
of \(H_K\) around its expectation as the dimension \(d\) go to infinity. Relying on
Stein's method and Brascamp-Lieb inequality, we compute an explicit bound for
the total variation distance between \(H_K\) and its Gaussian counterpart.
