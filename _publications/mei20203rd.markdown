Image retrieval is a fundamental problem in computer vision. This paper
presents our 3rd place detailed solution to the Google Landmark Retrieval 2020
challenge. We focus on the exploration of data cleaning and models with metric
learning. We use a data cleaning strategy based on embedding clustering.
Besides, we employ a data augmentation method called Corner-Cutmix, which
improves the model's ability to recognize multi-scale and occluded landmark
images. We show in detail the ablation experiments and results of our method.
