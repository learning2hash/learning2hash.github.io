Digital multimedia watermarking technology had suggested in the last decade
to embed copyright information in digital objects such as images, audio and
video. However, the increasing use of relational database systems in many
real-life applications created an ever-increasing need for watermarking
database systems. As a result, watermarking relational database system is now
emerging as a research area that deals with the legal issue of copyright
protection of database systems. The main goal of database watermarking is to
generate robust and impersistent watermark for database. In this paper we
propose a method, based on image as watermark and this watermark is embedded
over the database at two different attribute of tuple, one in the numeric
attribute of tuple and another in the date attribute's time (seconds) field.
Our approach can be applied for numerical and categorical database.
