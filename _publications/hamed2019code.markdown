Code-switching (CS) is a widespread phenomenon among bilingual and
multilingual societies. The lack of CS resources hinders the performance of
many NLP tasks. In this work, we explore the potential use of bilingual word
embeddings for code-switching (CS) language modeling (LM) in the low resource
Egyptian Arabic-English language. We evaluate different state-of-the-art
bilingual word embeddings approaches that require cross-lingual resources at
different levels and propose an innovative but simple approach that jointly
learns bilingual word representations without the use of any parallel data,
relying only on monolingual and a small amount of CS data. While all
representations improve CS LM, ours performs the best and improves perplexity
33.5% relative over the baseline.
