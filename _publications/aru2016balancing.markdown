We study a higher-dimensional 'balls-into-bins' problem. An infinite sequence
of i.i.d. random vectors is revealed to us one vector at a time, and we are
required to partition these vectors into a fixed number of bins in such a way
as to keep the sums of the vectors in the different bins close together; how
close can we keep these sums almost surely? This question, our primary focus in
this paper, is closely related to the classical problem of partitioning a
sequence of vectors into balanced subsequences, in addition to having
applications to some problems in computer science.
