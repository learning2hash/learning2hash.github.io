We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the average maximal number of balls in
a bin obtained by throwing uniformly at random \(r\) balls without replacement
into \(n\) bins, \(T\) times. Writing the expected maximum as \(\frac\{r\}\{n\}T+
C_\{n,r\}\sqrt\{T\} + o(\sqrt\{T\})\), a recent preprint of Behrouzi-Far and
Zeilberger asks for an explicit expression for \(C_\{n,r\}\) in terms of \(n,r\) and
\(\pi\). In this short note, we find an expression for \(C_\{n,r\}\) in terms of \(n,
r\) and the expected maximum of \(n\) independent standard Gaussians. This
provides asymptotics for large \(n\) as well as closed forms for small \(n\)---e.g.
\(C_\{4,2\} = \frac\{3\}\{2 \pi^\{3/2\}\} \arccos(-1/3)\)---and shows that computing a
closed form for \(C_\{n,r\}\) is precisely as hard as the difficult question of
finding the expected maximum of \(n\) independent standard Gaussians.
