In this paper, a novel formulation of discrete chaotic iterations in the
field of dynamical systems is given. Their topological properties are studied:
it is mathematically proved that, under some conditions, these iterations have
a chaotic behavior in the meaning of Devaney. This chaotic behavior allows us
to propose a way to generate new hash functions. An illustration example is
detailed in order to show how to use our theoretical study in practice.
