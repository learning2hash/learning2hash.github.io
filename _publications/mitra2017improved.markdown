We propose a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) based approach for
learning local image descriptors which can be used for significantly improved
patch matching and 3D reconstructions. A multi-resolution ConvNet is used for
learning keypoint descriptors. We also propose a new dataset consisting of an
order of magnitude more number of scenes, images, and positive and negative
correspondences compared to the currently available Multi-View Stereo (MVS)
[18] dataset. The new dataset also has better coverage of the overall
viewpoint, scale, and lighting changes in comparison to the MVS dataset. We
evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets, such as Oxford Affine
Covariant Regions Dataset (ACRD) [12], MVS [18], Synthetic [6] and Strecha [15]
datasets to quantify the image descriptor performance. Scenes from the Oxford
ACRD, MVS and Synthetic datasets are used for evaluating the patch matching
performance of the learnt descriptors while the Strecha dataset is used to
evaluate the 3D reconstruction task. Experiments show that the proposed
descriptor outperforms the current state-of-the-art descriptors in both the
evaluation tasks.
