We consider the classical Skorokhod space \(D[0,1]\) and the space of
continuous functions \(C[0,1]\) equipped with the standard Skorokhod distance
\(\rho\).
  It is well known that neither \((D[0,1],\rho)\) nor \((C[0,1],\rho)\) is
complete. We provide an explicit description of the corresponding completions.
The elements of these completions can be regarded as usual functions on \([0,1]\)
except for a countable number of instants where their values vary "instantly".
