This study aims to publish a novel similarity metric to increase the speed of
comparison operations. Also the new metric is suitable for distance-based
operations among strings. Most of the simple calculation methods, such as
string length are fast to calculate but does not represent the string
correctly. On the other hand the methods like keeping the histogram over all
characters in the string are slower but good to represent the string
characteristics in some areas, like natural language. We propose a new metric,
easy to calculate and satisfactory for string comparison. Method is built on a
hash function, which gets a string at any size and outputs the most frequent K
characters with their frequencies. The outputs are open for comparison and our
studies showed that the success rate is quite satisfactory for the text mining
operations.
