We provide new simple proofs of the Kolmogorov extension theorem and
Prokhorovs' theorem. The proof of the Kolmogorov extension theorem is based on
the simple observation that \(\mathbb\{R\}\) and the product measurable space
\(\\{0,1\\}^\mathbb\{N\}\) are Borel isomorphic. To show Prokhorov's theorem, we
observe that we can assume that the underlying space is
\(\mathbb\{R\}^\mathbb\{N\}\). Then the proof of Prokhorov's theorem is a
straightforward application of the Kolmogorov extension theorem we just proved.
