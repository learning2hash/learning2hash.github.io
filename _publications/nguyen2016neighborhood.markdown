Knowledge bases are useful resources for many natural language processing
tasks, however, they are far from complete. In this paper, we define a novel
entity representation as a mixture of its neighborhood in the knowledge base
and apply this technique on TransE-a well-known embedding model for knowledge
base completion. Experimental results show that the neighborhood information
significantly helps to improve the results of the TransE model, leading to
better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on
three benchmark datasets for triple classification, entity prediction and
relation prediction tasks.
