Here, we proposed an improved version of the deterministic random extractors
\(SEJ\) and \(PEJ\) proposed by R. R. Farashahi in \cite\{F\} in 2009. By using the
Mumford's representation of a reduced divisor \(D\) of the Jacobian
\(J(\mathbb\{F\}_q)\) of a hyperelliptic curve \(\mathcal\{H\}\) of genus \(2\) with odd
characteristic, we extract a perfectly random bit string of the sum of
abscissas of rational points on \(\mathcal\{H\}\) in the support of \(D\). By this
new approach, we reduce in an elementary way the upper bound of the statistical
distance of the deterministic randomness extractors defined over \(\mathbb\{F\}_q\)
where \(q=p^n\), for some positive integer \(n\geq 1\) and \(p\) an odd prime.
