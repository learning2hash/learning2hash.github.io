We introduce a multi-modal discriminative and generative frame-work capable
of assisting humans in producing visual content re-lated to a given theme,
starting from a collection of documents(textual, visual, or both). This
framework can be used by edit or to generate images for articles, as well as
books or music album covers. Motivated by a request from the The New York Times
(NYT) seeking help to use AI to create art for their special section on
Artificial Intelligence, we demonstrated the application of our system in
producing such image.
