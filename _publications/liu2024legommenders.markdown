We present Legommenders, a unique library designed for content-based
recommendation that enables the joint training of content encoders alongside
behavior and interaction modules, thereby facilitating the seamless integration
of content understanding directly into the recommendation pipeline.
Legommenders allows researchers to effortlessly create and analyze over 1,000
distinct models across 15 diverse datasets. Further, it supports the
incorporation of contemporary large language models, both as feature encoder
and data generator, offering a robust platform for developing state-of-the-art
recommendation models and enabling more personalized and effective content
delivery.
