For avoiding the exposure of plaintexts in cloud environments, some homomorphic hashing algorithms have been proposed to generate the hash value of each plaintext, and cloud environments only store the hash values and calculate the hash values for future needs. However, longer hash value generation time and longer hash value summary time may be required by these homomorphic hashing algorithms with higher security strengths. Therefore, this study proposes a homomorphic hashing based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide a homomorphic hashing function in accordance with the characteristics of ECC. Furthermore, mathematical models and practical cases have been given to prove the proposed method. In experiments, the results show that the proposed method have higher efficiency with different security strengths.
