We prove central and local limit theorems for random walks on the
Poincar\{\'e\} hyperbolic space of dimension n \{\v e\} 2. To this end we use the
ball model and describe the walk therein through the M\{\"o\}bius addition and
multiplication. This also allows to derive a corresponding law of large
numbers.
