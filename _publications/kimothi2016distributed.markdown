Biological sequence comparison is a key step in inferring the relatedness of
various organisms and the functional similarity of their components. Thanks to
the Next Generation Sequencing efforts, an abundance of sequence data is now
available to be processed for a range of bioinformatics applications. Embedding
a biological sequence over a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet in a lower
dimensional vector space makes the data more amenable for use by current
machine learning tools, provided the quality of embedding is high and it
captures the most meaningful information of the original sequences. Motivated
by recent advances in the text document embedding literature, we present a new
method, called seq2vec, to represent a complete biological sequence in an
Euclidean space. The new representation has the potential to capture the
contextual information of the original sequence necessary for sequence
comparison tasks. We test our embeddings with protein sequence classification
and retrieval tasks and demonstrate encouraging outcomes.
