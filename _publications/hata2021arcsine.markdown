We give examples of piecewise linear random interval maps satisfying arcsine
and Darling--Kac laws, which are analogous to Thaler's arcsine and Aaronson's
Darling--Kac laws for the Boole transform. They are constructed by random
switch of two piecewise linear maps with attracting or repelling fixed points,
which behave as if they were indifferent fixed points of a deterministic map.
