Let \\(G_\{k,n\}\\) be a group of permutations of \\(kn\\) objects which permutes
things independently in disjoint blocks of size \\(k\\) and then permutes the
blocks. We investigate the probabilistic and/or enumerative aspects of random
elements of \\(G_\{k,n\}\\). This includes novel limit theorems for fixed points,
cycles of various lengths, number of cycles and inversions. The limits are
compound Poisson distributions with interesting dependence structure.
