<p>We study randomness properties of graphs and hypergraphs generated by
simple hash functions. Several hashing applications can be analyzed by
studying the structure of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-uniform
random (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-partite) hypergraphs
obtained from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> keys and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> randomly chosen hash functions <span
class="math inline">\(h_1,\dots,h_d\)</span> by associating each key
<span class="math inline">\(x\in S\)</span> with a hyperedge <span
class="math inline">\(\{h_1(x),\dots, h_d(x)\}\)</span>. Often it is
assumed that <span class="math inline">\(h_1,\dots,h_d\)</span> exhibit
a high degree of independence. We present a simple construction of a
hash class whose hash functions have small constant evaluation time and
can be stored in sublinear space. We devise general techniques to
analyze the randomness properties of the graphs and hypergraphs
generated by these hash functions, and we show that they can replace
other, less efficient constructions in cuckoo hashing (with and without
stash), the simulation of a uniform hash function, the construction of a
perfect hash function, generalized cuckoo hashing and different load
balancing scenarios.</p>
