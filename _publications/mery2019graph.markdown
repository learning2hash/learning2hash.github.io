Given an image collection of a social event with a huge number of pictures,
it is very useful to have tools that can be used to analyze how the individuals
--that are present in the collection-- interact with each other. In this paper,
we propose an optimal graph representation that is based on the `connectivity'
of them. The connectivity of a pair of subjects gives a score that represents
how `connected' they are. It is estimated based on co-occurrence, closeness,
facial expressions, and the orientation of the head when they are looking to
each other. In our proposed graph, the nodes represent the subjects of the
collection, and the edges correspond to their connectivities. The location of
the nodes is estimated according to their connectivity (the closer the nodes,
the more connected are the subjects). Finally, we developed a graphical user
interface in which we can click onto the nodes (or the edges) to display the
corresponding images of the collection in which the subject of the nodes (or
the connected subjects) are present. We present relevant results by analyzing a
wedding celebration, a sitcom video, a volleyball game and images extracted
from Twitter given a hashtag. We believe that this tool can be very helpful to
detect the existing social relations in an image collection.
