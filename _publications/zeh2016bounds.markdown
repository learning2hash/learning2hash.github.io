This paper studies bounds and constructions of locally repairable codes
(LRCs) with multiple localities so-called multiple-locality LRCs (ML-LRCs). In
the simplest case of two localities some code symbols of an ML-LRC have a
certain locality while the remaining code symbols have another one. We extend
two bounds, the Singleton and the alphabet-dependent upper bound on the
dimension of Cadambe--Mazumdar for LRCs, to the case of ML-LRCs with more than
two localities. Furthermore, we construct Singleton-optimal ML-LRCs as well as
codes that achieve the extended alphabet-dependent bound. We give a family of
binary ML-LRCs based on generalized code concatenation that is optimal with
respect to the alphabet-dependent bound.
