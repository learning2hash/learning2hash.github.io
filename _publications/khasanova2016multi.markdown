The analysis of large collections of image data is still a challenging
problem due to the difficulty of capturing the true concepts in visual data.
The similarity between images could be computed using different and possibly
multimodal features such as color or edge information or even text labels. This
motivates the design of image analysis solutions that are able to effectively
integrate the multi-view information provided by different feature sets. We
therefore propose a new image retrieval solution that is able to sort images
through a random walk on a multi-layer graph, where each layer corresponds to a
different type of information about the image data. We study in depth the
design of the image graph and propose in particular an effective method to
select the edge weights for the multi-layer graph, such that the image ranking
scores are optimised. We then provide extensive experiments in different
real-world photo collections, which confirm the high performance of our new
image retrieval algorithm that generally surpasses state-of-the-art solutions
due to a more meaningful image similarity computation.
