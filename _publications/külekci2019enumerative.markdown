Non-uniquely decodable codes can be defined as the codes that cannot be
uniquely decoded without additional disambiguation information. These are
mainly the class of non-prefix-free codes, where a codeword can be a prefix of
other(s), and thus, the codeword boundary information is essential for correct
decoding. Although the codeword bit stream consumes significantly less space
when compared to prefix--free codes, the additional disambiguation information
makes it difficult to catch the performance of prefix-free codes in total.
Previous studies considered compression with non-prefix-free codes by
integrating rank/select dictionaries or wavelet trees to mark the code-word
boundaries. In this study we focus on another dimension with a block--wise
enumeration scheme that improves the compression ratios of the previous studies
significantly. Experiments conducted on a known corpus showed that the proposed
scheme successfully represents a source within its entropy, even performing
better than the Huffman and arithmetic coding in some cases. The non-uniquely
decodable codes also provides an intrinsic security feature due to lack of
unique-decodability. We investigate this dimension as an opportunity to provide
compressed data security without (or with less) encryption, and discuss various
possible practical advantages supported by such codes.
