An information-theoretic lower bound is developed for the caching system
studied by Maddah-Ali and Niesen. By comparing the proposed lower bound with
the decentralized coded caching scheme of Maddah-Ali and Niesen, the optimal
memory--rate tradeoff is characterized to within a multiplicative gap of \(4.7\)
for the worst case, improving the previous analytical gap of \(12\). Furthermore,
for the case when users' requests follow the uniform distribution, the
multiplicative gap is tightened to \(4.7\), improving the previous analytical gap
of \(72\). As an independent result of interest, for the single-user average case
in which the user requests multiple files, it is proved that caching the most
requested files is optimal.
