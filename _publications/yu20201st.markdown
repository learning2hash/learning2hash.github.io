The 1st Tiny Object Detection (TOD) Challenge aims to encourage research in
developing novel and accurate methods for tiny object detection in images which
have wide views, with a current focus on tiny person detection. The TinyPerson
dataset was used for the TOD Challenge and is publicly released. It has 1610
images and 72651 box-levelannotations. Around 36 participating teams from the
globe competed inthe 1st TOD Challenge. In this paper, we provide a brief
summary of the1st TOD Challenge including brief introductions to the top three
methods.The submission leaderboard will be reopened for researchers that
areinterested in the TOD challenge. The benchmark dataset and other information
can be found at: https://github.com/ucas-vg/TinyBenchmark.
