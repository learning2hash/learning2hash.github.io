We present a system for identifying conceptual shifts between visual
categories, which will form the basis for a co-creative drawing system to help
users draw more creative sketches. The system recognizes human sketches and
matches them to structurally similar sketches from categories to which they do
not belong. This would allow a co-creative drawing system to produce an
ambiguous sketch that blends features from both categories.
