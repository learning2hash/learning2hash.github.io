We describe the design and use of the CREER dataset, a large corpus annotated
with rich English grammar and semantic attributes. The CREER dataset uses the
Stanford CoreNLP Annotator to capture rich language structures from Wikipedia
plain text. This dataset follows widely used linguistic and semantic
annotations so that it can be used for not only most natural language
processing tasks but also scaling the dataset. This large supervised dataset
can serve as the basis for improving the performance of NLP tasks in the
future. We publicize the dataset through the link:
