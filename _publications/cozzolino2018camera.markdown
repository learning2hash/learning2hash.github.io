Camera fingerprints are precious tools for a number of image forensics tasks.
A well-known example is the photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) noise pattern,
a powerful device fingerprint. Here, to address the image forgery localization
problem, we rely on noiseprint, a recently proposed CNN-based camera model
fingerprint. The CNN is trained to minimize the distance between same-model
patches, and maximize the distance otherwise. As a result, the noiseprint
accounts for model-related artifacts just like the PRNU accounts for
device-related non-uniformities. However, unlike the PRNU, it is only mildly
affected by residuals of high-level scene content. The experiments show that
the proposed noiseprint-based forgery localization method improves over the
PRNU-based reference.
