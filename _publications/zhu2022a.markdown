The symbol-pair code is a new coding framework proposed to guard against
pair-errors in symbol-pair read channels. Especially, a symbol-pair code with
the parameters achieving the Singleton-type bound is called an MDS symbol-pair
code. In this paper, inspiring by the classical construction for Reed-Solomon
codes, for any \(3\le k<m\le q-2\) and
\(m_1=\Big\lfloor\{\tiny\frac\{m\}\{\lfloor\frac\{k-1\}\{2\}\rfloor\}\}\Big\rfloor\), we
construct a class of \(q\)-ary MDS symbol-pair codes with dimension \(k\) and
length \(n\) \((n=m+m_1, m+m_1-1)\), where \(q\) is a prime power. Furthermore, for
\(k\in\\{3,4\\}\), the symbol-pair weight distributions for these codes are
determined by enumerating the number of polynomials with given roots.
