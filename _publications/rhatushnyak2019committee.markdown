JPEG XL is a practical approach focused on scalable web distribution and
efficient compression of high-quality images. It provides various benefits
compared to existing image formats: 60% size reduction at equivalent subjective
quality; fast, parallelizable decoding and encoding configurations; features
such as progressive, lossless, animation, and reversible transcoding of
existing JPEG with 22% size reduction; support for high-quality applications
including wide gamut, higher resolution/bit depth/dynamic range, and visually
lossless coding. The JPEG XL architecture is traditional block-transform coding
with upgrades to each component.
