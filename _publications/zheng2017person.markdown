Person re-identification (re-ID) has become increasingly popular in the
community due to its application and research significance. It aims at spotting
a person of interest in other cameras. In the early days, hand-crafted
algorithms and small-scale evaluation were predominantly reported. Recent years
have witnessed the emergence of large-scale datasets and deep learning systems
which make use of large data volumes. Considering different tasks, we classify
most current re-ID methods into two classes, i.e., image-based and video-based;
in both tasks, hand-crafted and deep learning systems will be reviewed.
Moreover, two new re-ID tasks which are much closer to real-world applications
are described and discussed, i.e., end-to-end re-ID and fast re-ID in very
large galleries. This paper: 1) introduces the history of person re-ID and its
relationship with image classification and instance retrieval; 2) surveys a
broad selection of the hand-crafted systems and the large-scale methods in both
image- and video-based re-ID; 3) describes critical future directions in
end-to-end re-ID and fast retrieval in large galleries; and 4) finally briefs
some important yet under-developed issues.
