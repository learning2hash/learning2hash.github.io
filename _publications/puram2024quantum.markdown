Jaccard Similarity is a very common proximity measurement used to compute the
similarity between two asymmetric binary vectors. Jaccard Similarity is the
ratio between the 1s (Intersection of two vectors) to 1s (Union of two
vectors). This paper introduces a quantum algorithm for finding the Jaccard
Similarity 1s, in the Intersection and Union of two binary vectors. There are
two sub-algorithms one for each. Measuring the register for respective
algorithm gives count of number of 1 s in binary format. Implementation on IBM
composer is also included.
