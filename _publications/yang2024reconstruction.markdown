Motivated by studies of data retrieval in polymer-based storage systems, we
consider the problem of reconstructing a multiset of binary strings that have
the same length and the same weight from the compositions of their prefixes and
suffixes of every possible length. We provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for which unique reconstruction up to reversal of the strings is
possible. Additionally, we present two algorithms for reconstructing strings
from the compositions of prefixes and suffixes of constant-length
constant-weight strings.
