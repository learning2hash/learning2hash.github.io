Take a continuous-time Galton-Watson tree and pick \\(k\\) distinct particles
uniformly from those alive at a time \\(T\\). What does their genealogical tree
look like? The case \\(k=2\\) has been studied by several authors, and the
near-critical asymptotics for general \\(k\\) appear in Harris, Johnston and
Roberts (2018). Here we give the full picture.
