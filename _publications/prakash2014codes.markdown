In this paper, we study codes with locality that can recover from two
erasures via a sequence of two local, parity-check computations. By a local
parity-check computation, we mean recovery via a single parity-check equation
associated to small Hamming weight. Earlier approaches considered recovery in
parallel; the sequential approach allows us to potentially construct codes with
improved minimum distance. These codes, which we refer to as locally
2-reconstructible codes, are a natural generalization along one direction, of
codes with all-symbol locality introduced by Gopalan \textit\{et al\}, in which
recovery from a single erasure is considered. By studying the Generalized
Hamming Weights of the dual code, we derive upper bounds on the minimum
distance of locally 2-reconstructible codes and provide constructions for a
family of codes based on Tur\'an graphs, that are optimal with respect to this
bound. The minimum distance bound derived here is universal in the sense that
no code which permits all-symbol local recovery from \(2\) erasures can have
larger minimum distance regardless of approach adopted. Our approach also leads
to a new bound on the minimum distance of codes with all-symbol locality for
the single-erasure case.
