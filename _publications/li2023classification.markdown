Permutation polynomials with few terms (especially permutation binomials)
attract many people due to their simple algebraic structure. Despite the great
interests in the study of permutation binomials, a complete characterization of
permutation binomials is still unknown. In this paper, we give a classification
of permutation binomials of the form \(x^i+ax\) over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^n\}\), where
\(n\leq 8\) by characterizing three new classes of permutation binomials. In
particular one of them has relatively large index \(\frac\{q^2+q+1\}\{3\}\) over
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^3\}\).
