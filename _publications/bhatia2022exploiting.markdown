Perceptual hashes map images with identical semantic content to the same n45;bit hash value while mapping semantically45;different images to different hashes. These algorithms carry important applications in cybersecurity such as copyright infringement detection content fingerprinting and surveillance. Apples NeuralHash is one such system that aims to detect the presence of illegal content on users devices without compromising consumer privacy. We make the surprising discovery that NeuralHash is approximately linear which inspires the development of novel black45;box attacks that can (i) evade detection of illegal images (ii) generate near45;collisions and (iii) leak information about hashed images all without access to model parameters. These vulnerabilities pose serious threats to NeuralHashs security goals; to address them we propose a simple fix using classical cryptographic standards.
