The \(4N\) carpets are a class of infinitely ramified self-similar fractals
with a large group of symmetries. For a \(4N\)-carpet \(F\), let \(\\{F_n\\}_\{n \geq
0\}\) be the natural decreasing sequence of compact pre-fractal approximations
with \(\cap_nF_n=F\). On each \(F_n\), let \(\mathcal\{E\}(u, v) = \int_\{F_N\} \nabla u
\cdot \nabla v \, dx\) be the classical Dirichlet form and \(u_n\) be the unique
harmonic function on \(F_n\) satisfying a mixed boundary value problem
corresponding to assigning a constant potential between two specific subsets of
the boundary. Using a method introduced by Barlow and Bass (1990), we prove a
resistance estimate of the following form: there is \(\rho=\rho(N) > 1\) such
that \(\mathcal\{E\}(u_n, u_n)\rho^\{n\}\) is bounded above and below by positive
constants independent of \(n\). Such estimates have implications for the
existence and scaling properties of Dirichlet forms on \(F\).
