View-based approach that recognizes 3D shape through its projected 2D images
achieved state-of-the-art performance for 3D shape recognition. One essential
challenge for view-based approach is how to aggregate the multi-view features
extracted from 2D images to be a global 3D shape descriptor. In this work, we
propose a novel feature aggregation network by fully investigating the
relations among views. We construct a relational graph with multi-view images
as nodes, and design relational graph embedding by modeling pairwise and
neighboring relations among views. By gradually coarsening the graph, we build
a hierarchical relational graph embedding network (HRGE-Net) to aggregate the
multi-view features to be a global shape descriptor. Extensive experiments show
that HRGE-Net achieves stateof-the-art performance for 3D shape classification
and retrieval on benchmark datasets.
