We introduce a collection of recognizing textual entailment (RTE) datasets
focused on figurative language. We leverage five existing datasets annotated
for a variety of figurative language -- simile, metaphor, and irony -- and
frame them into over 12,500 RTE examples.We evaluate how well state-of-the-art
models trained on popular RTE datasets capture different aspects of figurative
language. Our results and analyses indicate that these models might not
sufficiently capture figurative language, struggling to perform pragmatic
inference and reasoning about world knowledge. Ultimately, our datasets provide
a challenging testbed for evaluating RTE models.
