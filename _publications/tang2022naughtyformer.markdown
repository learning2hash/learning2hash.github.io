Jokes are intentionally written to be funny, but not all jokes are created
the same. Some jokes may be fit for a classroom of kindergarteners, but others
are best reserved for a more mature audience. While recent work has shown
impressive results on humor detection in text, here we instead investigate the
more nuanced task of detecting humor subtypes, especially of the less innocent
variety. To that end, we introduce a novel jokes dataset filtered from Reddit
and solve the subtype classification task using a finetuned Transformer dubbed
the Naughtyformer. Moreover, we show that our model is significantly better at
detecting offensiveness in jokes compared to state-of-the-art methods.
