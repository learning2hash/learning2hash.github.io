Robust 2004 is an information retrieval benchmark whose large number of
judgments per query make it a reliable evaluation dataset. In this paper, we
present mRobust04, a multilingual version of Robust04 that was translated to 8
languages using Google Translate. We also provide results of three different
multilingual retrievers on this dataset. The dataset is available at
