Motivation: In recent years, image-based biological assays have steadily
become high-throughput, sparking a need for fast automated methods to extract
biologically-meaningful information from hundreds of thousands of images.
Taking inspiration from the success of ImageNet, we curate CytoImageNet, a
large-scale dataset of openly-sourced and weakly-labeled microscopy images
(890K images, 894 classes). Pretraining on CytoImageNet yields features that
are competitive to ImageNet features on downstream microscopy classification
tasks. We show evidence that CytoImageNet features capture information not
available in ImageNet-trained features. The dataset is made available at
