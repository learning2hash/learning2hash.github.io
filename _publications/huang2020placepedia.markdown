Place is an important element in visual understanding. Given a photo of a
building, people can often tell its functionality, e.g. a restaurant or a shop,
its cultural style, e.g. Asian or European, as well as its economic type, e.g.
industry oriented or tourism oriented. While place recognition has been widely
studied in previous work, there remains a long way towards comprehensive place
understanding, which is far beyond categorizing a place with an image and
requires information of multiple aspects. In this work, we contribute
Placepedia, a large-scale place dataset with more than 35M photos from 240K
unique places. Besides the photos, each place also comes with massive
multi-faceted information, e.g. GDP, population, etc., and labels at multiple
levels, including function, city, country, etc.. This dataset, with its large
amount of data and rich annotations, allows various studies to be conducted.
Particularly, in our studies, we develop 1) PlaceNet, a unified framework for
multi-level place recognition, and 2) a method for city embedding, which can
produce a vector representation for a city that captures both visual and
multi-faceted side information. Such studies not only reveal key challenges in
place understanding, but also establish connections between visual observations
and underlying socioeconomic/cultural implications.
