Compressed sensing (CS) and 1-bit CS cannot directly recover quantized
signals and require time consuming recovery. In this paper, we introduce
\textit\{Hamming compressed sensing\} (HCS) that directly recovers a k-bit
quantized signal of dimensional \\(n\\) from its 1-bit measurements via invoking
\\(n\\) times of Kullback-Leibler divergence based nearest neighbor search.
Compared with CS and 1-bit CS, HCS allows the signal to be dense, takes
considerably less (linear) recovery time and requires substantially less
measurements (\\(\mathcal O(log n)\\)). Moreover, HCS recovery can accelerate the
subsequent 1-bit CS dequantizer. We study a quantized recovery error bound of
HCS for general signals and "HCS+dequantizer" recovery error bound for sparse
signals. Extensive numerical simulations verify the appealing accuracy,
robustness, efficiency and consistency of HCS.
