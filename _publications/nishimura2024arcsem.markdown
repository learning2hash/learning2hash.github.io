Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are widely renowned for their ability to
analyze the surface structures of microscopic objects, offering the capability
to capture highly detailed, yet only grayscale, images. To create more
expressive and realistic illustrations, these images are typically manually
colorized by an artist with the support of image editing software. This task
becomes highly laborious when multiple images of a scanned object require
colorization. We propose facilitating this process by using the underlying 3D
structure of the microscopic scene to propagate the color information to all
the captured images, from as little as one colorized view. We explore several
scene representation techniques and achieve high-quality colorized novel view
synthesis of a SEM scene. In contrast to prior work, there is no manual
intervention or labelling involved in obtaining the 3D representation. This
enables an artist to color a single or few views of a sequence and
automatically retrieve a fully colored scene or video. Project page:
