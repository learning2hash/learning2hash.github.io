In the context of constant--dimension subspace codes, an important problem is
to determine the largest possible size \(A_q(n, d; k)\) of codes whose codewords
are \(k\)-subspaces of \(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\) with minimum subspace distance \(d\). Here
in order to obtain improved constructions, we investigate several approaches to
combine subspace codes. This allow us to present improvements on the lower
bounds for constant--dimension subspace codes for many parameters, including
\(A_q(10, 4; 5)\), \(A_q(12, 4; 4)\), \(A_q(12, 6, 6)\) and \(A_q(16, 4; 4)\).
