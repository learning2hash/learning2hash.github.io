In this paper we examine the hash functions expressed as scalar products i.e. f(x)=<vx for some bounded random vector v. Such hash functions have numerous applications but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of v. In the present work we focus on so-called anti-concentration bounds i.e. the upper bounds of left<vx < alpha right. In many applications v is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case the distribution of <vx is also normal and it is easy to approximate left<vx < alpha right. Here we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly we analyze v being a random vector from the unit ball in l_infty and v being a random vector from the unit sphere in l_2. We show optimal up to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions f(x)=<vx. As a consequence of our research we obtain new best results for newline for l_p in high dimensional space for all pin1infty for c=Omega(maxd^1/p). These results improve over those presented in 16. Finally our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~17 who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.
