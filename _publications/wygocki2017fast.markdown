In this paper, we examine the hash functions expressed as scalar products, i.e., \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(f(x)=<v,x>\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, for some bounded random vector \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(v\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Such hash functions have numerous applications, but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(v\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. In the present work, we focus on so-called anti-concentration bounds, i.e. the upper bounds of $\mathbb\{P\}\left[|<v,x>| < \alpha \right]\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. In many applications, \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}v$ is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case, the distribution of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(<v,x>\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is also normal and it is easy to approximate $\mathbb\{P\}\left[|<v,x>| < \alpha \right]$. Here, we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly, we analyze \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(v\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} being a random vector from the unit ball in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(l\_\{\infty\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(v\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} being a random vector from the unit sphere in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(l\_\{2\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We show optimal up to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(f(x)=<v,x>\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. As a consequence of our research, we obtain new best results for \newline \textit\{\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-approximate nearest neighbors without false negatives\} for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(l\_p\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} in high dimensional space for all \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(p\in[1,\infty]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c=\Omega(\max\\{\sqrt\{d\},d^\{1/p\}\\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. These results improve over those presented in [16]. Finally, our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~[17], who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.
