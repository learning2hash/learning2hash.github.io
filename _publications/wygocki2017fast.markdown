In this paper, we examine the hash functions expressed as scalar products, i.e., \(f(x)=<v,x>\), for some bounded random vector \(v\). Such hash functions have numerous applications, but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of \(v\). In the present work, we focus on so-called anti-concentration bounds, i.e. the upper bounds of $\mathbb&amp;\#123;P&amp;\#125;\left[|<v,x>| < \alpha \right]\(. In many applications, \)v$ is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case, the distribution of \(<v,x>\) is also normal and it is easy to approximate $\mathbb&amp;\#123;P&amp;\#125;\left[|<v,x>| < \alpha \right]$. Here, we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly, we analyze \(v\) being a random vector from the unit ball in \(l\_\&amp;\#123;\infty\&amp;\#125;\) and \(v\) being a random vector from the unit sphere in \(l\_\&amp;\#123;2\&amp;\#125;\). We show optimal up to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions \(f(x)=<v,x>\). As a consequence of our research, we obtain new best results for \newline \textit&amp;\#123;\(c\)-approximate nearest neighbors without false negatives&amp;\#125; for \(l\_p\) in high dimensional space for all \(p\in[1,\infty]\), for \(c=\Omega(\max\\{\sqrt\{d\},d^\{1/p\}\\&amp;\#123;\sqrt\&amp;\#123;d\&amp;\#125;,d^\&amp;\#123;1/p\&amp;\#125;\\})\). These results improve over those presented in [16]. Finally, our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~[17], who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.
