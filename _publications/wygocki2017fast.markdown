<p>In this paper, we examine the hash functions expressed as scalar
products, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=&lt;v,x&gt;\)</span>,
for some bounded random vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.
Such hash functions have numerous applications, but often there is a
need to optimize the choice of the distribution of <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. In the present work, we focus on
so-called anti-concentration bounds, i.e.Â the upper bounds of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\left[|&lt;v,x&gt;| &lt;
\alpha \right]\)</span>. In many applications, <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is a vector of independent random
variables with standard normal distribution. In such case, the
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;v,x&gt;\)</span> is also
normal and it is easy to approximate <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\left[|&lt;v,x&gt;| &lt;
\alpha \right]\)</span>. Here, we consider two bounded distributions in
the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly, we analyze
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> being a random vector from the
unit ball in <span class="math inline">\(l_{\infty}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> being a random vector from the unit
sphere in <span class="math inline">\(l_{2}\)</span>. We show optimal up
to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=&lt;v,x&gt;\)</span>. As a consequence of our
research, we obtain new best results for for <span
class="math inline">\(l_p\)</span> in high dimensional space for all
<span class="math inline">\(p\in[1,\infty]\)</span>, for <span
class="math inline">\(c=\Omega(\max\{\sqrt{d},d^{1/p}\})\)</span>. These
results improve over those presented in [16]. Finally, our paper reports
progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~[17], who considered the
nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming
distance.</p>
