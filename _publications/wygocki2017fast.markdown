In this paper we examine the hash functions expressed as scalar products i.e. f(x)=<vx for some bounded random vector v. Such hash functions have numerous applications but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of v. In the present work we focus on so45;called anti45;concentration bounds i.e. the upper bounds of Pleft<vx < α right. In many applications v is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case the distribution of <vx is also normal and it is easy to approximate Pleft<vx < α right. Here we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti45;concentration bounds. Particularly we analyze v being a random vector from the unit ball in l95;123;∞125; and v being a random vector from the unit sphere in l95;123;2125;. We show optimal up to a constant anti45;concentration measures for functions f(x)=<vx. As a consequence of our research we obtain new best results for newline textit123;c45;approximate nearest neighbors without false negatives125; for l95;p in high dimensional space for all pin1∞ for c=Omega(max123;sqrt123;d125;d^123;1/p125;125;). These results improve over those presented in 16. Finally our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~17 who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.
