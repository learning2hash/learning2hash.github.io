We show that perceptual hashing, crucial for detecting and removing
image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) online, faces vulnerabilities from low-budget
inversion attacks based on generative AI. This jeopardizes the privacy of
users, especially vulnerable groups. We advocate to implement secure hash
matching in IBSA removal tools to mitigate potentially fatal consequences.
