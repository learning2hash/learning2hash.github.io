A kind of self-dual quasi-abelian codes of index \\(2\\) over any finite field
\\(F\\) is introduced. By counting the number of such codes and the number of the
codes of this kind whose relative minimum weights are small, such codes are
proved to be asymptotically good provided \\(-1\\) is a square in \\(F\\). Moreover, a
kind of self-orthogonal quasi-abelian codes of index \\(2\\) are defined; and such
codes always exist. In a way similar to that for self-dual quasi-abelian codes
of index \\(2\\), it is proved that the kind of the self-orthogonal quasi-abelian
codes of index \\(2\\) is asymptotically good.
