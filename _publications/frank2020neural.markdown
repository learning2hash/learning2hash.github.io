We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze authorship questions
surrounding the works of Leonardo da Vinci -- in particular, Salvator Mundi,
the world's most expensive painting and among the most controversial. Trained
on the works of an artist under study and visually comparable works of other
artists, our system can identify likely forgeries and shed light on attribution
controversies. Leonardo's few extant paintings test the limits of our system
and require corroborative techniques of testing and analysis.
