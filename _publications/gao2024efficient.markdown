A permutation code is a nonlinear code whose codewords are permutation of a
set of symbols. We consider the use of permutation code in the deletion
channel, and consider the symbol-invariant error model, meaning that the values
of the symbols that are not removed are not affected by the deletion. In 1992,
Levenshtein gave a construction of perfect single-deletion-correcting
permutation codes that attain the maximum code size. Furthermore, he showed in
the same paper that the set of all permutations of a given length can be
partitioned into permutation codes so constructed. This construction relies on
the binary Varshamov-Tenengolts codes. In this paper we give an independent and
more direct proof of Levenshtein's result that does not depend on the
Varshamov-Tenengolts code. Using the new approach, we devise efficient encoding
and decoding algorithms that correct one deletion.
