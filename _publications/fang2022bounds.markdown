Constructions of optimal locally repairable codes (LRCs) achieving
Singleton-type bound have been exhaustively investigated in recent years. In
this paper, we consider new bounds and constructions of Singleton-optimal LRCs
with minmum distance \(d=6\), locality \(r=3\) and minimum distance \(d=7\) and
locality \(r=2\), respectively. Firstly, we establish equivalent connections
between the existence of these two families of LRCs and the existence of some
subsets of lines in the projective space with certain properties. Then, we
employ the line-point incidence matrix and Johnson bounds for constant weight
codes to derive new improved bounds on the code length, which are tighter than
known results. Finally, by using some techniques of finite field and finite
geometry, we give some new constructions of Singleton-optimal LRCs, which have
larger length than previous ones.
