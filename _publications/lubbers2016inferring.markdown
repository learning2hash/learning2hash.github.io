We apply recent advances in machine learning and computer vision to a central
problem in materials informatics: The statistical representation of
microstructural images. We use activations in a pre-trained convolutional
neural network to provide a high-dimensional characterization of a set of
synthetic microstructural images. Next, we use manifold learning to obtain a
low-dimensional embedding of this statistical characterization. We show that
the low-dimensional embedding extracts the parameters used to generate the
images. According to a variety of metrics, the convolutional neural network
method yields dramatically better embeddings than the analogous method derived
from two-point correlations alone.
