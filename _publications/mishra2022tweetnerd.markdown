Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) systems are foundational
for information retrieval, question answering, event detection, and other
natural language processing (NLP) applications. We introduce TweetNERD, a
dataset of 340K+ Tweets across 2010-2021, for benchmarking NERD systems on
Tweets. This is the largest and most temporally diverse open sourced dataset
benchmark for NERD on Tweets and can be used to facilitate research in this
area. We describe evaluation setup with TweetNERD for three NERD tasks: Named
Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking with True Spans (EL), and End to End
Entity Linking (End2End); and provide performance of existing publicly
available methods on specific TweetNERD splits. TweetNERD is available at:
