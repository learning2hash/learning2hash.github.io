Let \(X_1,\ldots,X_n\) be a sequence of independent random points in
\(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) with common Lebesgue density \(f\). Under some conditions on \(f\),
we obtain a Poisson limit theorem, as \(n \to \infty\), for the number of large
probability \(k\)th-nearest neighbor balls of \(X_1,\ldots,X_n\). Our result
generalizes Theorem 2. of [10], which refers to the special case \(k=1\). Our
proof is completely different since it employs the Chen-Stein method instead of
the method of moments. Moreover, we obtain a rate of convergence for the
Poisson approximation.
