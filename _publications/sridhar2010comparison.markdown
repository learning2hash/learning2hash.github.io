In this work we have compared two indexing algorithms that have been used to
index and retrieve Carnatic music songs. We have compared a modified algorithm
of the Dual ternary indexing algorithm for music indexing and retrieval with the
multi-key hashing indexing algorithm proposed by us. The modification in the
dual ternary algorithm was essential to handle variable length query phrase and
to accommodate features specific to Carnatic music. The dual ternary indexing
algorithm is adapted for Carnatic music by segmenting using the segmentation
technique for Carnatic music. The dual ternary algorithm is compared with the
multi-key hashing algorithm designed by us for indexing and retrieval in which
features like MFCC, spectral flux, melody string and spectral centroid are used
as features for indexing data into a hash table. The way in which collision
resolution was handled by this hash table is different than the normal hash
table approaches. It was observed that multi-key hashing based retrieval had a
lesser time complexity than dual-ternary based indexing The algorithms were also
compared for their precision and recall in which multi-key hashing had a better
recall than modified dual ternary indexing for the sample data considered.
