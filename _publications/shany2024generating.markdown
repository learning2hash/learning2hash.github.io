In a paper from 2015, Ding et al. (IEEE Trans. IT, May 2015) conjectured that
for odd \(m\), the minimum distance of the binary BCH code of length \(2^m-1\) and
designed distance \(2^\{m-2\}+1\) is equal to the Bose distance calculated in the
same paper.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In fact, we prove a stronger result
suggested by Ding et al.: the weight of the generating idempotent is equal to
the Bose distance for both odd and even \(m\). Our main tools are some new
properties of the so-called fibbinary integers, in particular, the splitting
field of related polynomials, and the relation of these polynomials to the
idempotent of the BCH code.
