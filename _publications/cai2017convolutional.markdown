Successful fine-grained image classification methods learn subtle details
between visually similar (sub-)classes, but the problem becomes significantly
more challenging if the details are missing due to low resolution. Encouraged
by the recent success of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in
image classification, we propose a novel resolution-aware deep model which
combines convolutional image super-resolution and convolutional fine-grained
classification into a single model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments on the Stanford Cars and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently performs better than
conventional convolutional net on classifying fine-grained object classes in
low-resolution images.
