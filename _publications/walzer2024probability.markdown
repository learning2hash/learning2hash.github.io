Assume that \(2n\) balls are thrown independently and uniformly at random into
\(n\) bins. We consider the unlikely event \(E\) that every bin receives at least
one ball, showing that \(\Pr[E] = \Theta(b^n)\) where \(b \approx 0.836\). Note
that, due to correlations, \(b\) is not simply the probability that any single
bin receives at least one ball. More generally, we consider the event that
throwing \(\alpha n\) balls into \(n\) bins results in at least \(d\) balls in each
bin.
