The seminal work of Gatys et al. demonstrated the power of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) in creating artistic imagery by separating and
recombining image content and style. This process of using CNNs to render a
content image in different styles is referred to as Neural Style Transfer
(NST). Since then, NST has become a trending topic both in academic literature
and industrial applications. It is receiving increasing attention and a variety
of approaches are proposed to either improve or extend the original NST
algorithm. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the
current progress towards NST. We first propose a taxonomy of current algorithms
in the field of NST. Then, we present several evaluation methods and compare
different NST algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively. The review
concludes with a discussion of various applications of NST and open problems
for future research. A list of papers discussed in this review, corresponding
codes, pre-trained models and more comparison results are publicly available at
