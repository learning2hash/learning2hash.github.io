In this work, we present a new simple way to encode/decode messages
transmitted via a noisy channel and protected against errors by the Hamming
method. We also propose a fast and efficient algorithm for the encoding and the
decoding process which do not use neither the generator matrix nor the
parity-check matrix of the Hamming code.
