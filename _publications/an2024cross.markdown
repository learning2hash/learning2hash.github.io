In this work, we explore new perspectives on cross-view completion learning
by drawing an analogy to self-supervised correspondence learning. Through our
analysis, we demonstrate that the cross-attention map within cross-view
completion models captures correspondence more effectively than other
correlations derived from encoder or decoder features. We verify the
effectiveness of the cross-attention map by evaluating on both zero-shot
matching and learning-based geometric matching and multi-frame depth
estimation. Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/ZeroCo/.
