Let \(G=(S,T,E)\) be a bipartite graph. For a matching \(M\) of \(G\), let \(V(M)\)
be the set of vertices covered by \(M\), and let \(B(M)\) be the symmetric
difference of \(V(M)\) and \(S\). We prove that if \(M\) is a uniform random matching
of \(G\), then \(B(M)\) satisfies the BK inequality for increasing events.
