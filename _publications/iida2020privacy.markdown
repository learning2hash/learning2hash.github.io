In this paper, we propose a novel content based-image retrieval scheme
allowing the mixed use of encrypted and plain images for the first time. In the
proposed scheme, images are encrypted by a block-scrambling method developed
for encryption-then-compression (EtC) systems. The encrypted images, referred
to as EtC images, can be compressed with JPEG, as well as for plain images.
Image descriptors used for the proposed retrieval is designed to avoid the
effect of image encryption. As a result, the use of EtC images and the
descriptors allows us to carry out retrieval of both encrypted images and plain
ones. In an experiment, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to have the same
performance as conventional retrieval methods with plain images, even under the
mixed use of plain images and EtC ones.
