Since 2015, it has been possible to modify certain emoji with a skin tone.
The five different skin tones were introduced with the aim of representing more
human diversity, but some commentators feared they might be used as a way to
negatively represent other users/groups. This paper presents a quantitative
analysis of the use of skin tone modifiers on emoji on Twitter, showing that
users with darker-skinned profile photos employ them more often than users with
lighter-skinned profile photos, and the vast majority of skin tone usage
matches the color of a user's profile photo - i.e., tones represent the self,
rather than the other. In the few cases where users do use opposite-toned
emoji, we find no evidence of negative racial sentiment. Thus, the introduction
of skin tones seems to have met the goal of better representing human
diversity.
