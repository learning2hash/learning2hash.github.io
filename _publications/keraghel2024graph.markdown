Recent advances in machine learning, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as BERT and GPT, provide rich contextual embeddings that improve
text representation. However, current document clustering approaches often
ignore the deeper relationships between named entities (NEs) and the potential
of LLM embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and LLM embeddings within a graph-based framework for
document clustering. The method builds a graph with nodes representing
documents and edges weighted by named entity similarity, optimized using a
graph-convolutional network (GCN). This ensures a more effective grouping of
semantically related documents. Experimental results indicate that our approach
outperforms conventional co-occurrence-based methods in clustering, notably for
documents rich in named entities.
