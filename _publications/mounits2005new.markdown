Upper bounds on the maximum number of codewords in a binary code of a given
length and minimum Hamming distance are considered. New bounds are derived by a
combination of linear programming and counting arguments. Some of these bounds
improve on the best known analytic bounds. Several new record bounds are
obtained for codes with small lengths.
