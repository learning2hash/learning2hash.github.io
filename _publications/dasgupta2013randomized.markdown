The k-d tree was one of the first spatial data structures proposed for
nearest neighbor search. Its efficacy is diminished in high-dimensional spaces,
but several variants, with randomization and overlapping cells, have proved to
be successful in practice. We analyze three such schemes. We show that the
probability that they fail to find the nearest neighbor, for any data set and
any query point, is directly related to a simple potential function that
captures the difficulty of the point configuration. We then bound this
potential function in two situations of interest: the first, when data come
from a doubling measure, and the second, when the data are documents from a
topic model.
