Given an integer array A, the prefix-sum problem is to answer sum(i) queries
that return the sum of the elements in A[0..i], knowing that the integers in A
can be changed. It is a classic problem in data structure design with a wide
range of applications in computing from coding to databases. In this work, we
propose and compare several and practical solutions to this problem, showing
that new trade-offs between the performance of queries and updates can be
achieved on modern hardware.
