We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with k45;way similarity functions. In this paper we focus on problems related to emph123;345;way Jaccard125; similarity mathcal123;R125;^123;3way125;= frac123;S95;1 ∩ S95;2 ∩ S95;3125;123;S95;1 ∪ S95;2 ∪ S95;3125; S95;1 S95;2 S95;3 in mathcal123;C125; where mathcal123;C125; is a size n collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate mathcal123;R125;^123;3way125; similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to k45;way resemblance. In the process we extend traditional framework of emph123;locality sensitive hashing (LSH)125; to handle higher order similarities which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of mathcal123;R125;^123;3way125; search is shown on the Google sets application. In addition we demonstrate the advantage of mathcal123;R125;^123;3way125; resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality.
