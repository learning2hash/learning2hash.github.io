We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-way similarity functions. In this paper, we focus on problems related to \emph\{3-way Jaccard\} similarity: \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal\{R\}^\{3way\}= \frac\{|S\_1 \cap S\_2 \cap S\_3|\}\{|S\_1 \cup S\_2 \cup S\_3|\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(S\_1, S\_2, S\_3 \in \mathcal\{C\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal\{C\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is a size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal\{R\}^\{3way\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees, analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-way resemblance. In the process, we extend traditional framework of \emph\{locality sensitive hashing (LSH)\} to handle higher order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal\{R\}^\{3way\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} search is shown on the Google sets application. In addition, we demonstrate the advantage of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal\{R\}^\{3way\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality.
