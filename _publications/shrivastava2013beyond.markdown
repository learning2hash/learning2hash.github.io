<p>We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search
problems with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-way similarity
functions. In this paper, we focus on problems related to similarity:
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^{3way}= \frac{|S_1 \cap S_2 \cap
S_3|}{|S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3|}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(S_1, S_2, S_3 \in \mathcal{C}\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a size <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> collection of sets (or binary vectors).
We show that approximate <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^{3way}\)</span> similarity search
problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees, analogous to
the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend
to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-way resemblance. In the
process, we extend traditional framework of to handle higher order
similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. The
applicability of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^{3way}\)</span>
search is shown on the Google sets” application. In addition, we
demonstrate the advantage of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^{3way}\)</span> resemblance over the
pairwise case in improving retrieval quality.”</p>
