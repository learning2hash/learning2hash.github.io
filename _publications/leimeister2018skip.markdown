Recent work has demonstrated that embeddings of tree-like graphs in
hyperbolic space surpass their Euclidean counterparts in performance by a large
margin. Inspired by these results and scale-free structure in the word
co-occurrence graph, we present an algorithm for learning word embeddings in
hyperbolic space from free text. An objective function based on the hyperbolic
distance is derived and included in the skip-gram negative-sampling
architecture of word2vec. The hyperbolic word embeddings are then evaluated on
word similarity and analogy benchmarks. The results demonstrate the potential
of hyperbolic word embeddings, particularly in low dimensions, though without
clear superiority over their Euclidean counterparts. We further discuss
subtleties in the formulation of the analogy task in curved spaces.
