Recent advances in computer graphics and computer vision have found
successful application of deep neural network models for 3D shapes based on
signed distance functions (SDFs) that are useful for shape representation,
retrieval, and completion. However, this approach has been limited by the need
to have query shapes in the same canonical scale and pose as those observed
during training, restricting its effectiveness on real world scenes. We present
a formulation to overcome this issue by jointly estimating shape and similarity
transform parameters. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of this formulation on synthetic and real datasets and report favorable
comparisons to the state of the art. Finally, we also emphasize the viability
of this approach as a form of 3D model compression.
