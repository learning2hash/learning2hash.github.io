Binary descriptors of image patches provide processing speed advantages and
require less storage than methods that encode the patch appearance with a
vector of real numbers. We provide evidence that, despite its simplicity, a
stochastic hill climbing bit selection procedure for descriptor construction
defeats recently proposed alternatives on a standard discriminative power
benchmark. The method is easy to implement and understand, has no free
parameters that need fine tuning, and runs fast.
