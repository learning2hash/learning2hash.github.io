Lifted Reed-Solomon codes, a subclass of lifted affine-invariant codes, have
been shown to be of high rate while preserving locality properties similar to
generalized Reed-Muller codes, which they contain as subcodes. This work
introduces a simple bounded distance decoder for (subcodes of) lifted
affine-invariant codes that is guaranteed to decode up to almost half of their
minimum distance. Further, long \(q\)-ary lifted affine-invariant codes are shown
to correct almost all error patterns of relative weight
\(\frac\{q-1\}\{q\}-\epsilon\) for \(\epsilon>0\).
