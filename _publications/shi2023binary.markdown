The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we characterize the existence
of binary self-orthogonal codes meeting the Griesmer bound by employing
Solomon-Stiffler codes and some related residual codes. Second, using such a
characterization, we determine the exact value of \\(d_\{so\}(n,7)\\) except for five
special cases and the exact value of \\(d_\{so\}(n,8)\\) except for 41 special cases,
where \\(d_\{so\}(n,k)\\) denotes the largest minimum distance among all binary
self-orthogonal \\([n, k]\\) codes. Currently, the exact value of \\(d_\{so\}(n,k)\\) \\((k
\le 6)\\) was determined by Shi et al. (2022). In addition, we develop a general
method to prove the nonexistence of some binary self-orthogonal codes by
considering the residual code of a binary self-orthogonal code.
