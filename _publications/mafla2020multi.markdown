Scene text instances found in natural images carry explicit semantic
information that can provide important cues to solve a wide array of computer
vision problems. In this paper, we focus on leveraging multi-modal content in
the form of visual and textual cues to tackle the task of fine-grained image
classification and retrieval. First, we obtain the text instances from images
by employing a text reading system. Then, we combine textual features with
salient image regions to exploit the complementary information carried by the
two sources. Specifically, we employ a Graph Convolutional Network to perform
multi-modal reasoning and obtain relationship-enhanced features by learning a
common semantic space between salient objects and text found in an image. By
obtaining an enhanced set of visual and textual features, the proposed model
greatly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in two different tasks,
fine-grained classification and image retrieval in the Con-Text and Drink
Bottle datasets.
