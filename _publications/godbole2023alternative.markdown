Let \\(\pi_n\\) be a uniformly chosen random permutation on \\([n]\\). Using an
analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive \\(k\\)-permutations
are order isomorphic, the authors of a recent paper showed that the expected
number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths \\(k\in\\{1,2,\ldots,n\\}\\)
in \\(\pi_n\\) is \\(\frac\{n^2\}\{2\}(1-o(1))\\) as \\(n\to\infty\\). This exhibited the fact
that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. We use
entirely different methods, namely the Stein-Chen method of Poisson
approximation, to reprove and slightly improve their result.
