In the large45;scale image retrieval task the two most important requirements are the discriminability of image representations and the efficiency in computation and storage of representations. Regarding the former requirement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proven to be a very powerful tool to extract highly discriminative local descriptors for effective image search. Additionally in order to further improve the discriminative power of the descriptors recent works adopt fine45;tuned strategies. In this paper taking a different approach we propose a novel computationally efficient and competitive framework. Specifically we firstly propose various strategies to compute masks namely SIFT45;mask SUM45;mask and MAX45;mask to select a representative subset of local convolutional features and eliminate redundant features. Our in45;depth analyses demonstrate that proposed masking schemes are effective to address the burstiness drawback and improve retrieval accuracy. Secondly we propose to employ recent embedding and aggregating methods which can significantly boost the feature discriminability. Regarding the computation and storage efficiency we include a hashing module to produce very compact binary image representations. Extensive experiments on six image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves the state45;of45;the45;art retrieval performances.
