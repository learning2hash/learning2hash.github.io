"No two rainbows are the same. Neither are two packs of Skittles. Enjoy an
odd mix!". Using an interpretation via spatial random walks, we quantify the
probability that two randomly selected packs of Skittles candy are identical
and determine the expected number of packs one has to purchase until the first
match. We believe this problem to be appealing for middle and high school
students as well as undergraduate students at University.
