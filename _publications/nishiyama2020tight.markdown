The binary divergences that are divergences between probability measures
defined on the same 2-point set have an interesting property. For the
chi-squared divergence and the relative entropy, it is known that their binary
divergence attain lower bounds with given means and variances, respectively. In
this note, we show that the binary divergence of the squared Hellinger distance
has the same property and propose an open problem that what conditions are
needed for f-divergence to satisfy this property.
