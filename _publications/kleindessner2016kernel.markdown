Given only information in the form of similarity triplets "Object A is more
similar to object B than to object C" about a data set, we propose two ways of
defining a kernel function on the data set. While previous approaches construct
a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the data set that reflects the given
similarity triplets, we aim at defining kernel functions that correspond to
high-dimensional embeddings. These kernel functions can subsequently be used to
apply any kernel method to the data set.
