In this paper we propose a two-step iterative scheme Graph Regularised Hashing (GRH) for incrementally adjusting the positioning of the hashing hypersurfaces to better conform to the supervisory signal in the first step the binary bits are regularised using a data similarity graph so that similar data points receive similar bits. In the second step the regularised hashcodes form targets for a set of binary classifiers which shift the position of each hypersurface so as to separate opposite bits with maximum margin. GRH exhibits superior retrieval accuracy to competing hashing methods.
