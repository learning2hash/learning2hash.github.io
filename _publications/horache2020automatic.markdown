The recognition and clustering of coins which have been struck by the same
die is of interest for archeological studies. Nowadays, this work can only be
performed by experts and is very tedious. In this paper, we propose a method to
automatically cluster dies, based on 3D scans of coins. It is based on three
steps: registration, comparison and graph-based clustering. Experimental
results on 90 coins coming from a Celtic treasury from the II-Ith century BC
show a clustering quality equivalent to expert's work.
