Personalized fashion recommendation is a difficult task because 1) the
decisions are highly correlated with users' aesthetic appetite, which previous
work frequently overlooks, and 2) many new items are constantly rolling out
that cause strict cold-start problems in the popular identity (ID)-based
recommendation methods. These new items are critical to recommend because of
trend-driven consumerism. In this work, we aim to provide more accurate
personalized fashion recommendations and solve the cold-start problem by
converting available information, especially images, into two attribute graphs
focusing on optimized image utilization and noise-reducing user modeling.
Compared with previous methods that separate image and text as two components,
the proposed method combines image and text information to create a richer
attributes graph. Capitalizing on the advancement of large language and vision
models, we experiment with extracting fine-grained attributes efficiently and
as desired using two different prompts. Preliminary experiments on the IQON3000
dataset have shown that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy
compared with baselines.
