Zero-shot learning transfers knowledge from seen classes to novel unseen
classes to reduce human labor of labelling data for building new classifiers.
Much effort on zero-shot learning however has focused on the standard
multi-class setting, the more challenging multi-label zero-shot problem has
received limited attention. In this paper we propose a transfer-aware embedding
projection approach to tackle multi-label zero-shot learning. The approach
projects the label embedding vectors into a low-dimensional space to induce
better inter-label relationships and explicitly facilitate information transfer
from seen labels to unseen labels, while simultaneously learning a max-margin
multi-label classifier with the projected label embeddings. Auxiliary
information can be conveniently incorporated to guide the label embedding
projection to further improve label relation structures for zero-shot knowledge
transfer. We conduct experiments for zero-shot multi-label image
classification. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
