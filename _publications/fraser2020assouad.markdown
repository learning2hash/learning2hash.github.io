This is a book to be published in 2020 by Cambridge University Press (Tracts
in Mathematics Series). It focuses on the Assouad dimension of sets and
measures in Euclidean space, as well as many variants on the Assouad dimension,
including the lower dimension and Assouad spectrum. It considers these notions
in the setting of fractal geometry and topics covered include: weak tangents,
self-similar sets, self-affine sets, Mandelbrot percolation, limit sets of
Kleinian groups, orthogonal projections, distance sets, and Kakeya sets. It
also considers applications of these ideas to other areas, including: embedding
theory, number theory, probability theory and functional analysis. It ends with
a list of open problems.
