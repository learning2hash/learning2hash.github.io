Multi-modal large language models are regarded as a crucial step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and have garnered significant interest with the emergence of ChatGPT. However current speech-language models typically adopt the cascade paradigm preventing inter-modal knowledge transfer. In this paper we propose SpeechGPT a large language model with intrinsic cross-modal conversational abilities capable of perceiving and generating multi-model content. With discrete speech representations we first construct SpeechInstruct a large-scale cross-modal speech instruction dataset. Additionally we employ a three-stage training strategy that includes modality-adaptation pre-training cross-modal instruction fine-tuning and chain-of-modality instruction fine-tuning. The experimental results demonstrate that SpeechGPT has an impressive capacity to follow multi-modal human instructions and highlight the potential of handling multiple modalities with one model.
