Fashion is one of the ways in which we show ourselves to the world. It is a
reflection of our personal decisions and one of the ways in which people
distinguish and represent themselves. In this paper, we focus on the fashion
design process and expand computer vision for fashion beyond its current focus
on western fashion. We discuss the history of Southern African se-Shweshwe
fabric fashion, the collection of a se-Shweshwe dataset, and the application of
sketch-to-design image generation for affordable fashion-design. The
application to fashion raises both technical questions of training with small
amounts of data, and also important questions for computer vision beyond
fairness, in particular ethical considerations on creating and employing
fashion datasets, and how computer vision supports cultural representation and
might avoid algorithmic cultural appropriation.
