A novel color feature descriptor, Multichannel Distributed Local Pattern
(MDLP) is proposed in this manuscript. The MDLP combines the salient features
of both local binary and local mesh patterns in the neighborhood. The
multi-distance information computed by the MDLP aids in robust extraction of
the texture arrangement. Further, MDLP features are extracted for each color
channel of an image. The retrieval performance of the MDLP is evaluated on the
three benchmark datasets for CBIR, namely Corel-5000, Corel-10000 and MIT-Color
Vistex respectively. The proposed technique attains substantial improvement as
compared to other state-of- the-art feature descriptors in terms of various
evaluation parameters such as ARP and ARR on the respective databases.
