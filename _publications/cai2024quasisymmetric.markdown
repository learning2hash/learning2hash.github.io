We initiate a study of the quasisymmetric uniformization of naturally arising
random fractals and show that many of them fall outside the realm of
quasisymmetric uniformization to simple canonical spaces. We begin with the
trace, the graph of Brownian motion, and various variants of the
Schramm-Loewner evolution \(\mathrm\{SLE\}_\kappa\) for \(\kappa>0\), and show that
a.s. neither is a quasiarc. After that, we study the conformal loop ensemble
\(\mathrm\{CLE\}_\kappa\), \(\kappa \in (\frac\{8\}\{3\}, 4]\), and show that the
collection of all points outside the loops is a.s. homeomorphic to the standard
Sierpi\'nski carpet, but not quasisymmetrically equivalent to a round carpet.
