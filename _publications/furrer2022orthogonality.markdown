For a stationary random function \\(\xi\\), sampled on a subset \\(D\\) of
\\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\\), we examine the equivalence and orthogonality of two zero-mean
Gaussian measures \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{1\}\\) and \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{2\}\\) associated with \\(\xi\\).
We give the isotropic analog to the result that the equivalence of
\\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{1\}\\) and \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{2\}\\) is linked with the existence of a
square-integrable extension of the difference between the covariance functions
of \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{1\}\\) and \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{2\}\\) from \\(D\\) to \\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\\). We show
that the orthogonality of \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{1\}\\) and \\(\mathbb\{P\}_\{2\}\\) can be
recovered when the set of distances from points of \\(D\\) to the origin is dense
in the set of non-negative real numbers.
