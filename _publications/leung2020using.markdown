This paper investigates the causality in the decision making of movie
recommendations through the users' affective profiles. We advocate a method of
assigning emotional tags to a movie by the auto-detection of the affective
features in the movie's overview. We apply a text-based Emotion Detection and
Recognition model, which trained by tweets short messages and transfers the
learned model to detect movie overviews' implicit affective features. We
vectorized the affective movie tags to represent the mood embeddings of the
movie. We obtain the user's emotional features by taking the average of all the
movies' affective vectors the user has watched. We apply five-distance metrics
to rank the Top-N movie recommendations against the user's emotion profile. We
found Cosine Similarity distance metrics performed better than other distance
metrics measures. We conclude that by replacing the top-N recommendations
generated by the Recommender with the reranked recommendations list made by the
Cosine Similarity distance metrics, the user will effectively get affective
aware top-N recommendations while making the Recommender feels like an Emotion
Aware Recommender.
