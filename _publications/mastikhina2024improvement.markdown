This paper examines the graph partition problem and introduces a new metric,
MSIDS (maximal sum of inner degrees squared). We establish its connection to
the replication factor (RF) optimization, which has been the main focus of
theoretical work in this field. Additionally, we propose a new partition
algorithm, DBH-X, based on the DBH partitioner. We demonstrate that DBH-X
significantly improves both the RF and MSIDS, compared to the baseline DBH
algorithm. In addition, we provide test results that show the runtime
acceleration of GraphX-based PageRank and Label propagation algorithms.
