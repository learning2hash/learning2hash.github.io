The Half-Plane Half-Comb walk is a random walk on the plane, when we have a
square lattice on the upper half-plane and a comb structure on the lower
half-plane, i.e. horizontal lines below the x-axis are removed. We prove that
the probability that this walk returns to the origin in 2N steps is
asymptotically equal to 2/(\pi N). As15 pag a consequence we prove strong laws
and a limit distribution for the local time.
