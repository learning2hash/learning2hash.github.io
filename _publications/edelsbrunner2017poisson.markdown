The order-\\(k\\) Voronoi tessellation of a locally finite set \\(X \subseteq
\mathbb\{R\}^n\\) decomposes \\(\mathbb\{R\}^n\\) into convex domains whose points have
the same \\(k\\) nearest neighbors in \\(X\\). Assuming \\(X\\) is a stationary Poisson
point process, we give explicit formulas for the expected number and total area
of faces of a given dimension per unit volume of space. We also develop a
relaxed version of discrete Morse theory and generalize by counting only faces,
for which the \\(k\\) nearest points in \\(X\\) are within a given distance threshold.
