Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to
compact binary codes that are able to preserve label based
similarity in the Hamming space. Non-linear hash functions
have demonstrated their advantage over linear ones due to
their powerful generalization capability. In the literature,
kernel functions are typically used to achieve non-linearity
in hashing, which achieve encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training time.
Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving
non-linearity in hashing, which are fast to train and evaluate, hence more suitable for hashing with high dimensional
data. In our approach, we first propose sub-modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem
and an efficient GraphCut based block search method for
solving large-scale inference.
Then we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the binary
codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in
retrieval precision and training time. Especially for highdimensional data, our method is orders of magnitude faster
than many methods in terms of training time.
