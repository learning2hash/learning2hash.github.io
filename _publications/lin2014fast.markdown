Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact binary codes that are able to preserve label based similarity in the Hamming space. Non45;linear hash functions have demonstrated the advantage over linear ones due to their powerful generalization capability. In the literature kernel functions are typically used to achieve non45;linearity in hashing which achieve encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training time. Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving non45;linearity in hashing which are fast to train and evaluate hence more suitable for hashing with high dimensional data. In our approach we first propose sub45;modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem and an efficient GraphCut based block search method for solving large45;scale inference. Then we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the binary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms most state45;of45;the45;art methods in retrieval precision and training time. Especially for high45;dimensional data our method is orders of magnitude faster than many methods in terms of training time.
