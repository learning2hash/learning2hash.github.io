We propose a new scheme for sharing symmetric key operations among a set of
participants according to a (t,n) threshold access structure. We focus on
anonymity properties of this scheme and show that this scheme provides improved
values of anonymity measures than the existing ones. In particular, the scheme
can provide optimal and equitable participant anonymity when it is based on
balanced perfect hash families.
