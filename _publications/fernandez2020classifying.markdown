One of the tasks of law enforcement agencies is to find evidence of criminal
activity in the Darknet. However, visiting thousands of domains to locate
visual information containing illegal acts manually requires a considerable
amount of time and resources. Furthermore, the background of the images can
pose a challenge when performing classification. To solve this problem, in this
paper, we explore the automatic classification Tor Darknet images using
Semantic Attention Keypoint Filtering, a strategy that filters non-significant
features at a pixel level that do not belong to the object of interest, by
combining saliency maps with Bag of Visual Words (BoVW). We evaluated SAKF on a
custom Tor image dataset against CNN features: MobileNet v1 and Resnet50, and
BoVW using dense SIFT descriptors, achieving a result of 87.98% accuracy and
outperforming all other approaches.
