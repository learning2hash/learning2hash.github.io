Let Z be the zero set of a holomorphic map from C^n to C^k. Assume that Z is
non-empty. We prove that for any r > 0, the Gaussian measure of the Euclidean
r-neighborhood of Z is at least as large as the Gaussian measure of the
Euclidean r-neighborhood of E, where E is any (n-k)-dimensional, affine,
complex subspace whose distance from the origin is the same as the distance of
Z from the origin.
