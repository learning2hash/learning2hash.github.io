We show that for every \(k\)-dimensional linear code \(\mathcal\{C\} \subseteq
\mathbb\{F\}_2^n\) there exists a set \(S\subseteq [n]\) of size at most
\(n/2+O(\sqrt\{nk\})\) such that the projection of \(\mathcal\{C\}\) onto \(S\) has
distance at least \(\frac12\mathrm\{dist\}(\mathcal\{C\})\). As a consequence we show
that any connected graph \(G\) with \(m\) edges and \(n\) vertices has at least
\(2^\{m-(n-1)\}\) many \(1/2\)-thin subgraphs.
