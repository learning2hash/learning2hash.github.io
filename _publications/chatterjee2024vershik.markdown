Let \(G_\{n,k\}\) be the group of permutations of \(\\{1,2,\ldots, kn\\}\) that
permutes the first \(k\) symbols arbitrarily, then the next \(k\) symbols and so on
through the last \(k\) symbols. Finally the \(n\) blocks of size \(k\) are permuted
in an arbitrary way. For \(\sigma\) chosen uniformly in \(G_\{n,k\}\), let \(L_\{n,k\}\)
be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in \(\sigma\). For \(k,n\)
growing, we determine that the limiting mean of \(L_\{n,k\}\) is asymptotic to
\(4\sqrt\{nk\}\). This is different from parallel variations of the Vershik-Kerov
theorem for colored permutations.
