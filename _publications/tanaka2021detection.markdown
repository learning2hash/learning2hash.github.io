In this paper we investigate whether robust hashing has a possibility to robustly detect fake45;images even when multiple manipulation techniques such as JPEG compression are applied to images for the first time. In an experiment the proposed fake detection with robust hashing is demonstrated to outperform state45;of45;the45;art one under the use of various datasets including fake images generated with GANs.
