Over the last decade, deep learning has shown great success at performing
computer vision tasks, including classification, super-resolution, and style
transfer. Now, we apply it to data compression to help build the next
generation of multimedia codecs. This thesis provides three primary
contributions to this new field of learned compression. First, we present an
efficient low-complexity entropy model that dynamically adapts the encoding
distribution to a specific input by compressing and transmitting the encoding
distribution itself as side information. Secondly, we propose a novel
lightweight low-complexity point cloud codec that is highly specialized for
classification, attaining significant reductions in bitrate compared to
non-specialized codecs. Lastly, we explore how motion within the input domain
between consecutive video frames is manifested in the corresponding
convolutionally-derived latent space.
