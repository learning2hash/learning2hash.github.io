Interpreting remote sensing imagery enables numerous downstream applications
ranging from land-use planning to deforestation monitoring. Robustly
classifying this data is challenging due to the Earth's geographic diversity.
While many distinct satellite and aerial image classification datasets exist,
there is yet to be a benchmark curated that suitably covers this diversity. In
this work, we introduce SATellite ImageNet (SATIN), a metadataset curated from
27 existing remotely sensed datasets, and comprehensively evaluate the
zero-shot transfer classification capabilities of a broad range of
vision-language (VL) models on SATIN. We find SATIN to be a challenging
benchmark-the strongest method we evaluate achieves a classification accuracy
of 52.0%. We provide a \(\href\{https://satinbenchmark.github.io\}\{\text\{public
leaderboard\}\}\) to guide and track the progress of VL models in this important
domain.
