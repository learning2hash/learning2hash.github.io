We performed pairwise comparisons by human raters of JPEG images from
MozJPEG, libjpeg-turbo and our new Jpegli encoder. When compressing images at a
quality similar to libjpeg-turbo quality 95, the Jpegli images were 54% likely
to be preferred over both libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG images, but used only 2.8
bits per pixel compared to libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG that used 3.8 and 3.5 bits
per pixel respectively. The raw ratings and source images are publicly
available for further analysis and study.
