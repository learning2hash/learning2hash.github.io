Recently, the discovery of interpretable directions in the latent spaces of
pre-trained GANs has become a popular topic. While existing works mostly
consider directions for semantic image manipulations, we focus on an abstract
property: creativity. Can we manipulate an image to be more or less creative?
We build our work on the largest AI-based creativity platform, Artbreeder,
where users can generate images using pre-trained GAN models. We explore the
latent dimensions of images generated on this platform and present a novel
framework for manipulating images to make them more creative. Our code and
dataset are available at http://github.com/catlab-team/latentcreative.
