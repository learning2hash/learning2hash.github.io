Recently, some infinite families of binary minimal and optimal linear codes
are constructed from simplicial complexes by Hyun \{\em et al\}. Inspired by
their work, we present two new constructions of codes over the ring \(\Bbb
F_2+u\Bbb F_2\) by employing simplicial complexes. When the simplicial complexes
are all generated by a maximal element, we determine the Lee weight
distributions of two classes of the codes over \(\Bbb F_2+u\Bbb F_2\). Our
results show that the codes have few Lee weights. Via the Gray map, we obtain
an infinite family of binary codes meeting the Griesmer bound and a class of
binary distance optimal codes.
