We have developed and tested in numerical experiments a universal approach to
searching objects of a given type in captured video images (for example,
people's faces, vehicles, special characters, numbers and letters, etc.). The
novelty and versatility of this approach consists in a unique combination of
the well-known methods ranging from creating detectors to making decisions
independent of the type of recognition objects. The efficiencies of various
types of basic features used for image coding, including the Haar features, the
LBP features, and the modified Census transformation are compared. A
combination of the modified methods is used for constructing 11 types of
detectors of the number of railway carriages and for recognizing digits from
zero to nine. The efficiency of the constructed detectors is studied.
