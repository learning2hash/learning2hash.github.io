We introduce Audio Atlas, an interactive web application for visualizing
audio data using text-audio embeddings. Audio Atlas is designed to facilitate
the exploration and analysis of audio datasets using a contrastive embedding
model and a vector database for efficient data management and semantic search.
The system maps audio embeddings into a two-dimensional space and leverages
DeepScatter for dynamic visualization. Designed for extensibility, Audio Atlas
allows easy integration of new datasets, enabling users to better understand
their audio data and identify both patterns and outliers. We open-source the
codebase of Audio Atlas, and provide an initial implementation containing
various audio and music datasets.
