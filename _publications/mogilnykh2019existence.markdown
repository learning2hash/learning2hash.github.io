A pair \\((T_0,T_1)\\) of disjoint sets of vertices of a graph \\(G\\) is called a
perfect bitrade in \\(G\\) if any ball of radius 1 in \\(G\\) contains exactly one
vertex in \\(T_0\\) and \\(T_1\\) or none simultaneously. The volume of a perfect
bitrade \\((T_0,T_1)\\) is the size of \\(T_0\\). In particular, if \\(C_0\\) and \\(C_1\\) are
distinct perfect codes with minimum distance \\(3\\) in \\(G\\) then \\((C_0\setminus
C_1,C_1\setminus C_0)\\) is a perfect bitrade. For any \\(q\geq 3\\), \\(r\geq 1\\) we
construct perfect bitrades in the Hamming graph \\(H(qr+1,q)\\) of volume \\((q!)^r\\)
and show that for \\(r=1\\) their volume is minimum.
