Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been serving as general-purpose
interfaces, posing a significant demand for comprehensive visual knowledge.
However, it remains unclear how well current LLMs and their visually augmented
counterparts (VaLMs) can master visual commonsense knowledge. To investigate
this, we propose ImageNetVC, a human-annotated dataset specifically designed
for zero- and few-shot visual commonsense evaluation across 1,000 ImageNet
categories. Utilizing ImageNetVC, we benchmark the fundamental visual
commonsense knowledge of both unimodal LLMs and VaLMs. Furthermore, we analyze
the factors affecting the visual commonsense knowledge of large-scale models,
providing insights into the development of language models enriched with visual
commonsense knowledge. Our code and dataset are available at
