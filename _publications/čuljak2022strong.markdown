Named entity linking (NEL) in news is a challenging endeavour due to the
frequency of unseen and emerging entities, which necessitates the use of
unsupervised or zero-shot methods. However, such methods tend to come with
caveats, such as no integration of suitable knowledge bases (like Wikidata) for
emerging entities, a lack of scalability, and poor interpretability. Here, we
consider person disambiguation in Quotebank, a massive corpus of
speaker-attributed quotations from the news, and investigate the suitability of
intuitive, lightweight, and scalable heuristics for NEL in web-scale corpora.
Our best performing heuristic disambiguates 94% and 63% of the mentions on
Quotebank and the AIDA-CoNLL benchmark, respectively. Additionally, the
proposed heuristics compare favourably to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and
zero-shot methods, Eigenthemes and mGENRE, respectively, thereby serving as
strong baselines for unsupervised and zero-shot entity linking.
