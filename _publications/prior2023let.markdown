<p>The ongoing Big Data explosion has created a demand for efficient and
scalable algorithms for similarity search. Most recent work has focused
on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-NN search, and while this may
be sufficient for some applications, <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-NN search would be ideal for many
applications. We present CAKES, a set of three novel, exact algorithms
for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-NN search. CAKESâ€™s algorithms
are generic over distance function, and they scale with the cardinality
or embedding dimension of the dataset, but rather with its metric
entropy and fractal dimension. We test these claims on datasets from the
ANN-Benchmarks suite under commonly-used distance functions, as well as
on a genomic dataset with Levenshtein distance and a radio-frequency
dataset with Dynamic Time Warping distance. We demonstrate that CAKES
exhibits near-constant scaling with cardinality on data conforming to
the manifold hypothesis, and has perfect recall on data in spaces. We
also demonstrate that CAKES exhibits significantly higher recall than
state-of-the-art <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-NN search
algorithms when the distance function is not a metric. Additionally, we
show that indexing and tuning time for CAKES is an order of magnitude,
or more, faster than state-of-the-art approaches. We conclude that CAKES
is a highly efficient and scalable algorithm for exact <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-NN search on Big Data. We provide a
Rust implementation of CAKES.</p>
