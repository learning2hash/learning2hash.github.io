Recent cryptanalytic attacks have exposed the vulnerabilities of some widely
used cryptographic hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1. Attacks in the line of
differential attacks have been used to expose the weaknesses of several other
hash functions like RIPEMD, HAVAL. In this paper we propose a new efficient
hash algorithm that provides a near random hash output and overcomes some of
the earlier weaknesses. Extensive simulations and comparisons with some
existing hash functions have been done to prove the effectiveness of the BSA,
which is an acronym for the name of the 3 authors.
