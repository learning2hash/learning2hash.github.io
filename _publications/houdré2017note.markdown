We address a question and a conjecture on the expected length of the longest
common subsequences of two i.i.d.\\(\ \\)random permutations of
\\([n]:=\\{1,2,...,n\\}\\). The question is resolved by showing that the minimal
expectation is not attained in the uniform case. The conjecture asserts that
\\(\sqrt\{n\}\\) is a lower bound on this expectation, but we only obtain
\\(\sqrt[3]\{n\}\\) for it.
