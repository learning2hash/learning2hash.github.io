Online academic profiles are used by scholars to reflect a desired image to
their online audience. In Google Scholar, scholars can select a subset of
co-authors for presentation in a central location on their profile using a
social feature called the Co-authroship panel. In this work, we examine whether
scientometrics and reciprocality can explain the observed selections. To this
end, we scrape and thoroughly analyze a novel set of 120,000 Google Scholar
profiles, ranging across four disciplines and various academic institutions.
Our results suggest that scholars tend to favor co-authors with higher
scientometrics over others for inclusion in their co-authorship panels.
Interestingly, as one's own scientometrics are higher, the tendency to include
co-authors with high scientometrics is diminishing. Furthermore, we find that
reciprocality is central to explaining scholars' selections.
