We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the approximation, Gelfand and
Kolmogorov numbers of compact embeddings between 2-microlocal Besov spaces with
weights defined in terms of the distance to a \\(d\\)-set \\(U\subset \mathbb\{R\}^n\\).
The sharp estimates are shown in most cases, where the quasi-Banach setting is
included.
