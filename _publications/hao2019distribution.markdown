In this paper, we study the distribution of the minimal distance (in the
Hamming metric) of a random linear code of dimension \(k\) in \(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\).
We provide quantitative estimates showing that the distribution function of the
minimal distance is close (\{\it\{\}superpolynomially\} in \(n\))to the cumulative
distribution function of the minimum of \((q^k-1)/(q-1)\) independent binomial
random variables with parameters \(\frac\{1\}\{q\}\) and \(n\). The latter, in turn,
converges to a Gumbel distribution at integer points when \(\frac\{k\}\{n\}\)
converges to a fixed number in \((0,1)\). Our result confirms in a strong sense
that apart from identification of the weights of proportional codewords, the
probabilistic dependencies introduced by the linear structure of the random
code, produce a negligible effect on the minimal code weight. As a corollary of
the main result, we obtain an improvement of the Gilbert--Varshamov bound for
\(2<q<49\).
