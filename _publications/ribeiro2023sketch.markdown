Sketch-an-Anchor is a novel method to train state-of-the-art Zero-shot
Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZSSBIR) models in under an epoch. Most studies
break down the problem of ZSSBIR into two parts: domain alignment between
images and sketches, inherited from SBIR, and generalization to unseen data,
inherent to the zero-shot protocol. We argue one of these problems can be
considerably simplified and re-frame the ZSSBIR problem around the
already-stellar yet underexplored Zero-shot Image-based Retrieval performance
of off-the-shelf models. Our fast-converging model keeps the single-domain
performance while learning to extract similar representations from sketches. To
this end we introduce our Semantic Anchors -- guiding embeddings learned from
word-based semantic spaces and features from off-the-shelf models -- and
combine them with our novel Anchored Contrastive Loss. Empirical evidence shows
we can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark datasets while
training for 100x less iterations than other methods.
