Anonymization technique has been extensively studied and widely applied for
privacy-preserving data publishing. In most previous approaches, a microdata
table consists of three categories of attribute: explicit-identifier,
quasi-identifier (QI), and sensitive attribute. Actually, different individuals
may have different view on the sensitivity of different attributes. Therefore,
there is another type of attribute that contains both QI values and sensitive
values, namely, semi-sensitive attribute. Based on such observation, we propose
a new anonymization technique, called local generalization and bucketization,
to prevent identity disclosure and protect the sensitive values on each
semi-sensitive attribute and sensitive attribute. The rationale is to use local
generalization and local bucketization to divide the tuples into local
equivalence groups and partition the sensitive values into local buckets,
respectively. The protections of local generalization and local bucketization
are independent, so that they can be implemented by appropriate algorithms
without weakening other protection, respectively. Besides, the protection of
local bucketization for each semi-sensitive attribute and sensitive attribute
is also independent. Consequently, local bucketization can comply with various
principles in different attributes according to the actual requirements of
anonymization. The conducted extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach.
