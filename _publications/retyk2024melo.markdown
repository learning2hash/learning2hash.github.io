We present the Multilingual Entity Linking of Occupations (MELO) Benchmark, a
new collection of 48 datasets for evaluating the linking of entity mentions in
21 languages to the ESCO Occupations multilingual taxonomy. MELO was built
using high-quality, pre-existent human annotations. We conduct experiments with
simple lexical models and general-purpose sentence encoders, evaluated as
bi-encoders in a zero-shot setup, to establish baselines for future research.
The datasets and source code for standardized evaluation are publicly available
