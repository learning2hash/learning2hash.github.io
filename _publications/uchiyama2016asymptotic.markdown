We study asymptotic behavior, for large time \(n\), of the transition
probability of a two-dimensional random walk killed when entering into a
non-empty finite subset \(A\). We show that it behaves like \(4 \tilde u_A(x)
\tilde u_\{-A\}(-y) (\lg n)^\{-2\} p^n(y- x)\) for large \(n\), uniformly in the
parabolic regime \(|x|\vee |y| =O(\sqrt n)\), where \(p^n(y-x)\) is the transition
kernel of the random walk (without killing) and \(\tilde u_A\) is the unique
harmonic function in the 'exterior of \(A\)' satisfying the boundary condition
\(\tilde u_A(x) \sim \lg |x|\) at infinity.
