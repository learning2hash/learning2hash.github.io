The main contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of new or
improved approximation algorithms and data structures for several similarity
search problems. We examine the furthest neighbor query, the annulus query,
distance sensitive membership, nearest neighbor preserving embeddings and set
similarity queries in the large-scale, high-dimensional setting.
