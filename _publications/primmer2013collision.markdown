<p>Centera uses cryptographic hash functions as a means of addressing
stored objects, thus creating a new class of data storage referred to as
CAS (content addressed storage). Such hashing serves the useful function
of providing a means of uniquely identifying data and providing a global
handle to that data, referred to as the Content Address or CA. However,
such a model begs the question: how certain can one be that a given CA
is indeed unique? In this paper we describe fundamental concepts of
cryptographic hash functions, such as collision resistance, pre-image
resistance, and second-preimage resistance. We then map these properties
to the MD5 and SHA-256 hash algorithms, which are used to generate the
Centera content address. Finally, we present a proof of the collision
resistance of the Centera Content Address.</p>
