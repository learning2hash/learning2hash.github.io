Recently hashing is widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for its storage and computational efficiency. Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity45;preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre45;trained model as the guiding information i.e. treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre45;trained model many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover few of the methods consider the robustness of models which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper we propose a new method named 123;textbf123;C125;125;omprehensive s123;textbf123;I125;125;milarity 123;textbf123;M125;125;ining and c123;textbf123;O125;125;nsistency lear123;textbf123;N125;125;ing (CIMON). First we use global refinement and similarity statistical distribution to obtain reliable and smooth guidance. Second both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb45;invariant and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms a wide range of state45;of45;the45;art methods in both retrieval performance and robustness.
