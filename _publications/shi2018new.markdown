The dodecacode is a nonlinear additive quaternary code of length \\(12\\). By
puncturing it at any of the twelve coordinates, we obtain a uniformly packed
code of distance \\(5\\). In particular, this latter code is completely regular but
not completely transitive. Its coset graph is distance-regular of diameter
three on \\(2^\{10\}\\) vertices, with new intersection array \\(\\{33,30,15;1,2,15\\}\\).
The automorphism groups of the code, and of the graph, are determined.
Connecting the vertices at distance two gives a strongly regular graph of
(previously known) parameters \\((2^\{10\},495,238,240)\\). Another strongly regular
graph with the same parameters is constructed on the codewords of the dual
code. A non trivial completely regular binary code of length \\(33\\) is
constructed.
