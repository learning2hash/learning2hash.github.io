Buildings are a central feature of human culture and are increasingly being
analyzed with computational methods. However, recent works on computational
building understanding have largely focused on natural imagery of buildings,
neglecting the fundamental element defining a building's structure -- its
floorplan. Conversely, existing works on floorplan understanding are extremely
limited in scope, often focusing on floorplans of a single semantic category
and region (e.g. floorplans of apartments from a single country). In this work,
we introduce WAFFLE, a novel multimodal floorplan understanding dataset of
nearly 20K floorplan images and metadata curated from Internet data spanning
diverse building types, locations, and data formats. By using a large language
model and multimodal foundation models, we curate and extract semantic
information from these images and their accompanying noisy metadata. We show
that WAFFLE enables progress on new building understanding tasks, both
discriminative and generative, which were not feasible using prior datasets. We
will publicly release WAFFLE along with our code and trained models, providing
the research community with a new foundation for learning the semantics of
buildings.
