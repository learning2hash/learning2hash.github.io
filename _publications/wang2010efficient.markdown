The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) join is an expensive but important operation in
many data mining algorithms. Several recent applications need to perform KNN
join for high dimensional sparse data. Unfortunately, all existing KNN join
algorithms are designed for low dimensional data. To fulfill this void, we
investigate the KNN join problem for high dimensional sparse data.
  In this paper, we propose three KNN join algorithms: a brute force (BF)
algorithm, an inverted index-based(IIB) algorithm and an improved inverted
index-based(IIIB) algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithms for high dimensional sparse data.
