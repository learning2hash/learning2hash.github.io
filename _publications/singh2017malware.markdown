Malwares are becoming persistent by creating full- edged variants of the same
or different family. Malwares belonging to same family share same
characteristics in their functionality of spreading infections into the victim
computer. These similar characteristics among malware families can be taken as
a measure for creating a solution that can help in the detection of the malware
belonging to particular family. In our approach we have taken the advantage of
detecting these malware families by creating the database of these
characteristics in the form of n-grams of API sequences. We use various
similarity score methods and also extract multiple API sequences to analyze
malware effectively.
