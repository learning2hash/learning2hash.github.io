Consider \(n\) \(d\)-dimensional vectors with iid entries from a lattice
distribution \(X\). We show that the probability that all distances between them
are equal is asymptotically \[ C_n\cdot\frac\{1\}\{d^\{(m-1)/2\}\} \quad \text\{for\}
\quad d \to \infty \quad \text\{and\} \quad m = \binom\{n\}\{2\}, \] with an explicit
constant in terms of the first 4 moments of \(X\). Moreover, we generalise this
result to encompass all finitely supported \(X\), as well as under different
distances. Our method relies on the relatively rarely used multidimensional
local limit theorem and an analysis of the lattice on
\(\mathbb\{Z\}^\{\binom\{n\}\{2\}\}\) spanned by the image of the *overlapping* map
\[ H : \\{0,1\\}^n \to \\{0,1\\}^\{\binom\{n\}\{2\}\}, \quad (v_1, \dots, v_n) \mapsto
\Bigl( \mathbf\{1\}_\{\\{v_i \neq v_j\\}\} \Bigr)_\{1 \le i < j \le n\}. \]
