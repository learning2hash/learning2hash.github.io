This study evaluates the performance of TF-IDF weighting, averaged Word2Vec
embeddings, and BERT embeddings for document similarity scoring across two
contrasting textual domains. By analysing cosine similarity scores, the
methods' strengths and limitations are highlighted. The findings underscore
TF-IDF's reliance on lexical overlap and Word2Vec's superior semantic
generalisation, particularly in cross-domain comparisons. BERT demonstrates
lower performance in challenging domains, likely due to insufficient
domainspecific fine-tuning.
