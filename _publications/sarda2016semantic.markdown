Urban environments develop complex, non-obvious structures that are often
hard to represent in the form of maps or guides. Finding the right place to go
often requires intimate familiarity with the location in question and cannot
easily be deduced by visitors. In this work, we exploit large-scale samples of
usage information, in the form of mobile phone traces and geo-tagged Twitter
messages in order to automatically explore and annotate city maps via kernel
density estimation. Our experiments are based on one year's worth of mobile
phone activity collected by Nokia's Mobile Data Challenge (MDC). We show that
usage information can be a strong predictor of semantic place categories,
allowing us to automatically annotate maps based on the behavior of the local
user base.
