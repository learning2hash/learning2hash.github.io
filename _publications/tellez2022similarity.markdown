This manuscript introduces an autotuned algorithm for searching nearest
neighbors based on neighbor graphs and optimization metaheuristics to produce
Pareto-optimal searches for quality and search speed automatically; the same
strategy is also used to produce indexes that achieve a minimum quality. Our
approach is described and benchmarked with other state-of-the-art similarity
search methods, showing convenience and competitiveness.
