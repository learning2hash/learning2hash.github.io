The increase in the rate of data is much higher than the increase in the
speed of computers, which results in a heavy emphasis on search algorithms in
research literature. Searching an item in ordered list is an efficient
operation in data processing. Binary and interpolation search algorithms
commonly are used for searching ordered dataset in many applications. In this
paper, we present a hybrid algorithm to search ordered datasets based on the
idea of interpolation and binary search. The proposed algorithm called Hybrid
Search (HS), which is designed to work efficiently on unknown distributed
ordered datasets, experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm has
better performance when compared with other algorithms that use a similar
approach.
