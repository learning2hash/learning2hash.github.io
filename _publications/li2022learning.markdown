In this paper, we propose a new dense retrieval model which learns diverse
document representations with deep query interactions. Our model encodes each
document with a set of generated pseudo-queries to get query-informed,
multi-view document representations. It not only enjoys high inference
efficiency like the vanilla dual-encoder models, but also enables deep
query-document interactions in document encoding and provides multi-faceted
representations to better match different queries. Experiments on several
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, out-performing
strong dual encoder baselines.The code is available at
