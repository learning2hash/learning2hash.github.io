This study reports on the semantic organization of English sensory
descriptors of the five basic senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell
in a large corpus of over 8,000 fiction books. We introduce a large-scale text
data-driven approach based on distributional-semantic word embeddings to
identify and extract these descriptors as well as analyze their mixing
interconnections in the resulting conceptual and sensory space. The findings
are relevant for research on concept acquisition and representation, as well as
for applications that can benefit from a better understanding of perceptual
spaces of sensory experiences, in fiction, in particular, and in language in
general.
