This work addresses the problem of learning compact yet discriminative patch
descriptors within a deep learning framework. We observe that features
extracted by convolutional layers in the pixel domain are largely complementary
to features extracted in a transformed domain. We propose a convolutional
network framework for learning binary patch descriptors where pixel domain
features are fused with features extracted from the transformed domain. In our
framework, while convolutional and transformed features are distinctly
extracted, they are fused and provided to a single classifier which thus
jointly operates on convolutional and transformed features. We experiment at
matching patches from three different datasets, showing that our feature fusion
approach outperforms multiple state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy,
rate, and complexity.
