The recent tremendous success of unsupervised word embeddings in a multitude
of applications raises the obvious question if similar methods could be derived
to improve embeddings (i.e. semantic representations) of word sequences as
well. We present a simple but efficient unsupervised objective to train
distributed representations of sentences. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised models on most benchmark tasks, highlighting the
robustness of the produced general-purpose sentence embeddings.
