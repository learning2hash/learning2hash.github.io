We survey some basic results on the Gromov-Prohorov distance between metric
measure spaces. (We do not claim any new results.)
  We give several different definitions and show the equivalence of them. We
also show that convergence in the Gromov-Prohorov distance is equivalent to
convergence in distribution of the array of distances between finite sets of
random points.
