Digital archiving is becoming widespread owing to its effectiveness in
protecting valuable books and providing knowledge to many people
electronically. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage digital
archives for machine learning. If we can fully utilize such digitized data,
machine learning has the potential to uncover unknown insights and ultimately
acquire knowledge autonomously, just like humans read books. As a first step,
we design a dataset construction pipeline comprising an optical character
reader (OCR), an object detector, and a layout analyzer for the autonomous
extraction of image-text pairs. In our experiments, we apply our pipeline on
old photo books to construct an image-text pair dataset, showing its
effectiveness in image-text retrieval and insight extraction.
