We present a simple cross-lingual plagiarism detection method applicable to a
large number of languages. The presented approach leverages open multilingual
thesauri for candidate retrieval task and pre-trained multilingual BERT-based
language models for detailed analysis. The method does not rely on machine
translation and word sense disambiguation when in use, and therefore is
suitable for a large number of languages, including under-resourced languages.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for several existing
and new benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results for French, Russian, and
Armenian languages.
