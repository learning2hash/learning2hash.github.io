In this paper, a new data structure named group-list is proposed. The
group-list is as simple as the inverted index. However, the group-list divides
document identifiers in an inverted index into groups, which makes it more
efficient when it is used to perform the intersection or union operation on
document identifiers. The experimental results on a synthetic dataset show that
the group-list outperforms the inverted index.
