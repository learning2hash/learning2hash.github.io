Laws of large numbers, starting from certain nonequilibrium measures, have
been shown for the integrated current across a bond, and a tagged particle in
one-dimensional symmetric nearest-neighbor simple exclusion [Ann. Inst. Henri
Poincare Probab. Stat. 42 (2006) 567-577]. In this article, we prove
corresponding large deviation principles and evaluate the rate functions,
showing different growth behaviors near and far from their zeroes which connect
with results in [J. Stat. Phys. 136 (2009) 1-15].
