Classification in the dissimilarity space has become a very active research
area since it provides a possibility to learn from data given in the form of
pairwise non-metric dissimilarities, which otherwise would be difficult to cope
with. The selection of prototypes is a key step for the further creation of the
space. However, despite previous efforts to find good prototypes, how to select
the best representation set remains an open issue. In this paper we proposed
scalable methods to select the set of prototypes out of very large datasets.
The methods are based on genetic algorithms, dissimilarity-based hashing, and
two different unsupervised and supervised scalable criteria. The unsupervised
criterion is based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph created by the
prototypes as nodes and the dissimilarities as edges. The supervised criterion
is based on counting matching labels of objects and their closest prototypes.
The suitability of these type of algorithms is analyzed for the specific case
of dissimilarity representations. The experimental results showed that the
methods select good prototypes taking advantage of the large datasets, and they
do so at low runtimes.
