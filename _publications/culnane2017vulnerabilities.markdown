In the course of a survey of privacy-preserving record linkage, we reviewed
the approach taken by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) as described
in their series of reports "Beyond 2011". Our review identifies a number of
matters of concern. Some of the issues discovered are sufficiently severe to
present a risk to privacy.
