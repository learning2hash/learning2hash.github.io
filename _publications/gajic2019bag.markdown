Training a Siamese architecture for re-identification with a large number of
identities is a challenging task due to the difficulty of finding relevant
negative samples efficiently. In this work we present Bag of Negatives (BoN), a
method for accelerated and improved training of Siamese networks that scales
well on datasets with a very large number of identities. BoN is an efficient
and loss-independent method, able to select a bag of high quality negatives,
based on a novel online hashing strategy.
