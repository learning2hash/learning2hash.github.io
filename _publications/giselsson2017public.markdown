A database of images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12
species at several growth stages is made publicly available. It comprises
annotated RGB images with a physical resolution of roughly 10 pixels per mm. To
standardise the evaluation of classification results obtained with the
database, a benchmark based on \(f_\{1\}\) scores is proposed. The dataset is
available at https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset
