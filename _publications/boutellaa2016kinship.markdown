Automatic kinship verification using facial images is a relatively new and
challenging research problem in computer vision. It consists in automatically
predicting whether two persons have a biological kin relation by examining
their facial attributes. While most of the existing works extract shallow
handcrafted features from still face images, we approach this problem from
spatio-temporal point of view and explore the use of both shallow texture
features and deep features for characterizing faces. Promising results,
especially those of deep features, are obtained on the benchmark UvA-NEMO Smile
database. Our extensive experiments also show the superiority of using videos
over still images, hence pointing out the important role of facial dynamics in
kinship verification. Furthermore, the fusion of the two types of features
(i.e. shallow spatio-temporal texture features and deep features) shows
significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.
