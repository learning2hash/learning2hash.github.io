Retrieval of text information from natural scene images and video frames is a
challenging task due to its inherent problems like complex character shapes,
low resolution, background noise, etc. Available OCR systems often fail to
retrieve such information in scene/video frames. Keyword spotting, an
alternative way to retrieve information, performs efficient text searching in
such scenarios. However, current word spotting techniques in scene/video images
are script-specific and they are mainly developed for Latin script. This paper
presents a novel word spotting framework using dynamic shape coding for text
retrieval in natural scene image and video frames. The framework is designed to
search query keyword from multiple scripts with the help of on-the-fly
script-wise keyword generation for the corresponding script. We have used a
two-stage word spotting approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect the
translated keyword in a given text line by identifying the script of the line.
A novel unsupervised dynamic shape coding based scheme has been used to group
similar shape characters to avoid confusion and to improve text alignment.
Next, the hypotheses locations are verified to improve retrieval performance.
To evaluate the proposed system for searching keyword from natural scene image
and video frames, we have considered two popular Indic scripts such as Bangla
(Bengali) and Devanagari along with English. Inspired by the zone-wise
recognition approach in Indic scripts[1], zone-wise text information has been
used to improve the traditional word spotting performance in Indic scripts. For
our experiment, a dataset consisting of images of different scenes and video
frames of English, Bangla and Devanagari scripts were considered. The results
obtained showed the effectiveness of our proposed word spotting approach.
