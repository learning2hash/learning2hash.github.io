Action recognition has become a hot topic in computer vision. However, the
main applications of computer vision in video processing have focused on
detection of relatively simple actions while complex events such as violence
detection have been comparatively less investigated. This study focuses on the
benchmarking of various deep learning techniques on a complex dataset. Next, a
larger dataset is utilized to test the uplift from increasing volume of data.
The dataset size increase from 500 to 1,600 videos resulted in a notable
average accuracy improvement of 6% across four models.
