Anomaly detection is a challenging task and usually formulated as an
one-class learning problem for the unexpectedness of anomalies. This paper
proposes a simple yet powerful approach to this issue, which is implemented in
the student-teacher framework for its advantages but substantially extends it
in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Given a strong model pre-trained on
image classification as the teacher, we distill the knowledge into a single
student network with the identical architecture to learn the distribution of
anomaly-free images and this one-step transfer preserves the crucial clues as
much as possible. Moreover, we integrate the multi-scale feature matching
strategy into the framework, and this hierarchical feature matching enables the
student network to receive a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature
pyramid under better supervision, thus allowing to detect anomalies of various
sizes. The difference between feature pyramids generated by the two networks
serves as a scoring function indicating the probability of anomaly occurring.
Due to such operations, our approach achieves accurate and fast pixel-level
anomaly detection. Very competitive results are delivered on the MVTec anomaly
detection dataset, superior to the state of the art ones.
