We present a preliminary study of a knowledge graph created from season one
of the television show Veronica Mars, which follows the eponymous young private
investigator as she attempts to solve the murder of her best friend Lilly Kane.
We discuss various techniques for mining the knowledge graph for clues and
potential suspects. We also discuss best practice for collaboratively
constructing knowledge graphs from television shows.
