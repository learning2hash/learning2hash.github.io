Establishing visual correspondences under large intra-class variations
requires analyzing images at different levels, from features linked to
semantics and context to local patterns, while being invariant to
instance-specific details. To tackle these challenges, we represent images by
"hyperpixels" that leverage a small number of relevant features selected among
early to late layers of a convolutional neural network. Taking advantage of the
condensed features of hyperpixels, we develop an effective real-time matching
algorithm based on Hough geometric voting. The proposed method, hyperpixel
flow, sets a new state of the art on three standard benchmarks as well as a new
dataset, SPair-71k, which contains a significantly larger number of image pairs
than existing datasets, with more accurate and richer annotations for in-depth
analysis.
