Low rank representation (LRR) has recently attracted great interest due to
its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional subspace structures embedded
in data. One of its successful applications is subspace clustering which means
data are clustered according to the subspaces they belong to. In this paper, at
a higher level, we intend to cluster subspaces into classes of subspaces. This
is naturally described as a clustering problem on Grassmann manifold. The
novelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space onto an LRR model
on Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized framework. The new methods have
many applications in computer vision tasks. Several clustering experiments are
conducted on handwritten digit images, dynamic textures, human face clips and
traffic scene sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed
methods outperform a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.
