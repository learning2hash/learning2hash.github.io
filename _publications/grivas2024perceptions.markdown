The communities that we live in affect our health in ways that are complex
and hard to define. Moreover, our understanding of the place-based processes
affecting health and inequalities is limited. This undermines the development
of robust policy interventions to improve local health and well-being. News
media provides social and community information that may be useful in health
studies. Here we propose a methodology for characterising neighbourhoods by
using local news articles. More specifically, we show how we can use Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to unlock further information about neighbourhoods by
analysing, geoparsing and clustering news articles. Our work is novel because
we combine street-level geoparsing tailored to the locality with clustering of
full news articles, enabling a more detailed examination of neighbourhood
characteristics. We evaluate our outputs and show via a confluence of evidence,
both from a qualitative and a quantitative perspective, that the themes we
extract from news articles are sensible and reflect many characteristics of the
real world. This is significant because it allows us to better understand the
effects of neighbourhoods on health. Our findings on neighbourhood
characterisation using news data will support a new generation of place-based
research which examines a wider set of spatial processes and how they affect
health, enabling new epidemiological research.
