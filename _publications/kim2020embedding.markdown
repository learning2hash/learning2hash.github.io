We obtain a characterization on self-orthogonality for a given binary linear
code in terms of the number of column vectors in its generator matrix, which
extends the result of Bouyukliev et al. (2006). As an application, we give an
algorithmic method to embed a given binary \\(k\\)-dimensional linear code
\\(\mathcal\{C\}\\) (\\(k = 2,3,4\\)) into a self-orthogonal code of the shortest length
which has the same dimension \\(k\\) and minimum distance \\(d' \ge d(\mathcal\{C\})\\).
For \\(k > 4\\), we suggest a recursive method to embed a \\(k\\)-dimensional linear
code to a self-orthogonal code. We also give new explicit formulas for the
minimum distances of optimal self-orthogonal codes for any length \\(n\\) with
dimension 4 and any length \\(n \not\equiv 6,13,14,21,22,28,29 \pmod\{31\}\\) with
dimension 5. We determine the exact optimal minimum distances of \\([n,4]\\)
self-orthogonal codes which were left open by Li-Xu-Zhao (2008) when \\(n \equiv
0,3,4,5,10,11,12 \pmod\{15\}\\). Then, using MAGMA, we observe that our embedding
sends an optimal linear code to an optimal self-orthogonal code.
