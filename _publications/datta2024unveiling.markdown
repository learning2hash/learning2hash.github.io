In English literature, the 19th century witnessed a significant transition in
styles, themes, and genres. Consequently, the novels from this period display
remarkable diversity. This paper explores these variations by examining the
evolution of term usage in 19th century English novels through the lens of
information retrieval. By applying a query expansion-based approach to a
decade-segmented collection of fiction from the British Library, we examine how
related terms vary over time. Our analysis employs multiple standard metrics
including Kendall's tau, Jaccard similarity, and Jensen-Shannon divergence to
assess overlaps and shifts in expanded query term sets. Our results indicate a
significant degree of divergence in the related terms across decades as
selected by the query expansion technique, suggesting substantial linguistic
and conceptual changes throughout the 19th century novels.
