With the exponential growth in the usage of social media to share live
updates about life, taking pictures has become an unavoidable phenomenon.
Individuals unknowingly create a unique knowledge base with these images. The
food images, in particular, are of interest as they contain a plethora of
information. From the image metadata and using computer vision tools, we can
extract distinct insights for each user to build a personal profile. Using the
underlying connection between cuisines and their inherent tastes, we attempt to
develop such a profile for an individual based solely on the images of his
food. Our study provides insights about an individual's inclination towards
particular cuisines. Interpreting these insights can lead to the development of
a more precise recommendation system. Such a system would avoid the generic
approach in favor of a personalized recommendation system.
