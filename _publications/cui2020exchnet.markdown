Retrieving content relevant images from a large-scale fine grained dataset could suffer from intolerably slow query speed and highly
redundant storage cost, due to high-dimensional real-valued embeddings
which aim to distinguish subtle visual differences of fine-grained objects.
In this paper, we study the novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for fine-grained images, leveraging the search
and storage efficiency of hash learning to alleviate the aforementioned
problems. Specifically, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network,
termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints, it can firstly obtain both local and global features
to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects, respectively.
Furthermore, to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meaningâ€™s
consistency of these part-level features across images, we design a local
feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later, an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize
the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments, our proposal consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets,
which shows our effectiveness. Moreover, compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods, ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and
storage reduction, revealing its efficiency and practicality.
