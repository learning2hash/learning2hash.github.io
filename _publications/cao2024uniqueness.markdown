We prove the uniqueness of self-similar \(D_4\)-symmetric resistance forms on
unconstrained Sierpinski carpets (\(\mathcal\{USC\}\)'s). Moreover, on a sequence
of \(\mathcal\{USC\}\)'s \(K_n, n\geq 1\) converging in Hausdorff metric, we show
that the associated diffusion processes converge in distribution if and only if
the geodesic metrics on \(K_n, n\geq 1\) are equicontinuous with respect to the
Euclidean metric.
