Data is a critical resource for machine learning (ML), yet working with data
remains a key friction point. This paper introduces Croissant, a metadata
format for datasets that creates a shared representation across ML tools,
frameworks, and platforms. Croissant makes datasets more discoverable,
portable, and interoperable, thereby addressing significant challenges in ML
data management. Croissant is already supported by several popular dataset
repositories, spanning hundreds of thousands of datasets, enabling easy loading
into the most commonly-used ML frameworks, regardless of where the data is
stored. Our initial evaluation by human raters shows that Croissant metadata is
readable, understandable, complete, yet concise.
