In this work, we present Auto-captions on GIF, which is a new large-scale
pre-training dataset for generic video understanding. All video-sentence pairs
are created by automatically extracting and filtering video caption annotations
from billions of web pages. Auto-captions on GIF dataset can be utilized to
pre-train the generic feature representation or encoder-decoder structure for
video captioning, and other downstream tasks (e.g., sentence localization in
videos, video question answering, etc.) as well. We present a detailed analysis
of Auto-captions on GIF dataset in comparison to existing video-sentence
datasets. We also provide an evaluation of a Transformer-based encoder-decoder
structure for vision-language pre-training, which is further adapted to video
captioning downstream task and yields the compelling generalizability on
MSR-VTT. The dataset is available at
