Historical ciphered manuscripts are documents that were typically used in
sensitive communications within military and diplomatic contexts or among
members of secret societies. These secret messages were concealed by inventing
a method of writing employing symbols from diverse sources such as digits,
alchemy signs and Latin or Greek characters. When studying a new, unseen
cipher, the automatic search and grouping of ciphers with a similar alphabet
can aid the scholar in its transcription and cryptanalysis because it indicates
a probability that the underlying cipher is similar. In this study, we address
this need by proposing the CSI metric, a novel way of comparing pairs of
ciphered documents. We assess their effectiveness in an unsupervised clustering
scenario utilising visual features, including SIFT, pre-trained learnt
embeddings, and OCR descriptors.
