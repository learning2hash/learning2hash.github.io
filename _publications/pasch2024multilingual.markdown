This paper addresses the deduplication of multilingual textual data using
advanced NLP tools. We compare a two-step method involving translation to
English followed by embedding with mpnet, and a multilingual embedding model
(distiluse). The two-step approach achieved a higher F1 score (82% vs. 60%),
particularly with less widely used languages, which can be increased up to 89%
by leveraging expert rules based on domain knowledge. We also highlight
limitations related to token length constraints and computational efficiency.
Our methodology suggests improvements for future multilingual deduplication
tasks.
