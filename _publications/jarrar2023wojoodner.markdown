We present WojoodNER-2023, the first Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Shared Task. The primary focus of WojoodNER-2023 is on Arabic NER, offering
novel NER datasets (i.e., Wojood) and the definition of subtasks designed to
facilitate meaningful comparisons between different NER approaches.
WojoodNER-2023 encompassed two Subtasks: FlatNER and NestedNER. A total of 45
unique teams registered for this shared task, with 11 of them actively
participating in the test phase. Specifically, 11 teams participated in
FlatNER, while \(8\) teams tackled NestedNER. The winning teams achieved F1
scores of 91.96 and 93.73 in FlatNER and NestedNER, respectively.
