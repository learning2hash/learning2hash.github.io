Given a finite field F_q and a positive integer n, a flag is a sequence of
nested F_q-subspaces of a vector space F_q^n and a flag code is a nonempty
collection of flags. The projected codes of a flag code are the constant
dimension codes containing all the subspaces of prescribed dimensions that form
the flags in the flag code.
  In this paper we address the notion of equivalence for flag codes and explore
in which situations such an equivalence can be reduced to the equivalence of
the corresponding projected codes. In addition, this study leads to new results
concerning the automorphism group of certain families of flag codes, some of
them also introduced in this paper.
