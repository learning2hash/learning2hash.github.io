In this paper, we investigate whether robust hashing has a possibility to
robustly detect fake-images even when multiple manipulation techniques such as
JPEG compression are applied to images for the first time. In an experiment,
the proposed fake detection with robust hashing is demonstrated to outperform
state-of-the-art one under the use of various datasets including fake images
generated with GANs.
