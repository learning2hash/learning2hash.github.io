    In this paper, we investigate whether robust hashing has a possibility to robustly detect fake-images even when multiple manipulation techniques such as JPEG compression are applied to images for the first time. In an experiment, the proposed fake detection with robust hashing is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art one under the use of various datasets including fake images generated with GANs.
