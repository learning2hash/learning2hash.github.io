This paper introduces a new semantic search algorithm that uses Word2Vec and
Annoy Index to improve the efficiency of information retrieval from large
datasets. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional search
methods by offering enhanced speed, accuracy, and scalability. Testing on
datasets up to 100GB demonstrates the method's effectiveness in processing vast
amounts of data while maintaining high precision and performance.
