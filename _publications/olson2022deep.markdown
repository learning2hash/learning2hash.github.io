Artistic work leveraging Machine Learning techniques is an increasingly
popular endeavour for those with a creative lean. However, most work is done in
a single domain: text, images, music, etc. In this work, I design a system for
a machine learning created multimedia experience, specifically in the genre of
children's literature. We detail the process for exclusively using publicly
available pretrained deep neural network based models, I present multiple
examples of the work my system creates, and I explore the problems associated
in this area of creative work.
