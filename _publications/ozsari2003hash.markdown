In this paper, we present a general review of hash functions in a
cryptographic sense. We give special emphasis on some particular topics such as
cipher block chaining message authentication code (CBC MAC) and its variants.
This paper also broadens the information given in some well known surveys, by
including more details on block-cipher based hash functions and security of
different hash schemes.
