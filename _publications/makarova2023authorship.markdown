Do bilingual Russian-French authors of the end of the twentieth century such
as Andre\"i Makine, Val\'ery Afanassiev, Vladimir F\'edorovski, Iegor Gran,
Luba Jurgenson have common stylistic traits in the novels they wrote in French?
Can we distinguish between them and non-bilingual French writers' texts? Is the
phenomenon of interference observable in French texts of Russian authors? This
paper applies authorship attribution methods including Support Vector Machine
(SVM), \(K\)-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge classification, and Neural Network to
answer these questions.
