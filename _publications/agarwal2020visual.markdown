Understanding a scene by decoding the visual relationships depicted in an
image has been a long studied problem. While the recent advances in deep
learning and the usage of deep neural networks have achieved near human
accuracy on many tasks, there still exists a pretty big gap between human and
machine level performance when it comes to various visual relationship
detection tasks. Developing on earlier tasks like object recognition,
segmentation and captioning which focused on a relatively coarser image
understanding, newer tasks have been introduced recently to deal with a finer
level of image understanding. A Scene Graph is one such technique to better
represent a scene and the various relationships present in it. With its wide
number of applications in various tasks like Visual Question Answering,
Semantic Image Retrieval, Image Generation, among many others, it has proved to
be a useful tool for deeper and better visual relationship understanding. In
this paper, we present a detailed survey on the various techniques for scene
graph generation, their efficacy to represent visual relationships and how it
has been used to solve various downstream tasks. We also attempt to analyze the
various future directions in which the field might advance in the future. Being
one of the first papers to give a detailed survey on this topic, we also hope
to give a succinct introduction to scene graphs, and guide practitioners while
developing approaches for their applications.
