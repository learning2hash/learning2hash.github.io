On the trace of a discrete-time simple random walk on \(\mathbb\{Z\}^d\) for
\(d\geq 2\), we consider the evolution of favorite sites, i.e., sites that
achieve the maximal local time at a certain time. For \(d=2\), we show that
almost surely three favorite sites occur simultaneously infinitely often and
eventually there is no simultaneous occurrence of four favorite sites. For
\(d\geq 3\), we derive sharp asymptotics of the number of favorite sites. This
answers an open question of Erd\H\{o\}s and R\'\{e\}v\'\{e\}sz (1987), which was
brought up again in Dembo (2005).
