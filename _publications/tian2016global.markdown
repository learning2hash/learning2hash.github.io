Hashing methods have been widely investigated for fast approximate nearest
neighbor searching in large data sets. Most existing methods use binary vectors
in lower dimensional spaces to represent data points that are usually real
vectors of higher dimensionality. We divide the hashing process into two steps.
Data points are first embedded in a low-dimensional space, and the global
positioning system method is subsequently introduced but modified for binary
embedding. We devise dataindependent and data-dependent methods to distribute
the satellites at appropriate locations. Our methods are based on finding the
tradeoff between the information losses in these two steps. Experiments show
that our data-dependent method outperforms other methods in different-sized
data sets from 100k to 10M. By incorporating the orthogonality of the code
matrix, both our data-independent and data-dependent methods are particularly
impressive in experiments on longer bits.
