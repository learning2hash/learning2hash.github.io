Most eCommerce applications, like web-shops have millions of products. In
this context, the identification of similar products is a common sub-task,
which can be utilized in the implementation of recommendation systems, product
search engines and internal supply logistics. Providing this data set, our goal
is to boost the evaluation of machine learning methods for the prediction of
the category of the retail products from tuples of images and descriptions.
