Person detection from vehicles has made rapid progress recently with the
advent of multiple highquality datasets of urban and highway driving, yet no
large-scale benchmark is available for the same problem in off-road or
agricultural environments. Here we present the NREC Agricultural
Person-Detection Dataset to spur research in these environments. It consists of
labeled stereo video of people in orange and apple orchards taken from two
perception platforms (a tractor and a pickup truck), along with vehicle
position data from RTK GPS. We define a benchmark on part of the dataset that
combines a total of 76k labeled person images and 19k sampled person-free
images. The dataset highlights several key challenges of the domain, including
varying environment, substantial occlusion by vegetation, people in motion and
in non-standard poses, and people seen from a variety of distances; meta-data
are included to allow targeted evaluation of each of these effects. Finally, we
present baseline detection performance results for three leading approaches
from urban pedestrian detection and our own convolutional neural network
approach that benefits from the incorporation of additional image context. We
show that the success of existing approaches on urban data does not transfer
directly to this domain.
