In this work, we present a new dataset to advance the state-of-the-art in
fruit detection, segmentation, and counting in orchard environments. While
there has been significant recent interest in solving these problems, the lack
of a unified dataset has made it difficult to compare results. We hope to
enable direct comparisons by providing a large variety of high-resolution
images acquired in orchards, together with human annotations of the fruit on
trees. The fruits are labeled using polygonal masks for each object instance to
aid in precise object detection, localization, and segmentation. Additionally,
we provide data for patch-based counting of clustered fruits. Our dataset
contains over 41, 000 annotated object instances in 1000 images. We present a
detailed overview of the dataset together with baseline performance analysis
for bounding box detection, segmentation, and fruit counting as well as
representative results for yield estimation. We make this dataset publicly
available and host a CodaLab challenge to encourage comparison of results on a
common dataset. To download the data and learn more about MinneApple please see
