To improve software engineering, software repositories have been mined for
code snippets and bug fixes. Typically, this mining takes place at the level of
files or commits. To be able to dig deeper and to extract insights at a higher
resolution, we hereby present an annotated dataset that contains over 7 million
edits of code and text on Stack Overflow. Our preliminary study indicates that
these edits might be a treasure trove for mining information about fine-grained
patches, e.g., for the optimisation of non-functional properties.
