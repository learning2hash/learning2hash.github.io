Motivated by a recent work of Benoist and Quint and extending results from
the PhD thesis of the third author, we obtain limit theorems for products of
independent and identically distributed elements of GLd (R), such as the
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund strong law of large numbers, the CLT (with rates in
Wasserstein's distances) and almost sure invariance principles with rates.
