In this paper, we present a robust method for scene recognition, which
leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features and Sparse Coding
setting by creating a new representation of indoor scenes. Although CNNs highly
benefited the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, convolutional
layers adjust weights on a global-approach, which might lead to losing
important local details such as objects and small structures. Our proposed
scene representation relies on both: global features that mostly refers to
environment's structure, and local features that are sparsely combined to
capture characteristics of common objects of a given scene. This new
representation is based on fragments of the scene and leverages features
extracted by CNNs. The experimental evaluation shows that the resulting
representation outperforms previous scene recognition methods on Scene15 and
MIT67 datasets, and performs competitively on SUN397, while being highly robust
to perturbations in the input image such as noise and occlusion.
