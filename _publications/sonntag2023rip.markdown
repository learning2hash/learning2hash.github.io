Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming.
However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program
use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct
advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly,
execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the
complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a
challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark.
Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based
alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for
linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new
array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.
