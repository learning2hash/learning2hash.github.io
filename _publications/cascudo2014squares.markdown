Given a linear code \\(C\\), one can define the \\(d\\)-th power of \\(C\\) as the span
of all componentwise products of \\(d\\) elements of \\(C\\). A power of \\(C\\) may
quickly fill the whole space. Our purpose is to answer the following question:
does the square of a code "typically" fill the whole space? We give a positive
answer, for codes of dimension \\(k\\) and length roughly \\(\frac\{1\}\{2\}k^2\\) or
smaller. Moreover, the convergence speed is exponential if the difference
\\(k(k+1)/2-n\\) is at least linear in \\(k\\). The proof uses random coding and
combinatorial arguments, together with algebraic tools involving the precise
computation of the number of quadratic forms of a given rank, and the number of
their zeros.
