Motivated by DNA-based storage, we study the noisy shuffling channel, which
can be seen as the concatenation of a standard noisy channel (such as the BSC)
and a shuffling channel, which breaks the data block into small pieces and
shuffles them. This channel models a DNA storage system, by capturing two of
its key aspects: (1) the data is written onto many short DNA molecules that are
stored in an unordered way and (2) the molecules are corrupted by noise at
synthesis, sequencing, and during storage. For the BSC-shuffling channel we
characterize the capacity exactly (for a large set of parameters), and show
that a simple index-based coding scheme is optimal.
