Assessing similarity in source code has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its importance in software engineering tasks such as clone
detection and code search and recommendation. This work presents a comparative
analysis of unsupervised similarity measures for identifying source code clone
detection. The goal is to overview the current state-of-the-art techniques,
their strengths, and weaknesses. To do that, we compile the existing
unsupervised strategies and evaluate their performance on a benchmark dataset
to guide software engineers in selecting appropriate methods for their specific
use cases. The source code of this study is available at
