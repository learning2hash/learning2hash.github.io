Metric-based few-shot learning methods try to overcome the difficulty due to
the lack of training examples by learning embedding to make comparison easy. We
propose a novel algorithm to generate class representatives for few-shot
classification tasks. As a probabilistic model for learned features of inputs,
we consider a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions which is known to be
more expressive than Gaussian in a high dimensional space. Then, from a
discriminative classifier perspective, we get a better class representative
considering inter-class correlation which has not been addressed by
conventional few-shot learning algorithms. We apply our method to
*mini*ImageNet and *tiered*ImageNet datasets, and show that the
proposed approach outperforms other comparable methods in few-shot
classification tasks.
