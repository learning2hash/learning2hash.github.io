In this work, we propose a simple model that provides permutation invariant
maximally predictive prototype generator from a given dataset, which leads to
interpretability of the solution and concrete insights to the nature and the
solution of a problem. Our aim is to find out prototypes in the feature space
to map the collection of instances (i.e. bags) to a distance feature space and
simultaneously learn a linear classifier for multiple instance learning (MIL).
Our experiments on classical MIL benchmark datasets demonstrate that proposed
framework is an accurate and efficient classifier compared to the existing
approaches.
