This paper proposes a method of estimating micro-motion of an object at each
pixel that is too small to detect under a common setup of camera and
illumination. The method introduces an active-lighting approach to make the
motion visually detectable. The approach is based on speckle pattern, which is
produced by the mutual interference of laser light on object's surface and
continuously changes its appearance according to the out-of-plane motion of the
surface. In addition, speckle pattern becomes uncorrelated with large motion.
To compensate such micro- and large motion, the method estimates the motion
parameters up to scale at each pixel by nonlinear embedding of the speckle
pattern into low-dimensional space. The out-of-plane motion is calculated by
making the motion parameters spatially consistent across the image. In the
experiments, the proposed method is compared with other measuring devices to
prove the effectiveness of the method.
