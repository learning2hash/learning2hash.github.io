A random vector \\(X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)\\) with the \\(X_i\\) taking values in an
arbitrary measurable space \\((S, \mathscr\{S\})\\) is exchangeable if its law is the
same as that of \\((X_\{\sigma(1)\}, \ldots, X_\{\sigma(n)\})\\) for any permutation
\\(\sigma\\). We give an alternative and shorter proof of the representation result
(Jaynes \cite\{Jay86\} and Kerns and Sz\'ekely \cite\{KS06\}) stating that the law
of \\(X\\) is a mixture of product probability measures with respect to a signed
mixing measure. The result is "finitistic" in nature meaning that it is a
matter of linear algebra for finite \\(S\\). The passing from finite \\(S\\) to an
arbitrary one may pose some measure-theoretic difficulties which are avoided by
our proof. The mixing signed measure is not unique (examples are given), but we
pay more attention to the one constructed in the proof ("canonical mixing
measure") by pointing out some of its characteristics. The mixing measure is,
in general, defined on the space of probability measures on \\(S\\), but for
\\(S=\mathbb\{R\}\\), one can choose a mixing measure on \\(\mathbb\{R\}^n\\).
