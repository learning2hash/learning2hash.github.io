Wikidata is the largest general-interest knowledge base that is openly
available. It is collaboratively edited by thousands of volunteer editors and
has thus evolved considerably since its inception in 2012. In this paper, we
present Wikidated 1.0, a dataset of Wikidata's full revision history, which
encodes changes between Wikidata revisions as sets of deletions and additions
of RDF triples. To the best of our knowledge, it constitutes the first large
dataset of an evolving knowledge graph, a recently emerging research subject in
the Semantic Web community. We introduce the methodology for generating
Wikidated 1.0 from dumps of Wikidata, discuss its implementation and
limitations, and present statistical characteristics of the dataset.
