We propose in this paper a new, hybrid document embedding approach in order
to address the problem of document similarities with respect to the technical
content. To do so, we employ a state-of-the-art graph techniques to first
extract the keyphrases (composite keywords) of documents and, then, use them to
score the sentences. Using the ranked sentences, we propose two approaches to
embed documents and show their performances with respect to two baselines. With
domain expert annotations, we illustrate that the proposed methods can find
more relevant documents and outperform the baselines up to 27% in terms of
NDCG.
