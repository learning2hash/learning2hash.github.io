In this paper, we will present SketchQL, a video database management system
(VDBMS) for retrieving video moments with a sketch-based query interface. This
novel interface allows users to specify object trajectory events with simple
mouse drag-and-drop operations. Users can use trajectories of single objects as
building blocks to compose complex events. Using a pre-trained model that
encodes trajectory similarity, SketchQL achieves zero-shot video moments
retrieval by performing similarity searches over the video to identify clips
that are the most similar to the visual query. In this demonstration, we
introduce the graphic user interface of SketchQL and detail its functionalities
and interaction mechanisms. We also demonstrate the end-to-end usage of
SketchQL from query composition to video moments retrieval using real-world
scenarios.
