The aim of this paper is to prove the achievability of fixed-rate universal
coding problems by using our previously introduced notion of hash property.
These problems are the fixed-rate lossless universal source coding problem and
the fixed-rate universal channel coding problem. Since an ensemble of sparse
matrices satisfies the hash property requirement, it is proved that we can
construct universal codes by using sparse matrices.
