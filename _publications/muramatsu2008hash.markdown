The aim of this paper is to prove the achievability of several coding problems by using sparse matrices (the maximum column weight grows logarithmically in the block length) and maximal45;likelihood (ML) coding. These problems are the Slepian45;Wolf problem the Gelfand45;Pinsker problem the Wyner45;Ziv problem and the One45;helps45;one problem (source coding with partial side information at the decoder). To this end the notion of a hash property for an ensemble of functions is introduced and it is proved that an ensemble of q45;ary sparse matrices satisfies the hash property. Based on this property it is proved that the rate of codes using sparse matrices and maximal45;likelihood (ML) coding can achieve the optimal rate.
