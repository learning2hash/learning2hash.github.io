The aim of this paper is to prove the achievability of fixed-rate universal coding problems by using our previously introduced notion of hash property. These problems are the fixed-rate lossless universal source coding problem and the fixed-rate universal channel coding problem. Since an ensemble of sparse matrices satisfies the hash property requirement, it is proved that we can construct universal codes by using sparse matrices.
