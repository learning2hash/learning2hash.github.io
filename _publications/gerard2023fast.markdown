Though a lot of improvement has been made to hair rendering techniques in the
recent years, realistic rendering of hair remains a challenge, especially in
real time. In this paper, we propose a fast technique to approximate the
shading of hair lighted by an environment map, direct lighting or a global
illumination system, without having to render deep opacity maps or requiring
additional artistic work.
