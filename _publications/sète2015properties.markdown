The Faber--Walsh polynomials are a direct generalization of the (classical)
Faber polynomials from simply connected sets to sets with several simply
connected components. In this paper we derive new properties of the
Faber--Walsh polynomials, where we focus on results of interest in numerical
linear algebra, and on the relation between the Faber--Walsh polynomials and
the classical Faber and Chebyshev polynomials. Moreover, we present examples of
Faber--Walsh polynomials for two real intervals as well as some non-real sets
consisting of several simply connected components.
