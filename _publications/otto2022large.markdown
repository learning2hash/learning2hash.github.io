Consider a stationary Poisson process in a \\(d\\)-dimensional hyperbolic space.
For \\(R>0\\) define the point process \\(\xi_R^\{(k)\}\\) of exceedance heights over a
suitable threshold of the hyperbolic volumes of \\(k\\)th nearest neighbour balls
centred around the points of the Poisson process within a hyperbolic ball of
radius \\(R\\) centred at a fixed point. The point process \\(\xi_R^\{(k)\}\\) is
compared to an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the real line with intensity
function \\(e^\{-u\}\\) and point process convergence in the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
distance is shown. From this, a quantitative limit theorem for the hyperbolic
maximum \\(k\\)th nearest neighbour ball with a limiting Gumbel distribution is
derived.
