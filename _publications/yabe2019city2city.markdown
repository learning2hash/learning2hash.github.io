Large mobility datasets collected from various sources have allowed us to
observe, analyze, predict and solve a wide range of important urban challenges.
In particular, studies have generated place representations (or embeddings)
from mobility patterns in a similar manner to word embeddings to better
understand the functionality of different places within a city. However,
studies have been limited to generating such representations of cities in an
individual manner and has lacked an inter-city perspective, which has made it
difficult to transfer the insights gained from the place representations across
different cities. In this study, we attempt to bridge this research gap by
treating \textit\{cities\} and \textit\{languages\} analogously. We apply methods
developed for unsupervised machine language translation tasks to translate
place representations across different cities. Real world mobility data
collected from mobile phone users in 2 cities in Japan are used to test our
place representation translation methods. Translated place representations are
validated using landuse data, and results show that our methods were able to
accurately translate place representations from one city to another.
