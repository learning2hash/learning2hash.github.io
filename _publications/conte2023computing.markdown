Matching statistics were introduced to solve the approximate string matching
problem, which is a recurrent subroutine in bioinformatics applications. In
2010, Ohlebusch et al. [SPIRE 2010] proposed a time and space efficient
algorithm for computing matching statistics which relies on some components of
a compressed suffix tree - notably, the longest common prefix (LCP) array. In
this paper, we show how their algorithm can be generalized from strings to
Wheeler deterministic finite automata. Most importantly, we introduce a notion
of LCP array for Wheeler automata, thus establishing a first clear step towards
extending (compressed) suffix tree functionalities to labeled graphs.
