A MIDI based approach for music recognition is proposed and implemented in
this paper. Our Clarinet music retrieval system is designed to search piano
MIDI files with high recall and speed. We design a novel melody extraction
algorithm that improves recall results by more than 10%. We also implement 3
algorithms for retrieval-two self designed (RSA Note and RSA Time), and a
modified version of the Mongeau Sankoff Algorithm. Algorithms to achieve tempo
and scale invariance are also discussed in this paper. The paper also contains
detailed experimentation and benchmarks with four different metrics. Clarinet
achieves recall scores of more than 94%.
