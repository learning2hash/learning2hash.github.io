We propose a novel scene graph generation model called Graph R-CNN, that is
both effective and efficient at detecting objects and their relations in
images. Our model contains a Relation Proposal Network (RePN) that efficiently
deals with the quadratic number of potential relations between objects in an
image. We also propose an attentional Graph Convolutional Network (aGCN) that
effectively captures contextual information between objects and relations.
Finally, we introduce a new evaluation metric that is more holistic and
realistic than existing metrics. We report state-of-the-art performance on
scene graph generation as evaluated using both existing and our proposed
metrics.
