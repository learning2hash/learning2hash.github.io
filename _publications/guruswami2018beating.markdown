<p>We say a subset <span class="math inline">\(C \subseteq
\{1,2,\dots,k\}^n\)</span> is a <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-hash code (also called <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-separated) if for every subset of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> codewords from <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, there exists a coordinate where all
these codewords have distinct values. Understanding the largest possible
rate (in bits), defined as <span class="math inline">\((\log_2
|C|)/n\)</span>, of a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-hash code
is a classical problem. It arises in two equivalent contexts: (i) the
smallest size possible for a perfect hash family that maps a universe of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> elements into <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\dots,k\}\)</span>, and (ii) the zero-error
capacity for decoding with lists of size less than <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for a certain combinatorial channel. A
general upper bound of <span class="math inline">\(k!/k^{k-1}\)</span>
on the rate of a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-hash code (in
the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) was obtained
by Fredman and Koml'{o}s in 1984 for any <span class="math inline">\(k
\geq 4\)</span>. While better bounds have been obtained for <span
class="math inline">\(k=4\)</span>, their original bound has remained
the best known for each <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 5\)</span>. In
this work, we obtain the first improvement to the Fredman-Koml'{o}s
bound for every <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 5\)</span>. While we
get explicit (numerical) bounds for <span
class="math inline">\(k=5,6\)</span>, for larger <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> we only show that the FK bound can be
improved by a positive, but unspecified, amount. Under a conjecture on
the optimum value of a certain polynomial optimization problem over the
simplex, our methods allow an effective bound to be computed for every
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
