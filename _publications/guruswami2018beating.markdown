We say a subset \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C \subseteq \\{1,2,\dots,k\\}^n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-hash code (also called \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-separated) if for every subset of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} codewords from \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, there exists a coordinate where all these codewords have distinct values. Understanding the largest possible rate (in bits), defined as \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((\log\_2 |C|)/n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, of a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-hash code is a classical problem. It arises in two equivalent contexts: (i) the smallest size possible for a perfect hash family that maps a universe of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(N\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} elements into \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\{1,2,\dots,k\\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and (ii) the zero-error capacity for decoding with lists of size less than \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for a certain combinatorial channel. A general upper bound of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k!/k^\{k-1\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} on the rate of a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-hash code (in the limit of large \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}) was obtained by Fredman and Koml\'\{o\}s in 1984 for any $k \geq 4\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. While better bounds have been obtained for \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}k=4$, their original bound has remained the best known for each \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k \ge 5\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. In this work, we obtain the first improvement to the Fredman-Koml\'\{o\}s bound for every \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k \ge 5\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. While we get explicit (numerical) bounds for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k=5,6\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, for larger \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} we only show that the FK bound can be improved by a positive, but unspecified, amount. Under a conjecture on the optimum value of a certain polynomial optimization problem over the simplex, our methods allow an effective bound to be computed for every \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
