We say a subset \(C \subseteq \\{1,2,\dots,k\\&amp;\#123;1,2,\dots,k\\}^n\) is a \(k\)-hash code (also called \(k\)-separated) if for every subset of \(k\) codewords from \(C\), there exists a coordinate where all these codewords have distinct values. Understanding the largest possible rate (in bits), defined as \((\log_2 |C|)/n\), of a \(k\)-hash code is a classical problem. It arises in two equivalent contexts: (i) the smallest size possible for a perfect hash family that maps a universe of \(N\) elements into \(\\&amp;\#123;1,2,\dots,k\\{1,2,\dots,k\\&amp;\#125;\), and (ii) the zero-error capacity for decoding with lists of size less than \(k\) for a certain combinatorial channel. A general upper bound of \(k!/k^\&amp;\#123;k-1\&amp;\#125;\) on the rate of a \(k\)-hash code (in the limit of large \(n\)) was obtained by Fredman and Koml\'&amp;\#123;o&amp;\#125;s in 1984 for any $k \geq 4\(. While better bounds have been obtained for \)k=4$, their original bound has remained the best known for each \(k \ge 5\). In this work, we obtain the first improvement to the Fredman-Koml\'&amp;\#123;o&amp;\#125;s bound for every \(k \ge 5\). While we get explicit (numerical) bounds for \(k=5,6\), for larger \(k\) we only show that the FK bound can be improved by a positive, but unspecified, amount. Under a conjecture on the optimum value of a certain polynomial optimization problem over the simplex, our methods allow an effective bound to be computed for every \(k\).
