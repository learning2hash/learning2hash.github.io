Recent years have seen the exponential growth of heterogeneous multimedia data. The need for effective and accurate data retrieval from heterogeneous data sources has attracted much research interest in cross45;media retrieval. Here given a query of any media type cross45;media retrieval seeks to find relevant results of different media types from heterogeneous data sources. To facilitate large45;scale cross45;media retrieval we propose a novel unsupervised cross45;media hashing method. Our method incorporates local affinity and distance repulsion constraints into a matrix factorization framework. Correspondingly the proposed method learns hash functions that generates unified hash codes from different media types while ensuring intrinsic geometric structure of the data distribution is preserved. These hash codes empower the similarity between data of different media types to be evaluated directly. Experimental results on two large45;scale multimedia datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method where we outperform the state45;of45;the45;art methods.
