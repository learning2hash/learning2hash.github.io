Image retrieval is a complex task that differs according to the context and
the user requirements in any specific field, for example in a medical
environment. Search by text is often not possible or optimal and retrieval by
the visual content does not always succeed in modelling high-level concepts
that a user is looking for. Modern image retrieval techniques consist of
multiple steps and aim to retrieve information from large--scale datasets and
not only based on global image appearance but local features and if possible in
a connection between visual features and text or semantics. This paper presents
the Parallel Distributed Image Search Engine (ParaDISE), an image retrieval
system that combines visual search with text--based retrieval and that is
available as open source and free of charge. The main design concepts of
ParaDISE are flexibility, expandability, scalability and interoperability.
These concepts constitute the system, able to be used both in real-world
applications and as an image retrieval research platform. Apart from the
architecture and the implementation of the system, two use cases are described,
an application of ParaDISE in retrieval of images from the medical literature
and a visual feature evaluation for medical image retrieval. Future steps
include the creation of an open source community that will contribute and
expand this platform based on the existing parts.
