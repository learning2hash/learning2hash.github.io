We propose a new representation of the offsets of the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)
factorization based on the co-lexicographic order of the processed prefixes.
The selected offsets tend to approach the k-th order empirical entropy. Our
evaluations show that this choice of offsets is superior to the rightmost LZ
parsing and the bit-optimal LZ parsing on datasets with small high-order
entropy.
