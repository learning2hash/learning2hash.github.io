In this project we analysed how much semantic information images carry, and
how much value image data can add to sentiment analysis of the text associated
with the images. To better understand the contribution from images, we compared
models which only made use of image data, models which only made use of text
data, and models which combined both data types. We also analysed if this
approach could help sentiment classifiers generalize to unknown sentiments.
