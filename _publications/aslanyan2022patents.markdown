There are many general purpose benchmark datasets for Semantic Textual
Similarity but none of them are focused on technical concepts found in patents
and scientific publications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a
new human rated contextual phrase to phrase matching dataset. The entire
dataset contains close to \(50,000\) rated phrase pairs, each with a CPC
(Cooperative Patent Classification) class as a context. This paper describes
the dataset and some baseline models.
