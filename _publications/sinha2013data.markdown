Secret data hiding in binary images is more difficult than other formats since binary images require only one bit representation to indicate black and white. This study proposes a new method for data hiding in binary images using optimized bit position to replace a secret bit. This method manipulates blocks, which are sub-divided. The parity bit for a specified block decides whether to change or not, to embed a secret bit. By finding the best position to insert a secret bit for each divided block, the image quality of the resulting stego-image can be improved, while maintaining low computational complexity.The experimental results show that the proposed method has an improvement with respect to a previous work.
