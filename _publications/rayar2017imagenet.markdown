ImageNet is a large scale and publicly available image database. It currently
offers more than 14 millions of images, organised according to the WordNet
hierarchy. One of the main objective of the creators is to provide to the
research community a relevant database for visual recognition applications such
as object recognition, image classification or object localisation. However,
only a few visual descriptors of the images are available to be used by the
researchers. Only SIFT-based features have been extracted from a subset of the
collection. This technical report presents the extraction of some MPEG-7 visual
descriptors from the ImageNet database. These descriptors are made publicly
available in an effort towards open research.
