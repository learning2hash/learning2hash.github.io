The Gram spectrahedron \\(\text\{Gram\}(f)\\) of a form \\(f\\) with real coefficients
parametrizes the sum of squares decompositions of \\(f\\), modulo orthogonal
equivalence. For \\(f\\) a sufficiently general positive binary form of arbitrary
degree, we show that \\(\text\{Gram\}(f)\\) has extreme points of all ranks in the
Pataki range. This is the first example of a family of spectrahedra of
arbitrarily large dimensions with this property. We also calculate the
dimension of the set of rank \\(r\\) extreme points, for any \\(r\\). Moreover, we
determine the pairs of rank two extreme points for which the connecting line
segment is an edge of \\(\text\{Gram\}(f)\\).
