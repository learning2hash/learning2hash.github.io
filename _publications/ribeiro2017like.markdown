Hateful speech in Online Social Networks (OSNs) is a key challenge for
companies and governments, as it impacts users and advertisers, and as several
countries have strict legislation against the practice. This has motivated work
on detecting and characterizing the phenomenon in tweets, social media posts
and comments. However, these approaches face several shortcomings due to the
noisiness of OSN data, the sparsity of the phenomenon, and the subjectivity of
the definition of hate speech. This works presents a user-centric view of hate
speech, paving the way for better detection methods and understanding. We
collect a Twitter dataset of \\(100,386\\) users along with up to \\(200\\) tweets from
their timelines with a random-walk-based crawler on the retweet graph, and
select a subsample of \\(4,972\\) to be manually annotated as hateful or not
through crowdsourcing. We examine the difference between user activity
patterns, the content disseminated between hateful and normal users, and
network centrality measurements in the sampled graph. Our results show that
hateful users have more recent account creation dates, and more statuses, and
followees per day. Additionally, they favorite more tweets, tweet in shorter
intervals and are more central in the retweet network, contradicting the "lone
wolf" stereotype often associated with such behavior. Hateful users are more
negative, more profane, and use less words associated with topics such as hate,
terrorism, violence and anger. We also identify similarities between
hateful/normal users and their 1-neighborhood, suggesting strong homophily.
