Index coding and coded caching are two active research topics in information
theory with strong ties to each other. Motivated by the multi-access coded
caching problem, we study a new class of structured index coding problems
(ICPs) which are formed by the union of several symmetric ICPs. We derive upper
and lower bounds on the optimal server transmission rate for this class of ICPs
and demonstrate that they differ by at most a factor of two. Finally, we apply
these results to the multi-access coded caching problem to derive better bounds
than the state of the art.
