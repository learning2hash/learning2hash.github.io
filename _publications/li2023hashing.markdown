Unsupervised video hashing usually optimizes binary codes by learning to reconstruct input videos. Such reconstruction constraint spends much effort on frame45;level temporal context changes without focusing on video45;level global semantics that are more useful for retrieval. Hence we address this problem by decomposing video information into reconstruction45;dependent and semantic45;dependent information which disentangles the semantic extraction from reconstruction constraint. Specifically we first design a simple dual45;stream structure including a temporal layer and a hash layer. Then with the help of semantic similarity knowledge obtained from self45;supervision the hash layer learns to capture information for semantic retrieval while the temporal layer learns to capture the information for reconstruction. In this way the model naturally preserves the disentangled semantics into binary codes. Validated by comprehensive experiments our method consistently outperforms the state45;of45;the45;arts on three video benchmarks.
