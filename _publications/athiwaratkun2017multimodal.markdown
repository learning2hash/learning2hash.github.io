Word embeddings provide point representations of words containing useful
semantic information. We introduce multimodal word distributions formed from
Gaussian mixtures, for multiple word meanings, entailment, and rich uncertainty
information. To learn these distributions, we propose an energy-based
max-margin objective. We show that the resulting approach captures uniquely
expressive semantic information, and outperforms alternatives, such as word2vec
skip-grams, and Gaussian embeddings, on benchmark datasets such as word
similarity and entailment.
