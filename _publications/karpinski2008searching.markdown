We study a new variant of colored orthogonal range searching problem: given a
query rectangle \(Q\) all colors \(c\), such that at least a fraction \(\tau\) of all
points in \(Q\) are of color \(c\), must be reported. We describe several data
structures for that problem that use pseudo-linear space and answer queries in
poly-logarithmic time.
