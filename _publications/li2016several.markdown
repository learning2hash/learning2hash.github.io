Motivated by recent results on the constructions of permutation polynomials
with few terms over the finite field \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^n\}\), where \(n\) is a
positive even integer, we focus on the construction of permutation trinomials
over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^n\}\) from Niho exponents. As a consequence, several new
classes of permutation trinomials over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{2^n\}\) are constructed from
Niho exponents based on some subtle manipulation of solving equations with low
degrees over finite fields.
