This article proposes an artistic approach to increase and enrich the
understanding of Julia Sets. This approach includes the mathematical, the
playful, the artistic and the computational dimensions. It is argued that these
four dimensions are not disjointed or dissociated despite general rejection by
traditional academic communities and art critics communities. Also, some
significant collections of Computational Art or Computer-Generated Mathematical
Art are mentioned. Four artistic creations based on Julia Sets are presented as
examples using the CFDG language. Finally, an informal application of the
approach was carried out and artistic production of students are presented and
discussed.
