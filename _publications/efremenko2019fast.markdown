Research on nearest-neighbor methods tends to focus somewhat dichotomously
either on the statistical or the computational aspects -- either on, say, Bayes
consistency and rates of convergence or on techniques for speeding up the
proximity search. This paper aims at bridging these realms: to reap the
advantages of fast evaluation time while maintaining Bayes consistency, and
further without sacrificing too much in the risk decay rate. We combine the
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique with a novel missing-mass argument
to obtain a fast and Bayes-consistent classifier. Our algorithm's prediction
runtime compares favorably against state of the art approximate NN methods,
while maintaining Bayes-consistency and attaining rates comparable to minimax.
On samples of size \\(n\\) in \\(\R^d\\), our pre-processing phase has runtime \\(O(d n
log n)\\), while the evaluation phase has runtime \\(O(dlog n)\\) per query point.
