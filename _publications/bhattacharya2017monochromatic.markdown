Let \\(T(H, G_n)\\) be the number of monochromatic copies of a fixed connected
graph \\(H\\) in a uniformly random coloring of the vertices of the graph \\(G_n\\). In
this paper we give a complete characterization of the limiting distribution of
\\(T(H, G_n)\\), when \\(\\{G_n\\}_\{n \geq 1\}\\) is a converging sequence of dense
graphs. When the number of colors grows to infinity, depending on whether the
expected value remains bounded, \\(T(H, G_n)\\) either converges to a finite linear
combination of independent Poisson variables or a normal distribution. On the
other hand, when the number of colors is fixed, \\(T(H, G_n)\\) converges to a
(possibly infinite) linear combination of independent centered chi-squared
random variables. This generalizes the classical birthday problem, which
involves understanding the asymptotics of \\(T(K_s, K_n)\\), the number of
monochromatic \\(s\\)-cliques in a complete graph \\(K_n\\) (\\(s\\)-matching birthdays
among a group of \\(n\\) friends), to general monochromatic subgraphs in a network.
