Sparse representation-based classifiers have shown outstanding accuracy and
robustness in image classification tasks even with the presence of intense
noise and occlusion. However, it has been discovered that the performance
degrades significantly either when test image is not aligned with the
dictionary atoms or the dictionary atoms themselves are not aligned with each
other, in which cases the sparse linear representation assumption fails. In
this paper, having both training and test images misaligned, we introduce a
novel sparse coding framework that is able to efficiently adapt the dictionary
atoms to the test image via large displacement optical flow. In the proposed
algorithm, every dictionary atom is automatically aligned with the input image
and the sparse code is then recovered using the adapted dictionary atoms. A
corresponding supervised dictionary learning algorithm is also developed for
the proposed framework. Experimental results on digit datasets recognition
verify the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
