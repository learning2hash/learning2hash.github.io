We present shuffle coding, a general method for optimal compression of
sequences of unordered objects using bits-back coding. Data structures that can
be compressed using shuffle coding include multisets, graphs, hypergraphs, and
others. We release an implementation that can easily be adapted to different
data types and statistical models, and demonstrate that our implementation
achieves state-of-the-art compression rates on a range of graph datasets
including molecular data.
