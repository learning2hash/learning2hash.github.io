The secure hash function SHA-256 is a function on bit strings. This means that its restriction to the bit strings of any given length can be computed by a finite instruction sequence that contains only instructions to set and get the content of Boolean registers forward jump instructions and a termination instruction. We describe such instruction sequences for the restrictions to bit strings of the different possible lengths by means of uniform terms from an algebraic theory.
