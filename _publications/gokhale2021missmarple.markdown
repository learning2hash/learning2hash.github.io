In this paper we propose a novel socio-inspired convolutional neural network
(CNN) deep learning model for image splicing detection. Based on the premise
that learning from the detection of coarsely spliced image regions can improve
the detection of visually imperceptible finely spliced image forgeries, the
proposed model referred to as, MissMarple, is a twin CNN network involving
feature-transfer learning. Results obtained from training and testing the
proposed model using the benchmark datasets like Columbia splicing, WildWeb,
DSO1 and a proposed dataset titled AbhAS consisting of realistic splicing
forgeries revealed improvement in detection accuracy over the existing deep
learning models.
