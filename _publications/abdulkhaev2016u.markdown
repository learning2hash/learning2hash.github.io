In this study, we propose a simple yet very effective method for extracting
color information through binary feature description framework. Our method
expands the dimension of binary comparisons into RGB and YCbCr spaces, showing
more than 100% matching improve ment compared to non-color binary descriptors
for a wide range of hard-to-match cases. The proposed method is general and can
be applied to any binary descriptor to make it color sensitive. It is faster
than classical binary descriptors for RGB sampling due to the abandonment of
grayscale conversion and has almost identical complexity (insignificant
compared to smoothing operation) for YCbCr sampling.
