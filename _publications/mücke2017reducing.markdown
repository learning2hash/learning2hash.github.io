We study generalization properties of kernel regularized least squares
regression based on a partitioning approach. We show that optimal rates of
convergence are preserved if the number of local sets grows sufficiently slowly
with the sample size. Moreover, the partitioning approach can be efficiently
combined with local Nystr\"om subsampling, improving computational cost
twofold.
