As emojis are widely used in social media, people not only use an emoji to
express their emotions or mention things but also extend its usage to represent
complicate emotions, concepts or activities by combining multiple emojis. In
this work, we study how emoji combination, a consecutive emoji sequence, is
used like a new language. We propose a novel algorithm called Retrieval
Strategy to predict what emoji combination follows given a short text as
context. Our algorithm treats emoji combinations as phrase in language, ranking
sets of emoji combinations like retrieving words from dictionary. We show that
our algorithm largely improves the F1 score from 0.141 to 0.204 on emoji
combination prediction task.
