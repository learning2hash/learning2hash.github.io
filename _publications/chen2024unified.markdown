Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has therefore become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark MHaluBench meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework UNIHD which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.
