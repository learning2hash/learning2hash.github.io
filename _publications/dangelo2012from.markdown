Local Binary Descriptors are becoming more and more popular for image matching
tasks, especially when going mobile. While they are extensively studied in this
context, their ability to carry enough information in order to infer the
original image is seldom addressed. In this work, we leverage an inverse problem
approach to show that it is possible to directly reconstruct the image content
from Local Binary Descriptors. This process relies on very broad assumptions
besides the knowledge of the pattern of the descriptor at hand. This generalizes
previous results that required either a prior learning database or non-binarized
features. Furthermore, our reconstruction scheme reveals differences in the way
different Local Binary Descriptors capture and encode image information. Hence,
the potential applications of our work are multiple, ranging from privacy issues
caused by eavesdropping image keypoints streamed by mobile devices to the design
of better descriptors through the visualization and the analysis of their
geometric content.
