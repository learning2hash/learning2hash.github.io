Suffix trees are key and efficient data structure for solving string
problems. A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a
given text of length \(n\) with a linear construction cost. In this work, we
introduce an algorithm to build a linear index that allows finding a pattern of
any length under any internal node in a suffix tree in O(logn) time.
