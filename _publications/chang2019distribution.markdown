To learn the optimal similarity function between probe and gallery images in
Person re-identification, effective deep metric learning methods have been
extensively explored to obtain discriminative feature embedding. However,
existing metric loss like triplet loss and its variants always emphasize
pair-wise relations but ignore the distribution context in feature space,
leading to inconsistency and sub-optimal. In fact, the similarity of one pair
not only decides the match of this pair, but also has potential impacts on
other sample pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Distribution Context
Aware (DCA) loss based on triplet loss to combine both numerical similarity and
relation similarity in feature space for better clustering. Extensive
experiments on three benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and
MSMT17, evidence the favorable performance of our method against the
corresponding baseline and other state-of-the-art methods.
