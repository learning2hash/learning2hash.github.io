This paper introduces a novel dataset, called LCDMoire, which was created for
the first-ever image demoireing challenge that was part of the Advances in
Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop, held in conjunction with ICCV 2019. The
dataset comprises 10,200 synthetically generated image pairs (consisting of an
image degraded by moire and a clean ground truth image). In addition to
describing the dataset and its creation, this paper also reviews the challenge
tracks, competition, and results, the latter summarizing the current
state-of-the-art on this dataset.
