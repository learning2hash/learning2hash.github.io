Much of machine learning research focuses on producing models which perform
well on benchmark tasks, in turn improving our understanding of the challenges
associated with those tasks. From the perspective of ML researchers, the
content of the task itself is largely irrelevant, and thus there have
increasingly been calls for benchmark tasks to more heavily focus on problems
which are of social or cultural relevance. In this work, we introduce
Kuzushiji-MNIST, a dataset which focuses on Kuzushiji (cursive Japanese), as
well as two larger, more challenging datasets, Kuzushiji-49 and
Kuzushiji-Kanji. Through these datasets, we wish to engage the machine learning
community into the world of classical Japanese literature. Dataset available at
