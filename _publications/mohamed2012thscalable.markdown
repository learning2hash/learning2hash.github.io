In today's world of computers, dealing with huge amounts of data is not
unusual. The need to distribute this data in order to increase its availability
and increase the performance of accessing it is more urgent than ever. For
these reasons it is necessary to develop scalable distributed data structures.
In this paper we propose a TH* distributed variant of the Trie Hashing data
structure. First we propose Thsw new version of TH without node Nil in digital
tree (trie), then this version will be adapted to multicomputer environment.
The simulation results reveal that TH* is scalable in the sense that it grows
gracefully, one bucket at a time, to a large number of servers, also TH* offers
a good storage space utilization and high query efficiency special for ordering
operations.
