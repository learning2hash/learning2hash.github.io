Point clouds are a set of data points in space to represent the 3D geometry
of objects. A fundamental step in the processing is to identify a subset of
points to represent the shape. While traditional sampling methods often ignore
to incorporate geometrical information, recent developments in learning-based
sampling models have achieved significant levels of performance. With the
integration of geometrical priors, the ability to learn and preserve the
underlying structure can be enhanced when sampling. To shed light into the
shape, a qualitative skeleton serves as an effective descriptor to guide
sampling for both local and global geometries. In this paper, we introduce
MorphoSkel3D as a new technique based on morphology to facilitate an efficient
skeletonization of shapes. With its low computational cost, MorphoSkel3D is a
unique, rule-based algorithm to benchmark its quality and performance on two
large datasets, ModelNet and ShapeNet, under different sampling ratios. The
results show that training with MorphoSkel3D leads to an informed and more
accurate sampling in the practical application of object classification and
point cloud retrieval.
