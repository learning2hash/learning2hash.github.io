How to recommend outfits has gained considerable attention in both academia
and industry in recent years. Many studies have been carried out regarding
fashion compatibility learning, to determine whether the fashion items in an
outfit are compatible or not. These methods mainly focus on evaluating the
compatibility of existing outfits and rarely consider applying such knowledge
to 'design' new fashion items. We propose the new task of generating
complementary and compatible fashion items based on an arbitrary number of
given fashion items. In particular, given some fashion items that can make up
an outfit, the aim of this paper is to synthesize photo-realistic images of
other, complementary, fashion items that are compatible with the given ones. To
achieve this, we propose an outfit generation framework, referred to as
COutfitGAN, which includes a pyramid style extractor, an outfit generator, a
UNet-based real/fake discriminator, and a collocation discriminator. To train
and evaluate this framework, we collected a large-scale fashion outfit dataset
with over 200K outfits and 800K fashion items from the Internet. Extensive
experiments show that COutfitGAN outperforms other baselines in terms of
similarity, authenticity, and compatibility measurements.
