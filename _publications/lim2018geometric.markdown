We show how the Riemannian distance on \\(\mathbb\{S\}^n_\{++\}\\), the cone of
\\(n\times n\\) real symmetric or complex Hermitian positive definite matrices, may
be used to naturally define a distance between two such matrices of different
dimensions. Given that \\(\mathbb\{S\}^n_\{++\}\\) also parameterizes \\(n\\)-dimensional
ellipsoids, and inner products on \\(\mathbb\{R\}^n\\), \\(n \times n\\) covariance
matrices of nondegenerate probability distributions, this gives us a natural
way to define a geometric distance between a pair of such objects of different
dimensions.
