We consider the numerical evaluation of a class of double integrals with
respect to a pair of self-similar measures over a self-similar fractal set (the
attractor of an iterated function system), with a weakly singular integrand of
logarithmic or algebraic type. In a recent paper [Gibbs, Hewett and Moiola,
Numer. Alg., 2023] it was shown that when the fractal set is "disjoint" in a
certain sense (an example being the Cantor set), the self-similarity of the
measures, combined with the homogeneity properties of the integrand, can be
exploited to express the singular integral exactly in terms of regular
integrals, which can be readily approximated numerically. In this paper we
present a methodology for extending these results to cases where the fractal is
non-disjoint but non-overlapping (in the sense that the open set condition
holds). Our approach applies to many well-known examples including the
Sierpinski triangle, the Vicsek fractal, the Sierpinski carpet, and the Koch
snowflake.
