Visual media has always been the most enjoyed way of communication. From the
advent of television to the modern day hand held computers, we have witnessed
the exponential growth of images around us. Undoubtedly it's a fact that they
carry a lot of information in them which needs be utilized in an effective
manner. Hence intense need has been felt to efficiently index and store large
image collections for effective and on- demand retrieval. For this purpose low-
level features extracted from the image contents like color, texture and shape
has been used. Content based image retrieval systems employing these features
has proven very successful. Image retrieval has promising applications in
numerous fields and hence has motivated researchers all over the world. New and
improved ways to represent visual content are being developed each day.
Tremendous amount of research has been carried out in the last decade. In this
paper we will present a detailed overview of some of the powerful color, texture
and shape descriptors for content based image retrieval. A comparative analysis
will also be carried out for providing an insight into outstanding challenges in
this field.
