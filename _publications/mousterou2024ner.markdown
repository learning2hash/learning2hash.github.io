In this study, we address multiple challenges of developing a named-entity
recognition model in English for the fashion and luxury industry, namely the
entity disambiguation, French technical jargon in multiple sub-sectors,
scarcity of the ESG methodology, and a disparate company structures of the
sector with small and medium-sized luxury houses to large conglomerate
leveraging economy of scale.
  In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of 36+ entity types with a
luxury-oriented annotation scheme, and create a dataset of more than 40K
sentences respecting a clear hierarchical classification. We also present five
supervised fine-tuned models NER-Luxury for fashion, beauty, watches, jewelry,
fragrances, cosmetics, and overall luxury, focusing equally on the aesthetic
side and the quantitative side.
  In an additional experiment, we compare in a quantitative empirical
assessment of the NER performance of our models against the state-of-the-art
open-source large language models that show promising results and highlights
the benefits of incorporating a bespoke NER model in existing machine learning
pipelines.
