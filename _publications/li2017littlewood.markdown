We obtain the boundedness in \\(L^p\\) spaces for all \\(1<p<\infty\\) of the
so-called vertical Littlewood--Paley functions for non-local Dirichlet forms in
the metric measure space under some mild assumptions. For \\(1<p\le 2\\), the
pseudo-gradient is introduced to overcome the difficulty that chain rules are
not available for non-local operators, and then the Mosco convergence is used
to pave the way from the finite jumping kernel case to the general case, while
for \\(2\le p<\infty\\), the Burkholder--Davis--Gundy inequality is effectively
applied. The former method is analytic and the latter one is probabilistic. The
results extend those ones for pure jump symmetric L\'evy processes in Euclidean
spaces.
