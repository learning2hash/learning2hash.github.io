The paper presents RuBQ, the first Russian knowledge base question answering
(KBQA) dataset. The high-quality dataset consists of 1,500 Russian questions of
varying complexity, their English machine translations, SPARQL queries to
Wikidata, reference answers, as well as a Wikidata sample of triples containing
entities with Russian labels. The dataset creation started with a large
collection of question-answer pairs from online quizzes. The data underwent
automatic filtering, crowd-assisted entity linking, automatic generation of
SPARQL queries, and their subsequent in-house verification.
