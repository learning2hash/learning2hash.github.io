A collection of \(n\) random events is said to be \((n - 1)\)-wise independent if
any \(n - 1\) events among them are mutually independent. We characterise all
probability measures with respect to which \(n\) random events are \((n - 1)\)-wise
independent. We provide sharp upper and lower bounds on the probability that at
least \(k\) out of \(n\) events with given marginal probabilities occur over these
probability measures. The bounds are shown to be computable in polynomial time.
