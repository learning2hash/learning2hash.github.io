The probability that a random permutation in \\(S_n\\) is a derangement is well
known to be \\(\displaystyle\sum\limits_\{j=0\}^n (-1)^j \frac\{1\}\{j!\}\\). In this
paper, we consider the conditional probability that the \\((k+1)^\{st\}\\) point is
fixed, given there are no fixed points in the first \\(k\\) points. We prove that
when \\(n \neq 3\\) and \\(k \neq 1\\), this probability is a decreasing function of
both \\(k\\) and \\(n\\). Furthermore, it is proved that this conditional probability
is well approximated by \\(\frac\{1\}\{n\} - \frac\{k\}\{n^2(n-1)\}\\). Similar results are
also obtained about the more general conditional probability that the
\\((k+1)^\{st\}\\) point is fixed, given that there are exactly \\(d\\) fixed points in
the first \\(k\\) points.
