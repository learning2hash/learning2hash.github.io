The experimental landscape in natural language processing for social media is
too fragmented. Each year, new shared tasks and datasets are proposed, ranging
from classics like sentiment analysis to irony detection or emoji prediction.
Therefore, it is unclear what the current state of the art is, as there is no
standardized evaluation protocol, neither a strong set of baselines trained on
such domain-specific data. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework
(TweetEval) consisting of seven heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification
tasks. We also provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare
different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial experiments
show the effectiveness of starting off with existing pre-trained generic
language models, and continue training them on Twitter corpora.
