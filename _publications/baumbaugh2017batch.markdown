Batch codes, introduced by Ishai et al. encode a string \(x \in \Sigma^\{k\}\)
into an \(m\)-tuple of strings, called buckets. In this paper we consider
multiset batch codes wherein a set of \(t\)-users wish to access one bit of
information each from the original string. We introduce a concept of optimal
batch codes. We first show that binary Hamming codes are optimal batch codes.
The main body of this work provides batch properties of Reed-M\"uller codes. We
look at locality and availability properties of first order Reed-M\"uller codes
over any finite field. We then show that binary first order Reed-M\"uller codes
are optimal batch codes when the number of users is 4 and generalize our study
to the family of binary Reed-M\"uller codes which have order less than half
their length.
