<p>To examine the integrity and authenticity of an IP address
efficiently and economically, this paper proposes a new
non-Merkle-Damgard structural (non-MDS) hash function called JUNA that
is based on a multivariate permutation problem and an anomalous subset
product problem to which no subexponential time solutions are found so
far. JUNA includes an initialization algorithm and a compression
algorithm, and converts a short message of n bits which is regarded as
only one block into a digest of m bits, where 80 &lt;= m &lt;= 232 and
80 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 4096. The analysis and proof show that the new
hash is one-way, weakly collision-free, and strongly collision-free, and
its security against existent attacks such as birthday attack and
meet-in-the- middle attack is to O(2 ^ m). Moreover, a detailed proof
that the new hash function is resistant to the birthday attack is given.
Compared with the Chaum-Heijst-Pfitzmann hash based on a discrete
logarithm problem, the new hash is lightweight, and thus it opens a door
to convenience for utilization of lightweight digital signing
schemes.</p>
