Image similarity involves fetching similar looking images given a reference
image. Our solution called SimNet, is a deep siamese network which is trained
on pairs of positive and negative images using a novel online pair mining
strategy inspired by Curriculum learning. We also created a multi-scale CNN,
where the final image embedding is a joint representation of top as well as
lower layer embedding's. We go on to show that this multi-scale siamese network
is better at capturing fine grained image similarities than traditional CNN's.
