Remote sensing (RS) image retrieval is of great significant for geological
information mining. Over the past two decades, a large amount of research on
this task has been carried out, which mainly focuses on the following three
core issues: feature extraction, similarity metric and relevance feedback. Due
to the complexity and multiformity of ground objects in high-resolution remote
sensing (HRRS) images, there is still room for improvement in the current
retrieval approaches. In this paper, we analyze the three core issues of RS
image retrieval and provide a comprehensive review on existing methods.
Furthermore, for the goal to advance the state-of-the-art in HRRS image
retrieval, we focus on the feature extraction issue and delve how to use
powerful deep representations to address this task. We conduct systematic
investigation on evaluating correlative factors that may affect the performance
of deep features. By optimizing each factor, we acquire remarkable retrieval
results on publicly available HRRS datasets. Finally, we explain the
experimental phenomenon in detail and draw conclusions according to our
analysis. Our work can serve as a guiding role for the research of
content-based RS image retrieval.
