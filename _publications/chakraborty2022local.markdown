Local descriptors used in face recognition are robust in a sense that these
descriptors perform well in varying pose, illumination and lighting conditions.
Accuracy of these descriptors depends on the precision of mapping the
relationship that exists in the local neighborhood of a facial image into
microstructures. In this paper a local gradient hexa pattern (LGHP) is proposed
that identifies the relationship amongst the reference pixel and its
neighboring pixels at different distances across different derivative
directions. Discriminative information exists in the local neighborhood as well
as in different derivative directions. Proposed descriptor effectively
transforms these relationships into binary micropatterns discriminating
interclass facial images with optimal precision. Recognition and retrieval
performance of the proposed descriptor has been compared with state-of-the-art
descriptors namely LDP and LVP over the most challenging and benchmark facial
image databases, i.e. Cropped Extended Yale-B, CMU-PIE, color-FERET, and LFW.
The proposed descriptor has better recognition as well as retrieval rates
compared to state-of-the-art descriptors.
