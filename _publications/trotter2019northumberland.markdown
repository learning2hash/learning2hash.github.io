Methods for cetacean research include photo-identification (photo-id) and
passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) which generate thousands of images per
expedition that are currently hand categorised by researchers into the
individual dolphins sighted. With the vast amount of data obtained it is
crucially important to develop a system that is able to categorise this
quickly. The Northumberland Dolphin Dataset (NDD) is an on-going novel dataset
project made up of above and below water images of, and spectrograms of
whistles from, white-beaked dolphins. These are produced by photo-id and PAM
data collection methods applied off the coast of Northumberland, UK. This
dataset will aid in building cetacean identification models, reducing the
number of human-hours required to categorise images. Example use cases and
areas identified for speed up are examined.
