We aim at studying the asymptotic properties of typical positive braids,
respectively positive dual braids. Denoting by \(\mu_k\) the uniform distribution
on positive (dual) braids of length \(k\), we prove that the sequence \((\mu_k)_k\)
converges to a unique probability measure \(\mu_\{\infty\}\) on infinite positive
(dual) braids. The key point is that the limiting measure \(\mu_\{\infty\}\) has a
Markovian structure which can be described explicitly using the combinatorial
properties of braids encapsulated in the M\"obius polynomial. As a by-product,
we settle a conjecture by Gebhardt and Tawn (J. Algebra, 2014) on the shape of
the Garside normal form of large uniform braids.
