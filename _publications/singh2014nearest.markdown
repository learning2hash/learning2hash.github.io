Keyword-based search in text-rich multi-dimensional datasets facilitates many
novel applications and tools. In this paper, we consider objects that are tagged
with keywords and are embedded in a vector space. For these datasets, we study
queries that ask for the tightest groups of points satisfying a given set of
keywords. We propose a novel method called ProMiSH (Projection and Multi Scale
Hashing) that uses random projection and hash-based index structures, and
achieves high scalability and speedup. We present an exact and an approximate
version of the algorithm. Our empirical studies, both on real and synthetic
datasets, show that ProMiSH has a speedup of more than four orders over state-
of-the-art tree-based techniques. Our scalability tests on datasets of sizes up
to 10 million and dimensions up to 100 for queries having up to 9 keywords show
that ProMiSH scales linearly with the dataset size, the dataset dimension, the
query size, and the result size.
