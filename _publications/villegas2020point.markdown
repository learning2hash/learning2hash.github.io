Physical places help shape how we perceive the experiences we have there. For
the first time, we study the relationship between social media text and the
type of the place from where it was posted, whether a park, restaurant, or
someplace else. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel data set of
\(\sim\)200,000 English tweets published from 2,761 different points-of-interest
in the U.S., enriched with place type information. We train classifiers to
predict the type of the location a tweet was sent from that reach a macro F1 of
43.67 across eight classes and uncover the linguistic markers associated with
each type of place. The ability to predict semantic place information from a
tweet has applications in recommendation systems, personalization services and
cultural geography.
