One of the most terrifying phenomenon nowadays is the DeepFake: the
possibility to automatically replace a person's face in images and videos by
exploiting algorithms based on deep learning. This paper will present a brief
overview of technologies able to produce DeepFake images of faces. A forensics
analysis of those images with standard methods will be presented: not
surprisingly state of the art techniques are not completely able to detect the
fakeness. To solve this, a preliminary idea on how to fight DeepFake images of
faces will be presented by analysing anomalies in the frequency domain.
