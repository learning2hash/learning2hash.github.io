We propose Unified Visual-Semantic Embeddings (UniVSE) for learning a joint
space of visual and textual concepts. The space unifies the concepts at
different levels, including objects, attributes, relations, and full scenes. A
contrastive learning approach is proposed for the fine-grained alignment from
only image-caption pairs. Moreover, we present an effective approach for
enforcing the coverage of semantic components that appear in the sentence. We
demonstrate the robustness of Unified VSE in defending text-domain adversarial
attacks on cross-modal retrieval tasks. Such robustness also empowers the use
of visual cues to resolve word dependencies in novel sentences.
