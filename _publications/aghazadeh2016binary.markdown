We develop a scalable algorithm to learn binary hash codes for indexing large45;scale datasets. Near45;isometric binary hashing (NIBH) is a data45;dependent hashing scheme that quantizes the output of a learned low45;dimensional embedding to obtain a binary hash code. In contrast to conventional hashing schemes which typically rely on an ell95;245;norm (i.e. average distortion) minimization NIBH is based on a ell95;123;âˆž125;45;norm (i.e. worst45;case distortion) minimization that provides several benefits including superior distance ranking and near45;neighbor preservation performance. We develop a practical and efficient algorithm for NIBH based on column generation that scales well to large datasets. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of NIBH over ten state45;of45;the45;art binary hashing schemes.
