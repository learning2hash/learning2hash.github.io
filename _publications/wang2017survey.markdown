Nearest neighbor search is a problem of finding the data points from the database such that the distances from them to the
query point are the smallest. Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been widely studied recently. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of preserving
the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization,
and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity preserving as the objective function is very different
though quantization, as we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition, we present the evaluation
protocols, and the general performance analysis, and point out that the quantization algori
