Tamarian, a fictional language introduced in the Star Trek episode Darmok,
communicates meaning through utterances of metaphorical references, such as
"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" instead of "We should work together." This work
assembles a Tamarian-English dictionary of utterances from the original episode
and several follow-on novels, and uses this to construct a parallel corpus of
456 English-Tamarian utterances. A machine translation system based on a large
language model (T5) is trained using this parallel corpus, and is shown to
produce an accuracy of 76% when translating from English to Tamarian on known
utterances.
