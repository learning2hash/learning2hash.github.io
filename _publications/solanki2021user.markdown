With the prevalence of online social networking sites (OSNs) and mobile
devices, people are increasingly reliant on a variety of OSNs for keeping in
touch with family and friends, and using it as a source of information. For
example, a user might utilise multiple OSNs for different purposes, such as
using Flickr to share holiday pictures with family and friends, and Twitter to
post short messages about their thoughts. Identifying the same user across
multiple OSNs is an important task as this allows us to understand the usage
patterns of users among different OSNs, make recommendations when a user
registers for a new OSN, and various other useful applications. To address this
problem, we proposed an algorithm based on the multilayer perceptron using
various types of features, namely: (i) user profile, such as name, location,
description; (ii) temporal distribution of user generated content; and (iii)
embedding based on user name, real name and description. Using a Twitter and
Flickr dataset of users and their posting activities, we perform an empirical
study on how these features affect the performance of user identification
across the two OSNs and discuss our main findings based on the different
features.
