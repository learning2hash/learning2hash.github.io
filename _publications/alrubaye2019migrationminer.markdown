In this paper we introduce, MigrationMiner, an automated tool that detects
code migrations performed between Java third-party library. Given a list of
open source projects, the tool detects potential library migration code changes
and collects the specific code fragments in which the developer replaces
methods from the retired library with methods from the new library. To support
the migration process, MigrationMiner collects the library documentation that
is associated with every method involved in the migration. We evaluate our tool
on a benchmark of manually validated library migrations. Results show that
MigrationMiner achieves an accuracy of 100%. A demo video of MigrationMiner is
available at https://youtu.be/sAlR1HNetXc.
