In recent years, the distinctive advancement of handling huge data promotes the
evolution of ubiquitous computing and analysis technologies. With the constantly
upward system burden and computational complexity, adaptive coding has been a
fascinating topic for pattern analysis, with outstanding performance. In this
work, a continuous hashing method, termed continuous random hashing (CRH), is
proposed to encode sequential data stream, while ignorance of previously hashing
knowledge is possible. Instead, a random selection idea is adopted to adaptively
approximate the differential encoding patterns of data stream, e.g., streaming
media, and iteration is avoided for stepwise learning. Experimental results
demonstrate our method is able to provide outstanding performance, as a
benchmark approach to continuous hashing.
