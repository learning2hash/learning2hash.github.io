In this paper, we examine the linear codes with respect to the Hamming metric
from incidence matrices of the zero-divisor graphs with vertex set is the set
of all non-zero zero-divisors of the ring \(\mathbb\{Z\}_n\) and two distinct
vertices being adjacent iff their product is zero over \(\mathbb\{Z\}_n.\) The main
parameters of the codes are obtained.
