Fine-grained image classification (FGIC) is a challenging task in computer
vision for due to small visual differences among inter-subcategories, but,
large intra-class variations. Deep learning methods have achieved remarkable
success in solving FGIC. In this paper, we propose a fusion approach to address
FGIC by combining global texture with local patch-based information. The first
pipeline extracts deep features from various fixed-size non-overlapping patches
and encodes features by sequential modelling using the long short-term memory
(LSTM). Another path computes image-level textures at multiple scales using the
local binary patterns (LBP). The advantages of both streams are integrated to
represent an efficient feature vector for image classification. The method is
tested on eight datasets representing the human faces, skin lesions, food
dishes, marine lives, etc. using four standard backbone CNNs. Our method has
attained better classification accuracy over existing methods with notable
margins.
