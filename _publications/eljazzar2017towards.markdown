The number of Internet Muslim-users is remarkably increasing from all over
the world countries. There are a lot of structured, and well-documented text
resources for the Quran interpretation, Tafsir, over the Internet with several
languages. Nevertheless, when searching for the meaning of specific words, many
users prefer watching short videos rather than reading a script or a book. This
paper introduces the solution for the challenge of partitioning the common
Tafsir videos into short videos according to the search query and sharing these
result videos on the social networks. Furthermore, we provide the ability of
user commenting on a specific time-based frame on the video or a specific verse
in a particular subject. It would be very valuable to apply the current
technologies on Holy Quran and Tafsir to easy the query for verses,
understanding of its meaning, and sharing it on the different social media.
