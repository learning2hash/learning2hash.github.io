For \\(d\in\mathbb\{N\}\\), let \\(S\\) be a set of points in \\(\mathbb\{R\}^d\\) in general
position. A set \\(I\\) of \\(k\\) points from \\(S\\) is a \\(k\\)-island in \\(S\\) if the convex
hull \\(\mathrm\{conv\}(I)\\) of \\(I\\) satisfies \\(\mathrm\{conv\}(I) \cap S = I\\). A
\\(k\\)-island in \\(S\\) in convex position is a \\(k\\)-hole in \\(S\\).
  For \\(d,k\in\mathbb\{N\}\\) and a convex body \\(K\subseteq\mathbb\{R\}^d\\) of volume
\\(1\\), let \\(S\\) be a set of \\(n\\) points chosen uniformly and independently at
random from \\(K\\). We show that the expected number of \\(k\\)-holes in \\(S\\) is in
\\(O(n^d)\\). Our estimate improves and generalizes all previous bounds. In
particular, we estimate the expected number of empty simplices in \\(S\\) by
\\(2^\{d-1\}\cdot d!\cdot\binom\{n\}\{d\}\\). This is tight in the plane up to a
lower-order term.
  Our method gives an asymptotically tight upper bound \\(O(n^d)\\) even in the
much more general setting, where we estimate the expected number of \\(k\\)-islands
in \\(S\\).
