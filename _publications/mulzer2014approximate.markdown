Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} be a nonnegative integer. In the approximate \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-flat nearest neighbor (\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN) problem, we are given a set \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(P \subset \mathbb\{R\}^d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} points in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-dimensional space and a fixed approximation factor \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c > 1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Our goal is to preprocess \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(P\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} so that we can efficiently answer approximate \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-flat nearest neighbor queries: given a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-flat \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(F\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, find a point in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(P\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} whose distance to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(F\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is within a factor \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of the distance between \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(F\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and the closest point in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(P\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The case \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k = 0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} corresponds to the well-studied approximate nearest neighbor problem, for which a plethora of results are known, both in low and high dimensions. The case \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k = 1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is called approximate line nearest neighbor. In this case, we are aware of only one provably efficient data structure, due to Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, and Nguyen. For $k \geq 2$, we know of no previous results. We present the first efficient data structure that can handle approximate nearest neighbor queries for arbitrary \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We use a data structure for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN-queries as a black box, and the performance depends on the parameters of the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN solution: suppose we have an \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN structure with query time \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^\{\rho\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and space requirement \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^\{1+\sigma\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho, \sigma > 0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Then we can answer \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN queries in time \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^\{k/(k + 1 - \rho) + t\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and space \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^\{1+\sigma k/(k + 1 - \rho)\} + n\log^\{O(1/t)\} n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Here, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(t > 0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is an arbitrary constant and the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-notation hides exponential factors in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1/t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and polynomials in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Our new data structures also give an improvement in the space requirement over the previous result for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ANN: we can achieve near-linear space and sublinear query time, a further step towards practical applications where space constitutes the bottleneck.
