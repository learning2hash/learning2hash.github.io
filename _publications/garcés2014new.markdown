In this work, we propose a new similarity index for images considering the
entropy function and group theory. This index considers an algebraic group of
images, it is defined by an inner law that provides a novel approach for the
subtraction of images. Through an equivalence relationship in the field of
images, we prove the existence of the quotient group, on which the new
similarity index is defined. We also present the main properties of the new
index, and the immediate application thereof as a stopping criterion of the
"Mean Shift Iterative Algorithm".
