A recent work shows how we can optimize a tree based mode of operation for a
rate 1 hash function. In particular, an algorithm and a theorem are presented
for selecting a good tree topology in order to optimize both the running time
and the number of processors at each step of the computation. Because this
paper deals only with trees having their leaves at the same depth, the number
of saved computing resources is perfectly optimal only for this category of
trees. In this note, we address the more general case and describe a simple
algorithm which, starting from such a tree topology, reworks it to further
reduce the number of processors and the total amount of work done to hash a
message.
