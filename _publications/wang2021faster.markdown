\\(k\\)NN based neural machine translation (\\(k\\)NN-MT) has achieved
state-of-the-art results in a variety of MT tasks. One significant shortcoming
of \\(k\\)NN-MT lies in its inefficiency in identifying the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors
of the query representation from the entire datastore, which is prohibitively
time-intensive when the datastore size is large. In this work, we propose
\textbf\{Faster \\(k\\)NN-MT\} to address this issue. The core idea of Faster
\\(k\\)NN-MT is to use a hierarchical clustering strategy to approximate the
distance between the query and a data point in the datastore, which is
decomposed into two parts: the distance between the query and the center of the
cluster that the data point belongs to, and the distance between the data point
and the cluster center. We propose practical ways to compute these two parts in
a significantly faster manner. Through extensive experiments on different MT
benchmarks, we show that \textbf\{Faster \\(k\\)NN-MT\} is faster than Fast \\(k\\)NN-MT
\citep\{meng2021fast\} and only slightly (1.2 times) slower than its vanilla
counterpart while preserving model performance as \\(k\\)NN-MT. Faster \\(k\\)NN-MT
enables the deployment of \\(k\\)NN-MT models on real-world MT services.
