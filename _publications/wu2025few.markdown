Current fake image detectors trained on large synthetic image datasets perform satisfactorily on limited studied generative models. However, these detectors suffer a notable performance decline over unseen models. Besides, collecting adequate training data from online generative models is often expensive or infeasible. To overcome these issues, we propose Few-Shot Detector (FSD), a novel AI-generated image detector which learns a specialized metric space for effectively distinguishing unseen fake images using very few samples. Experiments show that FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance by \(+11.6%\) average accuracy on the GenImage dataset with only \(10\) additional samples. More importantly, our method is better capable of capturing the intra-category commonality in unseen images without further training.
