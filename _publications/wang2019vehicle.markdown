In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset for vehicle
re-identification (ReID), which contains 137k images of 13k vehicle instances
captured by UAV-mounted cameras. To our knowledge, it is the largest UAV-based
vehicle ReID dataset. To increase intra-class variation, each vehicle is
captured by at least two UAVs at different locations, with diverse view-angles
and flight-altitudes. We manually label a variety of vehicle attributes,
including vehicle type, color, skylight, bumper, spare tire and luggage rack.
Furthermore, for each vehicle image, the annotator is also required to mark the
discriminative parts that helps them to distinguish this particular vehicle
from others. Besides the dataset, we also design a specific vehicle ReID
algorithm to make full use of the rich annotation information. It is capable of
explicitly detecting discriminative parts for each specific vehicle and
significantly outperforms the evaluated baselines and state-of-the-art vehicle
ReID approaches.
