28,000+ high-quality iris images of 1350 distinct eyes from 650+ different
individuals from a relatively diverse university town population were
collected. A small defined unobstructed portion of the normalized iris image is
selected as a key portion for quickly identifying an unknown individual when
submitting an iris image to be matched to a database of enrolled irises of the
1350 distinct eyes. The intrinsic dimension of a set of these key portions of
the 1350 enrolled irises is measured to be about four (4). This set is mapped
to a four-dimensional intrinsic space by principal components analysis (PCA).
When an iris image is presented to the iris database for identification, the
search begins in the neighborhood of the location of its key portion in the 4D
intrinsic space, typically finding a correct identifying match after comparison
to only a few percent of the database.
