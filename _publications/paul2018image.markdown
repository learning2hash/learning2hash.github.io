NumtaDB is by far the largest data-set collection for handwritten digits in
Bengali. This is a diverse dataset containing more than 85000 images. But this
diversity also makes this dataset very difficult to work with. The goal of this
paper is to find the benchmark for pre-processed images which gives good
accuracy on any machine learning models. The reason being, there are no
available pre-processed data for Bengali digit recognition to work with like
the English digits for MNIST.
