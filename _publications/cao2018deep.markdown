Deep hashing enables image retrieval by end45;to45;end learning of deep representations and hash codes from training data with pairwise similarity information. Subject to the distribution skewness underlying the similarity information most existing deep hashing methods may underperform for imbalanced data due to misspecified loss functions. This paper presents Deep Priority Hashing (DPH) an end45;to45;end architecture that generates compact and balanced hash codes in a Bayesian learning framework. The main idea is to reshape the standard cross45;entropy loss for similarity45;preserving learning such that it down45;weighs the loss associated to highly45;confident pairs. This idea leads to a novel priority cross45;entropy loss which prioritizes the training on uncertain pairs over confident pairs. Also we propose another priority quantization loss which prioritizes hard45;to45;quantize examples for generation of nearly lossless hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPH can generate high45;quality hash codes and yield state45;of45;the45;art image retrieval results on three datasets ImageNet NUS45;WIDE and MS45;COCO.
