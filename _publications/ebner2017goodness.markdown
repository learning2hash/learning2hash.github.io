We propose a class of goodness-of-fit tests for complete spatial randomness
(CSR). In contrast to standard tests, our procedure utilizes a transformation
of the data to a binary image, which is then characterized by geometric
functionals. Under a suitable limiting regime, we derive the asymptotic
distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis and almost sure
limits under certain alternatives. The new tests are computationally efficient,
and simulations show that they are strong competitors to other tests of CSR.
The tests are applied to a real data set in gamma-ray astronomy, and immediate
extensions are presented to encourage further work.
