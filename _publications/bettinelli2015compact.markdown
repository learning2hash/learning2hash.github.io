We show that, under certain natural assumptions, large random plane bipartite
maps with a boundary converge after rescaling to a one-parameter family
(\\(\mathrm\{BD\}_L\\), \\(0 < L < \infty\\)) of random metric spaces homeomorphic to the
closed unit disk of \\(\mathbb\{R\}^2\\), the space \\(\mathrm\{BD\}_L\\) being called the
Brownian disk of perimeter \\(L\\) and unit area. These results can be seen as an
extension of the convergence of uniform plane quadrangulations to the Brownian
map, which intuitively corresponds to the limit case where \\(L = 0\\). Similar
results are obtained for maps following a Boltzmann distribution, in which the
perimeter is fixed but the area is random.
