We estimate the rate of convergence for the Kantorovich (or Wasserstein)
distance between empirical measures of i.i.d. random variables associated with
the Laguerre model of order \(\alpha\) on \((0,\infty)^N\) and their common law,
which is not compactly supported and has no rotational symmetry. Compared with
the Gaussian case, our result is sharp provided the parameter \(\alpha\) and the
dimension \(N\) are chosen in a specified regime.
