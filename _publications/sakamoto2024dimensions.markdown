For the simple random walks in percolation clusters on hyperbolic groups, we
show that the associated harmonic measures are exact dimensional and their
Hausdorff dimensions are equal to the entropy over the speed. Our method is
inspired by cluster relations introduced by Gaboriau and applies to a large
class of random environments on the groups.
