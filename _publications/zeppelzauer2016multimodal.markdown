A large amount of social media hosted on platforms like Flickr and Instagram
is related to social events. The task of social event classification refers to
the distinction of event and non-event-related content as well as the
classification of event types (e.g. sports events, concerts, etc.). In this
paper, we provide an extensive study of textual, visual, as well as multimodal
representations for social event classification. We investigate strengths and
weaknesses of the modalities and study synergy effects between the modalities.
Experimental results obtained with our multimodal representation outperform
state-of-the-art methods and provide a new baseline for future research.
