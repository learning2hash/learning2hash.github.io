The field of automated fact-checking increasingly depends on retrieving
web-based evidence to determine the veracity of claims in real-world scenarios.
A significant challenge in this process is not only retrieving relevant
information, but also identifying evidence that can both support and refute
complex claims. Traditional retrieval methods may return documents that
directly address claims or lean toward supporting them, but often struggle with
more complex claims requiring indirect reasoning. While some existing
benchmarks and methods target retrieval for fact-checking, a comprehensive
real-world open-domain benchmark has been lacking. In this paper, we present a
real-world retrieval benchmark FactIR, derived from Factiverse production logs,
enhanced with human annotations. We rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art
retrieval models in a zero-shot setup on FactIR and offer insights for
developing practical retrieval systems for fact-checking. Code and data are
