We consider products of uniform random variables from the Stiefel manifold of
orthonormal \(k\)-frames in \(\mathbb\{R\}^n\), \(k \le n\), and random vectors from
the \(n\)-dimensional \(\ell_p^n\)-ball \(\mathbb\{B\}_p^n\) with certain \(p\)-radial
distributions, \(p\in[1,\infty)\). The distribution of this product geometrically
corresponds to the projection of the \(p\)-radial distribution on
\(\mathbb\{B\}^n_p\) onto a random \(k\)-dimensional subspace. We derive large
deviation principles (LDPs) on the space of probability measures on
\(\mathbb\{R\}^k\) for sequences of such projections.
