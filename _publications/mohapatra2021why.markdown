Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings provide a low-dimensional representation of
entities and relations of a Knowledge Graph and are used successfully for
various applications such as question answering and search, reasoning,
inference, and missing link prediction. However, most of the existing KG
embeddings only consider the network structure of the graph and ignore the
semantics and the characteristics of the underlying ontology that provides
crucial information about relationships between entities in the KG. Recent
efforts in this direction involve learning embeddings for a Description Logic
(logical underpinning for ontologies) named EL++. However, such methods
consider all the relations defined in the ontology to be one-to-one which
severely limits their performance and applications. We provide a simple and
effective solution to overcome this shortcoming that allows such methods to
consider many-to-many relationships while learning embedding representations.
Experiments conducted using three different EL++ ontologies show substantial
performance improvement over five baselines. Our proposed solution also paves
the way for learning embedding representations for even more expressive
description logics such as SROIQ.
