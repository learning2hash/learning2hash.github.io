We say that a given graph \\(G = (V, E)\\) has *pathbreadth* at most \\(\rho\\),
denoted \\(\pb(G) \leq \rho\\), if there exists a Roberston and Seymour's path
decomposition where every bag is contained in the \\(\rho\\)-neighbourhood of some
vertex. Similarly, we say that \\(G\\) has *strong pathbreadth* at most
\\(\rho\\), denoted \\(\spb(G) \leq \rho\\), if there exists a Roberston and Seymour's
path decomposition where every bag is the complete \\(\rho\\)-neighbourhood of some
vertex. It is straightforward that \\(\pb(G) \leq \spb(G)\\) for any graph \\(G\\).
Inspired from a close conjecture in [Leitert and Dragan, COCOA'16], we prove in
this note that \\(\spb(G) \leq 4 \cdot \pb(G)\\).
