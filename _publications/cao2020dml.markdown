With a small number of labeled samples for training, it can save considerable
manpower and material resources, especially when the amount of high spatial
resolution remote sensing images (HSR-RSIs) increases considerably. However,
many deep models face the problem of overfitting when using a small number of
labeled samples. This might degrade HSRRSI retrieval accuracy. Aiming at
obtaining more accurate HSR-RSI retrieval performance with small training
samples, we develop a deep metric learning approach with generative adversarial
network regularization (DML-GANR) for HSR-RSI retrieval. The DML-GANR starts
from a high-level feature extraction (HFE) to extract high-level features,
which includes convolutional layers and fully connected (FC) layers. Each of
the FC layers is constructed by deep metric learning (DML) to maximize the
interclass variations and minimize the intraclass variations. The generative
adversarial network (GAN) is adopted to mitigate the overfitting problem and
validate the qualities of extracted high-level features. DML-GANR is optimized
through a customized approach, and the optimal parameters are obtained. The
experimental results on the three data sets demonstrate the superior
performance of DML-GANR over state-of-the-art techniques in HSR-RSI retrieval.
