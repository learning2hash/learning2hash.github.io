Because word semantics can substantially change across communities and
contexts, capturing domain-specific word semantics is an important challenge.
Here, we propose SEMAXIS, a simple yet powerful framework to characterize word
semantics using many semantic axes in word- vector spaces beyond sentiment. We
demonstrate that SEMAXIS can capture nuanced semantic representations in
multiple online communities. We also show that, when the sentiment axis is
examined, SEMAXIS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in building
domain-specific sentiment lexicons.
