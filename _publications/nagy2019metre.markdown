This paper demonstrates that metre is a privileged indicator of authorial
style in classical Latin hexameter poetry. Using only metrical features,
pairwise classification experiments are performed between 5 first-century
authors (10 comparisons) using four different machine-learning models. The
results showed a two-label classification accuracy of at least 95% with samples
as small as ten lines and no greater than eighty lines (up to around 500
words). These sample sizes are an order of magnitude smaller than those
typically recommended for BOW ('bag of words') or n-gram approaches, and the
reported accuracy is outstanding. Additionally, this paper explores the
potential for novelty (forgery) detection, or 'one-class classification'. An
analysis of the disputed Aldine Additamentum (Sil. Ital. Puni. 8:144-225)
concludes (p=0.0013) that the metrical style differs significantly from that of
the rest of the poem.
