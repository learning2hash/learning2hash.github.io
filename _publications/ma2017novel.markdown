While the visualization of statistical data tends to a mature technology, the
visualization of textual data is still in its infancy, especially for the
artistic text. Due to the fact that visualization of artistic text is valuable
and attractive in both art and information science, we attempt to realize this
tentative idea in this article. We propose the Generative Adversarial Network
based Artistic Textual Visualization (GAN-ATV) which can create paintings after
analyzing the semantic content of existing poems. Our GAN-ATV consists of two
main sections: natural language analysis section and visual information
synthesis section. In natural language analysis section, we use Bag-of-Word
(BoW) feature descriptors and a two-layer network to mine and analyze the
high-level semantic information from poems. In visual information synthesis
section, we design a cross-modal semantic understanding module and integrate it
with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create paintings, whose content
are corresponding to the original poems. Moreover, in order to train our
GAN-ATV and verify its performance, we establish a cross-modal artistic dataset
named "Cross-Art". In the Cross-Art dataset, there are six topics and each
topic has their corresponding paintings and poems. The experimental results on
Cross-Art dataset are shown in this article.
