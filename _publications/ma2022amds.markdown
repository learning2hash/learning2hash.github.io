Symbol-pair codes are proposed to guard against pair-errors in symbol-pair
read channels. The minimum symbol-pair distance is of significance in
determining the error-correcting capability of a symbol-pair code. One of the
central themes in symbol-pair coding theory is the constructions of symbol-pair
codes with largest possible minimum pair distance. Maximum distance separable
(MDS) and almost maximum distance separable (AMDS) symbol-pair codes are
optimal and sub-optimal regarding to the Singleton bound, respectively. In this
paper, six new classes of AMDS symbol-pair codes are explicitly constructed
through repeated-root cyclic codes and one class of such codes has unbounded
lengths and the minimum symbol-pair distance can reach \\(13\\).
