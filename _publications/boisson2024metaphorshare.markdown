The metaphor studies community has developed numerous valuable labelled
corpora in various languages over the years. Many of these resources are not
only unknown to the NLP community, but are also often not easily shared among
the researchers. Both in human sciences and in NLP, researchers could benefit
from a centralised database of labelled resources, easily accessible and
unified under an identical format. To facilitate this, we present
MetaphorShare, a website to integrate metaphor datasets making them open and
accessible. With this effort, our aim is to encourage researchers to share and
upload more datasets in any language in order to facilitate metaphor studies
and the development of future metaphor processing NLP systems. The website has
four main functionalities: upload, download, search and label metaphor
datasets. It is accessible at www.metaphorshare.com.
