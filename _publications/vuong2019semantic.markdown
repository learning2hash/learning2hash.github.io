Currently, the text document retrieval systems have many challenges in
exploring the semantics of queries and documents. Each query implies
information which does not appear in the query but the documents related with
the information are also expected by user. The disadvantage of the previous
spreading activation algorithms could be many irrelevant concepts added to the
query. In this paper, a proposed novel algorithm is only activate and add to
the query named entities which are related with original entities in the query
and explicit relations in the query.
