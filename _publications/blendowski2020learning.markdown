Current deep learning methods are based on the repeated, expensive
application of convolutions with parameter-intensive weight matrices. In this
work, we present a novel concept that enables the application of differentiable
random ferns in end-to-end networks. It can then be used as multiplication-free
convolutional layer alternative in deep network architectures. Our experiments
on the binary classification task of the TUPAC'16 challenge demonstrate
improved results over the state-of-the-art binary XNOR net and only slightly
worse performance than its 2x more parameter intensive floating point CNN
counterpart.
