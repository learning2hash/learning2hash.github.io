Label ranking aims to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a
finite number of predefined labels. Random forest is a powerful and one of the
most successful general-purpose machine learning algorithms of modern times. In
this paper, we present a powerful random forest label ranking method which uses
random decision trees to retrieve nearest neighbors. We have developed a novel
two-step rank aggregation strategy to effectively aggregate neighboring
rankings discovered by the random forest into a final predicted ranking.
Compared with existing methods, the new random forest method has many
advantages including its intrinsically scalable tree data structure, highly
parallel-able computational architecture and much superior performance. We
present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that our new method
achieves the highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art
methods for datasets with complete ranking and datasets with only partial
ranking information.
