Distance-increasing maps from binary vectors to permutations, namely DIMs,
are useful for the construction of permutation arrays. While a simple mapping
algorithm defining DIMs of even length is known, existing DIMs of odd length
are either recursively constructed by merging shorter DIMs or defined by much
complicated mapping algorithms. In this paper, DIMs of all length defined by
simple mapping algorithms are presented.
