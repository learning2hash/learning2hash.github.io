In the field of legal information retrieval, effective embedding-based models
are essential for accurate question-answering systems. However, the scarcity of
large annotated datasets poses a significant challenge, particularly for
Vietnamese legal texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that
leverages large language models to generate high-quality, diverse synthetic
queries for Vietnamese legal passages. This synthetic data is then used to
pre-train retrieval models, specifically bi-encoder and ColBERT, which are
further fine-tuned using contrastive loss with mined hard negatives. Our
experiments demonstrate that these enhancements lead to strong improvement in
retrieval accuracy, validating the effectiveness of synthetic data and
pre-training techniques in overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of
large labeled datasets in the Vietnamese legal domain.
