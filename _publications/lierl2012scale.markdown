We prove a scale-invariant boundary Harnack principle for inner uni- form
domains in metric measure Dirichlet spaces. We assume that the Dirichlet form
is symmetric, strongly local, regular, and that the volume doubling property
and two-sided sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds are satisfied. We make no
assumptions on the pseudo-metric induced by the Dirichlet form, hence the
underlying space can be a fractal space.
