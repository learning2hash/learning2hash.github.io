I present a hybrid matrix factorisation model representing users and items as
linear combinations of their content features' latent factors. The model
outperforms both collaborative and content-based models in cold-start or sparse
interaction data scenarios (using both user and item metadata), and performs at
least as well as a pure collaborative matrix factorisation model where
interaction data is abundant. Additionally, feature embeddings produced by the
model encode semantic information in a way reminiscent of word embedding
approaches, making them useful for a range of related tasks such as tag
recommendations.
