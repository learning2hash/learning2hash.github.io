We show that, for every \(k \ge 2\), every \(k\)-uniform hypergaph of degree
\(\Delta\) and girth at least \(5\) is efficiently \((1+o(1) )(k-1) (\Delta / \ln
\Delta )^\{ 1/(k-1) \} \)-list colorable. As an application (and to the best of
our knowledge) we obtain the currently best algorithm for list-coloring random
hypergraphs of bounded average degree.
