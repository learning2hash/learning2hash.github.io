We show, as our main theorem, that if a Lipschitz map from a compact
Riemannian manifold \\(M\\) to a connected compact Riemannian manifold \\(N\\), where
\\(\dim M \geq \dim N\\), has no singular points on \\(M\\) in the sense of F.H.
Clarke, then the map admits a smooth approximation via Ehresmann fibrations. We
also show the Reeb sphere theorem for Lipschitz functions, i.e., if a closed
Riemannian manifold admits a Lipschitz function with exactly two singular
points in the sense of Clarke, then the manifold is homeomorphic to the sphere.
