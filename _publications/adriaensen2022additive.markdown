We support some evidence that a long additive MDS code over a finite field
must be equivalent to a linear code. More precisely, let \\(C\\) be an \\(\mathbb
F_q\\)-linear \\((n,q^\{hk\},n-k+1)_\{q^h\}\\) MDS code over \\(\mathbb F_\{q^h\}\\). If \\(k=3\\),
\\(h \in \\{2,3\\}\\), \\(n > \max \\{q^\{h-1\},h q -1\\} + 3\\), and \\(C\\) has three
coordinates from which its projections are equivalent to linear codes, we prove
that \\(C\\) itself is equivalent to a linear code. If \\(k>3\\), \\(n > q+k\\), and there
are two disjoint subsets of coordinates whose combined size is at most \\(k-2\\)
from which the projections of \\(C\\) are equivalent to linear codes, we prove that
\\(C\\) is equivalent to a code which is linear over a larger field than \\(\mathbb
F_q\\).
