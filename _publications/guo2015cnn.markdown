Along with data on the web increasing dramatically hashing is becoming more and more popular as a method of approximate nearest neighbor search. Previous supervised hashing methods utilized similarity/dissimilarity matrix to get semantic information. But the matrix is not easy to construct for a new dataset. Rather than to reconstruct the matrix we proposed a straightforward CNN45;based hashing method i.e. binarilizing the activations of a fully connected layer with threshold 0 and taking the binary result as hash codes. This method achieved the best performance on CIFAR45;10 and was comparable with the state45;of45;the45;art on MNIST. And our experiments on CIFAR45;10 suggested that the signs of activations may carry more information than the relative values of activations between samples and that the co45;adaption between feature extractor and hash functions is important for hashing.
