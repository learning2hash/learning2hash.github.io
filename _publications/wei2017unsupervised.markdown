Reusable model design becomes desirable with the rapid expansion of computer
vision and machine learning applications. In this paper, we focus on the
reusability of pre-trained deep convolutional models. Specifically, different
from treating pre-trained models as feature extractors, we reveal more
treasures beneath convolutional layers, i.e., the convolutional activations
could act as a detector for the common object in the image co-localization
problem. We propose a simple yet effective method, termed Deep Descriptor
Transforming (DDT), for evaluating the correlations of descriptors and then
obtaining the category-consistent regions, which can accurately locate the
common object in a set of unlabeled images, i.e., unsupervised object
discovery. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDT
method. On benchmark image co-localization datasets, DDT consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Moreover, DDT
also demonstrates good generalization ability for unseen categories and
robustness for dealing with noisy data. Beyond those, DDT can be also employed
for harvesting web images into valid external data sources for improving
performance of both image recognition and object detection.
