Let \(X\) be a simplicial complex with a piecewise linear function
\(f:X\to\mathbb\{R\}\). The Reeb graph \(Reeb(f,X)\) is the quotient of \(X\), where we
collapse each connected component of \(f^\{-1\}(t)\) to a single point. Let the
nodes of \(Reeb(f,X)\) be all homologically critical points where any homology of
the corresponding component of the level set \(f^\{-1\}(t)\) changes. Then we can
label every arc of \(Reeb(f,X)\) with the Betti numbers
\((\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_d)\) of the corresponding \(d\)-dimensional
component of a level set. The homology labels give more information about the
original complex \(X\) than the classical Reeb graph. We describe a canonical
embedding of a Reeb graph into a multi-page book (a star cross a line) and give
a unique linear code of this book embedding.
