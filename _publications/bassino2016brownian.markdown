We study random uniform permutations in an important class of
pattern-avoiding permutations: the separable permutations. We describe the
asymptotics of the number of occurrences of any fixed given pattern in such a
random permutation in terms of the Brownian excursion. In the recent
terminology of permutons, our work can be interpreted as the convergence of
uniform random separable permutations towards a "Brownian separable permuton".
