This paper exemplifies the implementation of an efficient Information
Retrieval (IR) System to compute the similarity between a dataset and a query
using Fuzzy Logic. TREC dataset has been used for the same purpose. The dataset
is parsed to generate keywords index which is used for the similarity
comparison with the user query. Each query is assigned a score value based on
its fuzzy similarity with the index keywords. The relevant documents are
retrieved based on the score value. The performance and accuracy of the
proposed fuzzy similarity model is compared with Cosine similarity model using
Precision-Recall curves. The results prove the dominance of Fuzzy Similarity
based IR system.
