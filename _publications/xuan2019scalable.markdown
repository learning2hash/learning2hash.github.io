Recently, generated images could reach very high quality, even human eyes
could not tell them apart from real images. Although there are already some
methods for detecting generated images in current forensic community, most of
these methods are used to detect a single type of generated images. The new
types of generated images are emerging one after another, and the existing
detection methods cannot cope well. These problems prompted us to propose a
scalable framework for multi-class classification based on deep metric
learning, which aims to classify the generated images finer. In addition, we
have increased the scalability of our framework to cope with the constant
emergence of new types of generated images, and through fine-tuning to make the
model obtain better detection performance on the new type of generated data.
