Perhaps the most straightforward classifier in the arsenal or machine
learning techniques is the Nearest Neighbour Classifier -- classification is
achieved by identifying the nearest neighbours to a query example and using
those neighbours to determine the class of the query. This approach to
classification is of particular importance because issues of poor run-time
performance is not such a problem these days with the computational power that
is available. This paper presents an overview of techniques for Nearest
Neighbour classification focusing on; mechanisms for assessing similarity
(distance), computational issues in identifying nearest neighbours and
mechanisms for reducing the dimension of the data.
  This paper is the second edition of a paper previously published as a
technical report. Sections on similarity measures for time-series, retrieval
speed-up and intrinsic dimensionality have been added. An Appendix is included
providing access to Python code for the key methods.
