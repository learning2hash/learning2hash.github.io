In this paper, we describe a framework for similarity based retrieval and
clustering from a 3D human database. Our technique is based on both body and
head shape representation and the retrieval is based on similarity of both of
them. The 3D human database used in our study is the CAESAR anthropometric
database which contains approximately 5000 bodies. We have developed a
web-based interface for specifying the queries to interact with the retrieval
system. Our approach performs the similarity based retrieval in a reasonable
amount of time and is a practical approach.
