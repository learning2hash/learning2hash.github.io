Text indexing, the problem in which one desires to preprocess a (usually
large) text for future (shorter) queries, has been researched ever since the
suffix tree was invented in the early 70's. With textual data continuing to
increase and with changes in the way it is accessed, new data structures and
new algorithmic methods are continuously required. Therefore, text indexing is
of utmost importance and is a very active research domain.
  Orthogonal range searching, classically associated with the computational
geometry community, is one of the tools that has increasingly become important
for various text indexing applications. Initially, in the mid 90's there were a
couple of results recognizing this connection. In the last few years we have
seen an increase in use of this method and are reaching a deeper understanding
of the range searching uses for text indexing.
  In this monograph we survey some of these results.
