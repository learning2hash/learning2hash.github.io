In this work we present a novel compact scene representation based on Stixels
that infers geometric and semantic information. Our approach overcomes the
previous rather restrictive geometric assumptions for Stixels by introducing a
novel depth model to account for non-flat roads and slanted objects. Both
semantic and depth cues are used jointly to infer the scene representation in a
sound global energy minimization formulation. Furthermore, a novel
approximation scheme is introduced that uses an extremely efficient
over-segmentation. In doing so, the computational complexity of the Stixel
inference algorithm is reduced significantly, achieving real-time computation
capabilities with only a slight drop in accuracy. We evaluate the proposed
approach in terms of semantic and geometric accuracy as well as run-time on
four publicly available benchmark datasets. Our approach maintains accuracy on
flat road scene datasets while improving substantially on a novel non-flat road
dataset.
