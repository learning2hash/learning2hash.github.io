Music similarity retrieval is fundamental for managing and exploring relevant content from large collections in streaming platforms. This paper presents a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework that leverages the open-ended nature of text descriptions to guide music similarity modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional uni-modal approaches in capturing complex musical relationships. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. Exten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music streaming platform.
