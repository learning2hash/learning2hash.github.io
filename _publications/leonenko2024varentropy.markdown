The Varentropy is a measure of the variability of the information content of
random vector and it is invariant under affine transformations. We introduce
the statistical estimate of varentropy of random vector based on the nearest
neighbor graphs (distances). The asymptotic unbiasedness and L2-consistency of
the estimates are established.
