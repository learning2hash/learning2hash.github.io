Linking named entities occurring in text to their corresponding entity in a
Knowledge Base (KB) is challenging, especially when dealing with historical
texts. In this work, we introduce Musical Heritage named Entities Recognition,
Classification and Linking (MHERCL), a novel benchmark consisting of manually
annotated sentences extrapolated from historical periodicals of the music
domain. MHERCL contains named entities under-represented or absent in the most
famous KBs. We experiment with several State-of-the-Art models on the Entity
Linking (EL) task and show that MHERCL is a challenging dataset for all of
them. We propose a novel unsupervised EL model and a method to extend
supervised entity linkers by using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to tackle the main
difficulties posed by historical documents. Our experiments reveal that relying
on unsupervised techniques and improving models with logical constraints based
on KGs and heuristics to predict NIL entities (entities not represented in the
KB of reference) results in better EL performance on historical documents.
