We introduce Object-Guided Localization (OGuL) based on a novel method of
local-feature matching. Direct matching of local features is sensitive to
significant changes in illumination. In contrast, object detection often
survives severe changes in lighting conditions. The proposed method first
detects semantic objects and establishes correspondences of those objects
between images. Object correspondences provide local coarse alignment of the
images in the form of a planar homography. These homographies are consequently
used to guide the matching of local features. Experiments on standard urban
localization datasets (Aachen, Extended-CMU-Season, RobotCar-Season) show that
OGuL significantly improves localization results with as simple local features
as SIFT, and its performance competes with the state-of-the-art CNN-based
methods trained for day-to-night localization.
