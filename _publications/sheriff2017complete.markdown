Dictionaries are collections of vectors used for representations of elements
in Euclidean spaces. While recent research on optimal dictionaries is focussed
on providing sparse (i.e., \(\ell_0\)-optimal,) representations, here we consider
the problem of finding optimal dictionaries such that representations of
samples of a random vector are optimal in an \(ℓ₂\)-sense. For us, optimality
of representation is equivalent to minimization of the average \(ℓ₂\)-norm of
the coefficients used to represent the random vector, with the lengths of the
dictionary vectors being specified a priori. With the help of recent results on
rank-\(1\) decompositions of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices and the
theory of majorization, we provide a complete characterization of
\(ℓ₂\)-optimal dictionaries. Our results are accompanied by polynomial time
algorithms that construct \(ℓ₂\)-optimal dictionaries from given data.
