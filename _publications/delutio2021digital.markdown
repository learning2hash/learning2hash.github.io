Automatic identification of plant specimens from amateur photographs could
improve species range maps, thus supporting ecosystems research as well as
conservation efforts. However, classifying plant specimens based on image data
alone is challenging: some species exhibit large variations in visual
appearance, while at the same time different species are often visually
similar; additionally, species observations follow a highly imbalanced,
long-tailed distribution due to differences in abundance as well as observer
biases. On the other hand, most species observations are accompanied by side
information about the spatial, temporal and ecological context. Moreover,
biological species are not an unordered list of classes but embedded in a
hierarchical taxonomic structure. We propose a multimodal deep learning model
that takes into account these additional cues in a unified framework. Our
Digital Taxonomist is able to identify plant species in photographs better than
a classifier trained on the image content alone, the performance gained is over
6 percent points in terms of accuracy.
