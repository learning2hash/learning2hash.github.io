In this work, we consider the problem of synchronizing two sets of data where
the size of the symmetric difference between the sets is small and, in
addition, the elements in the symmetric difference are related through the
Hamming distance metric. Upper and lower bounds are derived on the minimum
amount of information exchange. Furthermore, explicit encoding and decoding
algorithms are provided for many cases.
