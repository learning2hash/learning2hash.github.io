Autoencoders are techniques for data representation learning based on
artificial neural networks. Differently to other feature learning methods which
may be focused on finding specific transformations of the feature space, they
can be adapted to fulfill many purposes, such as data visualization, denoising,
anomaly detection and semantic hashing. This work presents these applications
and provides details on how autoencoders can perform them, including code
samples making use of an R package with an easy-to-use interface for
autoencoder design and training, \texttt\{ruta\}. Along the way, the explanations
on how each learning task has been achieved are provided with the aim to help
the reader design their own autoencoders for these or other objectives.
