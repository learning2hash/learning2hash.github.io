In this paper we present a near-complete dataset of over 3M videos from 61K
channels over 2.5 years (June 2019 to December 2021) from the social video
hosting platform BitChute, a commonly used alternative to YouTube.
Additionally, we include a variety of video-level metadata, including comments,
channel descriptions, and views for each video. The MeLa-BitChute dataset can
