Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos
guided by natural language descriptions. We propose FS-RVOS, a
Transformer-based model with two key components: a cross-modal affinity module
and an instance sequence matching strategy, which extends FS-RVOS to
multi-object segmentation (FS-RVMOS). Experiments show FS-RVOS and FS-RVMOS
outperform state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating
superior robustness and accuracy.
