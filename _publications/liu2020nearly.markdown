In this paper, we study the statistical properties of kernel \(k\)-means and
obtain a nearly optimal excess clustering risk bound, substantially improving
the state-of-art bounds in the existing clustering risk analyses. We further
analyze the statistical effect of computational approximations of the
Nystr\"\{o\}m kernel \(k\)-means, and prove that it achieves the same statistical
accuracy as the exact kernel \(k\)-means considering only \(Î©(\sqrt\{nk\})\)
Nystr\"\{o\}m landmark points. To the best of our knowledge, such sharp excess
clustering risk bounds for kernel (or approximate kernel) \(k\)-means have never
been proposed before.
