We show that for a uniformly irreducible random walk on a graph, with bounded
range, there is a Floyd function for which the random walk converges to its
corresponding Floyd boundary. Moreover if we add the assumptions,
\\(p^\{(n)\}(v,w)\leq C \rho^n\\), where \\(\rho < 1\\) is the spectral radius, then for
any Floyd function \\(f\\) that satisfies \\(\sum_\{n=1\}^\{\infty\}nf(n)<\infty\\), the
Dirichlet problem with respect to the Floyd boundary is solvable.
