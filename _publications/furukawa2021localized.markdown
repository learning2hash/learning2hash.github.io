We propose a new information aggregation method which called Localized
Feature Aggregation Module based on the similarity between the feature maps of
an encoder and a decoder. The proposed method recovers positional information
by emphasizing the similarity between decoder's feature maps with superior
semantic information and encoder's feature maps with superior positional
information. The proposed method can learn positional information more
efficiently than conventional concatenation in the U-net and attention U-net.
Additionally, the proposed method also uses localized attention range to reduce
the computational cost. Two innovations contributed to improve the segmentation
accuracy with lower computational cost. By experiments on the Drosophila cell
image dataset and COVID-19 image dataset, we confirmed that our method
outperformed conventional methods.
