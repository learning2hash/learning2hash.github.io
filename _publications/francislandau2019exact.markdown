Prior methods for retrieval of nearest neighbors in high dimensions are fast
and approximate--providing probabilistic guarantees of returning the correct
answer--or slow and exact performing an exhaustive search. We present Certified
Cosine, a novel approach to nearest-neighbors which takes advantage of
structure present in the cosine similarity distance metric to offer
certificates. When a certificate is constructed, it guarantees that the nearest
neighbor set is correct, possibly avoiding an exhaustive search. Certified
Cosine's certificates work with high dimensional data and outperform previous
exact nearest neighbor methods on these datasets.
