Recent results of deep convolutional networks in visual recognition
challenges open the path to a whole new set of disruptive user experiences such
as visual search or recommendation. The list of companies offering this type of
service is growing everyday but the adoption rate and the relevancy of results
may vary a lot. We believe that the availability of large and diverse datasets
is a necessary condition to improve the relevancy of such recommendation
systems and facilitate their adoption. For that purpose, we wish to share with
the community this dataset of more than 12M images of the 7M products of our
online store classified into 5K categories. This original dataset is introduced
in this article and several features are described. We also present some
aspects of the winning solutions of our image classification challenge that was
organized on the Kaggle platform around this set of images.
