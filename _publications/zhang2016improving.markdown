To improve the temporal and spatial storage efficiency, researchers have
intensively studied various techniques, including compression and
deduplication. Through our evaluation, we find that methods such as photo tags
or local features help to identify the content-based similar- ity between raw
images. The images can then be com- pressed more efficiently to get better
storage space sav- ings. Furthermore, storing similar raw images together
enables rapid data sorting, searching and retrieval if the images are stored in
a distributed and large-scale envi- ronment by reducing fragmentation. In this
paper, we evaluated the compressibility by designing experiments and observing
the results. We found that on a statistical basis the higher similarity photos
have, the better com- pression results are. This research helps provide a clue
for future large-scale storage system design.
