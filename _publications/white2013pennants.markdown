We present a new technique (called pennants) for displaying the descriptors
related to a descriptor across literatures, rather in a thesaurus. It has
definite implications for online searching and browsing. Pennants, named for
the flag they resemble, are a form of algorithmic prediction. Their cognitive
base is in relevance theory (RT) from linguistic pragmatics (Sperber & Wilson
1995).
