The minutia descriptor which describes characteristics of minutia, plays a
major role in fingerprint recognition. Typically, fingerprint recognition
systems employ minutia descriptors to find potential correspondence between
minutiae, and they use similarity between two minutia descriptors to calculate
overall similarity between two fingerprint images. A good minutia descriptor
can improve recognition accuracy of fingerprint recognition system and largely
reduce comparing time. A good minutia descriptor should have high ability to
distinguish between different minutiae and at the same time should be robust in
difficult conditions including poor quality image and small size image. It also
should be effective in computational cost of similarity among descriptors. In
this paper, a robust minutia descriptor is constructed using Gabor wavelet and
linear discriminant analysis. This minutia descriptor has high distinguishing
ability, stability and simple comparing method. Experimental results on FVC2004
and FVC2006 databases show that the proposed minutia descriptor is very
effective in fingerprint recognition.
