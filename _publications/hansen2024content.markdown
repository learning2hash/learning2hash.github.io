<p>Content-aware recommendation approaches are essential for providing
meaningful recommendations for new (i.e., cold-start) items in a
recommender system. We present a content-aware neural hashing-based
collaborative filtering approach (NeuHash-CF), which generates binary
hash codes for users and items, such that the highly efficient Hamming
distance can be used for estimating user-item relevance. NeuHash-CF is
modelled as an autoencoder architecture, consisting of two joint hashing
components for generating user and item hash codes. Inspired from
semantic hashing, the item hashing component generates a hash code
directly from an item’s content information (i.e., it generates
cold-start and seen item hash codes in the same manner). This contrasts
existing state-of-the-art models, which treat the two item cases
separately. The user hash codes are generated directly based on user id,
through learning a user embedding matrix. We show experimentally that
NeuHash-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
12% NDCG and 13% MRR in cold-start recommendation settings, and up to 4%
in both NDCG and MRR in standard settings where all items are present
while training. Our approach uses 2-4x shorter hash codes, while
obtaining the same or better performance compared to the state of the
art, thus consequently also enabling a notable storage reduction.</p>
