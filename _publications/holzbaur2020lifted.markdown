Lifted Reed-Solomon codes and multiplicity codes are two classes of
evaluation codes that allow for the design of high-rate codes that can recover
every codeword or information symbol from many disjoint sets. Recently, the
underlying approaches have been combined to construct lifted bi-variate
multiplicity codes, that can further improve on the rate. We continue the study
of these codes by providing lower bounds on the rate and distance for lifted
multiplicity codes obtained from polynomials in an arbitrary number of
variables. Specifically, we investigate a subcode of a lifted multiplicity code
formed by the linear span of \\(m\\)-variate monomials whose restriction to an
arbitrary line in \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^m\\) is equivalent to a low-degree uni-variate
polynomial. We find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such
monomials when the number of variables \\(m\\) is fixed and the alphabet size
\\(q=2^\ell\\) is large. For some parameter regimes, lifted multiplicity codes are
then shown to have a better trade-off between redundancy and the number of
disjoint recovering sets for every codeword or information symbol than
previously known constructions. Additionally, we present a local
self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.
