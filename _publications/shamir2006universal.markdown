Universal compression of patterns of sequences generated by independently
identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources with unknown, possibly large,
alphabets is investigated. A pattern is a sequence of indices that contains all
consecutive indices in increasing order of first occurrence. If the alphabet of
a source that generated a sequence is unknown, the inevitable cost of coding
the unknown alphabet symbols can be exploited to create the pattern of the
sequence. This pattern can in turn be compressed by itself. It is shown that if
the alphabet size \(k\) is essentially small, then the average minimax and
maximin redundancies as well as the redundancy of every code for almost every
source, when compressing a pattern, consist of at least 0.5 log(n/k^3) bits per
each unknown probability parameter, and if all alphabet letters are likely to
occur, there exist codes whose redundancy is at most 0.5 log(n/k^2) bits per
each unknown probability parameter, where n is the length of the data
sequences. Otherwise, if the alphabet is large, these redundancies are
essentially at least O(n^\{-2/3\}) bits per symbol, and there exist codes that
achieve redundancy of essentially O(n^\{-1/2\}) bits per symbol. Two sub-optimal
low-complexity sequential algorithms for compression of patterns are presented
and their description lengths analyzed, also pointing out that the pattern
average universal description length can decrease below the underlying i.i.d.\
entropy for large enough alphabets.
