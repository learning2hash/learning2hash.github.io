Aggregating deep convolutional features into a global image vector has
attracted sustained attention in image retrieval. In this paper, we propose an
efficient unsupervised aggregation method that uses an adaptive Gaussian filter
and an elementvalue sensitive vector to co-weight deep features. Specifically,
the Gaussian filter assigns large weights to features of region-of-interests
(RoI) by adaptively determining the RoI's center, while the element-value
sensitive channel vector suppresses burstiness phenomenon by assigning small
weights to feature maps with large sum values of all locations. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets validate the proposed two weighting schemes both
effectively improve the discrimination power of image vectors. Furthermore,
with the same experimental setting, our method outperforms other very recent
aggregation approaches by a considerable margin.
