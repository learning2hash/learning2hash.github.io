Sarcasm detection is the task of identifying irony containing utterances in
sentiment-bearing text. However, the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm
poses a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment
analysis. This article compiles and reviews the salient work in the literature
of automatic sarcasm detection. Thus far, three main paradigm shifts have
occurred in the way researchers have approached this task: 1) semi-supervised
pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, 2) use of hashtag-based
supervision, and 3) incorporation of context beyond target text. In this
article, we provide a comprehensive review of the datasets, approaches, trends,
and issues in sarcasm and irony detection.
