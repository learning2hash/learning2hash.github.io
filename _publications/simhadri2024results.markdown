The 2023 Big ANN Challenge, held at NeurIPS 2023, focused on advancing the
state-of-the-art in indexing data structures and search algorithms for
practical variants of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search that reflect
the growing complexity and diversity of workloads. Unlike prior challenges that
emphasized scaling up classical ANN search
~\cite\{DBLP:conf/nips/SimhadriWADBBCH21\}, this competition addressed filtered
search, out-of-distribution data, sparse and streaming variants of ANNS.
Participants developed and submitted innovative solutions that were evaluated
on new standard datasets with constrained computational resources. The results
showcased significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency over
industry-standard baselines, with notable contributions from both academic and
industrial teams. This paper summarizes the competition tracks, datasets,
evaluation metrics, and the innovative approaches of the top-performing
submissions, providing insights into the current advancements and future
directions in the field of approximate nearest neighbor search.
