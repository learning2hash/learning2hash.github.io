We describe NorDiaChange: the first diachronic semantic change dataset for
Norwegian. NorDiaChange comprises two novel subsets, covering about 80
Norwegian nouns manually annotated with graded semantic change over time. Both
datasets follow the same annotation procedure and can be used interchangeably
as train and test splits for each other. NorDiaChange covers the time periods
related to pre- and post-war events, oil and gas discovery in Norway, and
technological developments. The annotation was done using the DURel framework
and two large historical Norwegian corpora. NorDiaChange is published in full
under a permissive licence, complete with raw annotation data and inferred
diachronic word usage graphs (DWUGs).
