Hashing functions, which are created to provide brief and erratic digests for
the message entered, are the primary cryptographic primitives used in
blockchain networks. Hashing is employed in blockchain networks to create
linked block lists, which offer safe and secure distributed repository storage
for critical information. Due to the unique nature of the hash search problem
in blockchain networks, the most parallelization of calculations is possible.
This technical report presents a performance evaluation of three popular
hashing algorithms Blake3, SHA-256, and SHA-512. These hashing algorithms are
widely used in various applications, such as digital signatures, message
authentication, and password storage. It then discusses the performance metrics
used to evaluate the algorithms, such as hash rate/throughput and memory usage.
The evaluation is conducted on a range of hardware platforms, including desktop
and VMs. The evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks. The results of the
evaluation show that Blake3 generally outperforms both SHA-256 and SHA-512 in
terms of throughput and latency. However, the performance advantage of Blake3
varies depending on the specific hardware platform and the size of the input
data. The report concludes with recommendations for selecting the most suitable
hashing algorithm for a given application, based on its performance
requirements and security needs. The evaluation results can also inform future
research and development efforts to improve the performance and security of
hashing algorithms.
