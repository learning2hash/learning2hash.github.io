Place recognition is one of the most fundamental topics in computer vision
and robotics communities, where the task is to accurately and efficiently
recognize the location of a given query image. Despite years of wisdom
accumulated in this field, place recognition still remains an open problem due
to the various ways in which the appearance of real-world places may differ.
This paper presents an overview of the place recognition literature. Since
condition invariant and viewpoint invariant features are essential factors to
long-term robust visual place recognition system, We start with traditional
image description methodology developed in the past, which exploit techniques
from image retrieval field. Recently, the rapid advances of related fields such
as object detection and image classification have inspired a new technique to
improve visual place recognition system, i.e., convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Thus we then introduce recent progress of visual place recognition
system based on CNNs to automatically learn better image representations for
places. Eventually, we close with discussions and future work of place
recognition.
