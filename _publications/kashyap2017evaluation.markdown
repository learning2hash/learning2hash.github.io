With the headway of the advanced image handling software and altering tools,
a computerized picture can be effectively controlled. The identification of
image manipulation is vital in light of the fact that an image can be utilized
as legitimate confirmation, in crime scene investigation, and in numerous
different fields. The image forgery detection techniques intend to confirm the
credibility of computerized pictures with no prior information about the
original image. There are numerous routes for altering a picture, for example,
resampling, splicing, and copy-move. In this paper, we have examined different
type of image forgery and their detection techniques; mainly we focused on
pixel based image forgery detection techniques.
