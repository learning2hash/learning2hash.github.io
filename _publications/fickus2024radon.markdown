Every equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF) is a type of optimal code in
a Grassmannian, consisting of subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space
for which the smallest principal angle between any pair of them is as large as
possible. EITFFs yield dictionaries with minimal block coherence and so are
ideal for certain types of compressed sensing. By refining classical work of
Lemmens and Seidel based on Radon-Hurwitz theory, we fully characterize EITFFs
in the special case where the dimension of the subspaces is exactly one-half of
that of the ambient space. We moreover show that each such "Radon-Hurwitz
EITFF" is highly symmetric, where every even permutation is an automorphism.
