Device fingerprints like sensor pattern noise (SPN) are widely used for
provenance analysis and image authentication. Over the past few years, the
rapid advancement in digital photography has greatly reshaped the pipeline of
image capturing process on consumer-level mobile devices. The flexibility of
camera parameter settings and the emergence of multi-frame photography
algorithms, especially high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, bring new challenges
to device fingerprinting. The subsequent study on these topics requires a new
purposefully built image dataset. In this paper, we present the Warwick Image
Forensics Dataset, an image dataset of more than 58,600 images captured using
14 digital cameras with various exposure settings. Special attention to the
exposure settings allows the images to be adopted by different multi-frame
computational photography algorithms and for subsequent device fingerprinting.
The dataset is released as an open-source, free for use for the digital
forensic community.
