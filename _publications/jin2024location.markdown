The precise diagnosis of urinary stones is crucial for devising effective
treatment strategies. The diagnostic process, however, is often complicated by
the low contrast between stones and surrounding tissues, as well as the
variability in stone locations across different patients. To address this
issue, we propose a novel location embedding based pairwise distance learning
network (LEPD-Net) that leverages low-dose abdominal X-ray imaging combined
with location information for the fine-grained diagnosis of urinary stones.
LEPD-Net enhances the representation of stone-related features through
context-aware region enhancement, incorporates critical location knowledge via
stone location embedding, and achieves recognition of fine-grained objects with
our innovative fine-grained pairwise distance learning. Additionally, we have
established an in-house dataset on urinary tract stones to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Comprehensive experiments conducted on
this dataset reveal that our framework significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods.
