The blockchain system has emerged as one of the focal points of research in
recent years, particularly in applications and services such as
cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. In this context, the hash value serves as
a crucial element in linking blocks within the blockchain, ensuring the
integrity of block contents. Therefore, hash algorithms represent a vital
security technology for ensuring the integrity and security of blockchain
systems. This study primarily focuses on analyzing the security and execution
efficiency of mainstream hash algorithms in the Proof of Work (PoW)
calculations within blockchain systems. It proposes an evaluation factor and
conducts comparative experiments to evaluate each hash algorithm. The
experimental results indicate that there are no significant differences in the
security aspects among SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2. However, SHA-2 and BLAKE2
demonstrate shorter computation times, indicating higher efficiency in
execution.
