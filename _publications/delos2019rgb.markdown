Usual approaches for image recoloring, such as local filtering by transfer
functions and global histogram remapping, lack of accurate control or miss
small groups of important pixels. In this paper, we introduce a triangle-based
structuring of the colors of an image in the RGB space. We present an analysis
of image colors in the RGB space showing the theoretical motivation of our
triangular abstraction. We illustrate the usefulness of our structure to
recolor images.
