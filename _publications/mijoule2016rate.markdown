A consequence of de Finetti's representation theorem is that for every
infinite sequence of exchangeable 0-1 random variables \((X_k)_\{k\geq1\}\), there
exists a probability measure \(\mu\) on the Borel sets of \([0,1]\) such that \(\bar
X_n = n^\{-1\} \sum_\{i=1\}^n X_i\) converges weakly to \(\mu\). For a wide class of
probability measures \(\mu\) having smooth density on \((0,1)\), we give bounds of
order \(1/n\) with explicit constants for the Wasserstein distance between the
law of \(\bar X_n\) and \(\mu\). This extends a recent result \{by\} Goldstein and
Reinert \cite\{goldstein2013stein\} regarding the distance between the scaled
number of white balls drawn in a P\'olya-Eggenberger urn and its limiting
distribution. We prove also that, in the most general cases, the distance
between the law of \(\bar X_n\) and \(\mu\) is bounded below by \(1/n\) and above by
\(1/\sqrt\{n\}\) (up to some multiplicative constants). For every \(\delta \in
[1/2,1]\), we give an example of an exchangeable sequence such that this
distance is of order \(1/n^\delta\).
