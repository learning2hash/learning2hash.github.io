<p>Big data is becoming ever more ubiquitous, ranging over massive video
repositories, document corpuses, image sets and Internet routing
history. Proximity search and clustering are two algorithmic primitives
fundamental to data analysis, but suffer from the “curse of
dimensionality” on these gigantic datasets. A popular attack for this
problem is to convert object representations into short binary
codewords, while approximately preserving near neighbor structure.
However, there has been limited research on constructing codewords in
the “streaming” or “online” settings often applicable to this scale of
data, where one may only make a single pass over data too massive to fit
in local memory. In this paper, we apply recent advances in matrix
sketching techniques to construct binary codewords in both streaming and
online setting. Our experimental results compete outperform several of
the most popularly used algorithms, and we prove theoretical guarantees
on performance in the streaming setting under mild assumptions on the
data and randomness of the training set.</p>
