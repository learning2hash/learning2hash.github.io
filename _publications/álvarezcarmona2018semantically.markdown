Paraphrase plagiarism identification represents a very complex task given
that plagiarized texts are intentionally modified through several rewording
techniques. Accordingly, this paper introduces two new measures for evaluating
the relatedness of two given texts: a semantically-informed similarity measure
and a semantically-informed edit distance. Both measures are able to extract
semantic information from either an external resource or a distributed
representation of words, resulting in informative features for training a
supervised classifier for detecting paraphrase plagiarism. Obtained results
indicate that the proposed metrics are consistently good in detecting different
types of paraphrase plagiarism. In addition, results are very competitive
against state-of-the art methods having the advantage of representing a much
more simple but equally effective solution.
