We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing image style transfer -
the task of rendering one image in the style of another image. The dataset
covers various content and style images of different size and contains 10.000
stylizations manually rated by three annotators in 1-10 scale. Based on
obtained ratings, we find which factors are mostly responsible for favourable
and poor user evaluations and show quantitative measures having statistically
significant impact on user grades. A methodology for creating style transfer
datasets is discussed. Presented dataset can be used in automating multiple
tasks, related to style transfer configuration and evaluation.
