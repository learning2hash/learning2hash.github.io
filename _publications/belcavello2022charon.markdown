This paper presents Charon, a web tool for annotating multimodal corpora with
FrameNet categories. Annotation can be made for corpora containing both static
images and video sequences paired - or not - with text sequences. The pipeline
features, besides the annotation interface, corpus import and pre-processing
tools.
