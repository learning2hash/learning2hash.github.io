In the trace reconstruction problem, the goal is to reconstruct an unknown
string \(x\) of length \(n\) from multiple traces obtained by passing \(x\) through
the deletion channel. In the relaxed problem of \(approximate\) trace
reconstruction, the goal is to reconstruct an approximation \(\widehat\{x\}\) of
\(x\) which is close (within \(\epsilon n\)) to \(x\) in edit distance. We show that
for most strings \(x\), this is possible with high probability using only a
constant number of traces. Crucially, this constant does not grow with \(n\), and
only depends on the deletion probability and \(\epsilon\).
