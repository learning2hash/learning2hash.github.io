We present POTATO, the Portable text annotation tool, a free, fully
open-sourced annotation system that 1) supports labeling many types of text and
multimodal data; 2) offers easy-to-configure features to maximize the
productivity of both deployers and annotators (convenient templates for common
ML/NLP tasks, active learning, keypress shortcuts, keyword highlights,
tooltips); and 3) supports a high degree of customization (editable UI,
inserting pre-screening questions, attention and qualification tests).
Experiments over two annotation tasks suggest that POTATO improves labeling
speed through its specially-designed productivity features, especially for long
documents and complex tasks. POTATO is available at
https://github.com/davidjurgens/potato and will continue to be updated.
