We propose Visual Query Detection (VQD), a new visual grounding task. In VQD,
a system is guided by natural language to localize a variable number of objects
in an image. VQD is related to visual referring expression recognition, where
the task is to localize only one object. We describe the first dataset for VQD
and we propose baseline algorithms that demonstrate the difficulty of the task
compared to referring expression recognition.
