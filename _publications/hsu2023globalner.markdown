Nowadays, many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks see the demand for
incorporating knowledge external to the local information to further improve
the performance. However, there is little related work on Named Entity
Recognition (NER), which is one of the foundations of NLP. Specifically, no
studies were conducted on the query generation and re-ranking for retrieving
the related information for the purpose of improving NER. This work
demonstrates the effectiveness of a DNN-based query generation method and a
mention-aware re-ranking architecture based on BERTScore particularly for NER.
In the end, a state-of-the-art performance of 61.56 micro-f1 score on WNUT17
dataset is achieved.
