Given a linear code \\(\mathcal\{C\}\\), its square code \\(\mathcal\{C\}^\{(2)\}\\) is the
span of all component-wise products of two elements of \\(\mathcal\{C\}\\). Motivated
by applications in multi-party computation, our purpose with this work is to
answer the following question: which families of affine variety codes have
simultaneously high dimension \\(k(\mathcal\{C\})\\) and high minimum distance of
\\(\mathcal\{C\}^\{(2)\}\\), \\(d(\mathcal\{C\}^\{(2)\})\\)? More precisely, given a designed
minimum distance \\(d\\) we compute an affine variety code \\(\mathcal\{C\}\\) such that
\\(d(\mathcal\{C\}^\{(2)\})\geq d\\) and that the dimension of \\(\mathcal\{C\}\\) is high.
The best construction that we propose comes from hyperbolic codes when \\(d\ge q\\)
and from weighted Reed-Muller codes otherwise.
