We prove that large Boltzmann stable planar maps of index \(\alpha \in (1;2)\) converge in the scaling limit towards a random compact metric space \(\mathcal\{S\}_\{\alpha\}\) that we construct explicitly. They form a one-parameter family of random continuous spaces ``with holes'' or ``faces'' different from the Brownian sphere. In the so-called dilute phase \(\alpha \in [3/2;2)\), the topology of \(\mathcal\{S\}_\{\alpha\}\) is that of the Sierpinski carpet, while in the dense phase \(\alpha \in (1;3/2)\) the ``faces'' of \(\mathcal\{S\}_\{\alpha\}\) may touch each-others. En route, we prove various geometric properties of these objects concerning their faces or the behavior of geodesics.
