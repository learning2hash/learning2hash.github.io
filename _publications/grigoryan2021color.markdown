In this paper, we discuss possible color palletes, prediction and analysis of
originality of the colors that Artists used on the Renaissance oil paintings.
This framework goal is to help to use the color symbology and image enhancement
tools, to predict the historical color palletes of the Renaissance oil
artworks. This work is only the start of a development to explore the
possibilities of prediction of color palletes of the Renaissance oil artworks.
We believe that framework might be very useful in the prediction of color
palletes of the Renaissance oil artworks and other artworks. The images in
number 105 have been taken from the paintings of three well-known artists,
Rafael, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Rembrandt that are available in the Olga's
Gallery. Images are processed in the frequency domain to enhance a quality of
images and ratios of primary colors are calculated and analyzed by using new
measurements of color-ratios.
