Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been used successfully in recent years
in the area of recommender systems. In this paper we present how this model can
be extended to consider both user ratings and information from Wikipedia. By
mapping items to Wikipedia pages and quantifying their similarity, we are able
to use this information in order to improve recommendation accuracy, especially
when the sparsity is high. Another advantage of the proposed approach is the
fact that it can be easily integrated into any other SVD implementation,
regardless of additional parameters that may have been added to it. Preliminary
experimental results on the MovieLens dataset are encouraging.
