When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from
multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and
protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a
significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new
low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder
adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval
(CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving
pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and
minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning.
  In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization
methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI),
SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of
the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search
accuracy.
