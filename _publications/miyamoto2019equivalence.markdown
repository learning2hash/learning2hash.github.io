The study of tilings is a major problem in many mathematical instances, which
is studied in two main different approaches: when considering the existence (or
obstructions to the existence) of a tiling with a given tile and the other
considering classification of tilings. Considering the Hamming cube
\(\mathbb\{F\}_2^n\), the small tilings, that is, tilings considering tiles with
\(8=2^3\) elements, were classified in \cite\{vardy\}. The authors list a total of
\(193\) different tiles. As the authors noted, many of those tiles can be
obtained one from the other by a linear map. In this work, we are concerned
with a particular class of linear maps, the class of permutations of
coordinates. This is of interest since a permutation is an isometry of the
Hamming cube, considering the Hamming metric. We show here that, up to an
isometry, all those \(193\) tiles can be reduced to \(15\) classes. The proof is
done by explicitly showing the permutation (represented in cycles) that
identify each tile with a given representative.
