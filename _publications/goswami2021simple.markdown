While thermal optical registered datasets are becoming widely available, most
of these works are based on image pairs which are pre-registered. However,
thermal imagers where these images are registered by default are quite
expensive. We present in this work, a thermal image registration technique
which is computationally lightweight, and can be employed regardless of the
resolution of the images captured. We use 2 different thermal imagers to create
a completely new database and introduce it as a part of this work as well. The
images captured are based on 5 different classes and encompass subjects like
the Prayagraj Kumbh Mela, one of the largest public fairs in the world,
captured over a period of 2 years.
