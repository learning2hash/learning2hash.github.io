In this work, we introduce FourieRF, a novel approach for achieving fast and
high-quality reconstruction in the few-shot setting. Our method effectively
parameterizes features through an explicit curriculum training procedure,
incrementally increasing scene complexity during optimization. Experimental
results show that the prior induced by our approach is both robust and
adaptable across a wide variety of scenes, establishing FourieRF as a strong
and versatile baseline for the few-shot rendering problem. While our approach
significantly reduces artifacts, it may still lead to reconstruction errors in
severely under-constrained scenarios, particularly where view occlusion leaves
parts of the shape uncovered. In the future, our method could be enhanced by
integrating foundation models to complete missing parts using large data-driven
priors.
