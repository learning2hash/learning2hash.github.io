Nearest neighbor search methods based on hashing have
attracted considerable attention for effective and efficient
large-scale similarity search in computer vision and information
retrieval community. In this paper, we study the
problems of learning hash functions in the context of multimodal
data for cross-view similarity search. We put forward
a novel hashing method, which is referred to Collective
Matrix Factorization Hashing (CMFH). CMFH learns unified
hash codes by collective matrix factorization with latent
factor model from different modalities of one instance,
which can not only supports cross-view search but also increases
the search accuracy by merging multiple view information
sources. We also prove that CMFH, a similaritypreserving
hashing learning method, has upper and lower
boundaries. Extensive experiments verify that CMFH significantly
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on
three different datasets.
