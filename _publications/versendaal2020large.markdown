We prove large deviations for \(g(t)\)-Brownian motion in a complete, evolving
Riemannian manifold \(M\) with respect to a collection \(\\{g(t)\\}_\{t\in [0,1]\}\) of
Riemannian metrics, smoothly depending on \(t\). We show how the large deviations
are obtained from the large deviations of the (time-dependent) horizontal lift
of \(g(t)\)-Brownian motion to the frame bundle \(FM\) over \(M\). The latter is
proved by embedding the frame bundle into some Euclidean space and applying
Freidlin-Wentzell theory for diffusions with time-dependent coefficients, where
the coefficients are jointly Lipschitz in space and time.
