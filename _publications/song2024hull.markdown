Projective Reed-Muller codes(PRM codes) are constructed from the family of
projective hypersurfaces of a fixed degree over a finite field \(\F_q\). In this
paper, we completely determine the minimal distance of the hull of any
Projective Reed-Muller codes. Motivated by Nathan Kaplan and Jon-Lark Kim
\cite\{kaplankim\},we extend their results and calculate the hulls' dimension of
Projective Reed-Muller Codes in a larger range. We also analyse two special
classes of PRM codes apart from self-dual,self-orthgonal and LCD cases, which
Kaplan and Kim \cite[section 3]\{kaplankim\} didn't consider.
