This working paper describes the Spanish tagset to be used in the context of
CRATER, a CEC funded project aiming at the creation of a multilingual (English,
French, Spanish) aligned corpus using the International Telecommunications
Union corpus. In this respect, each version of the corpus will be (or is
currently) tagged. Xerox PARC tagger will be adapted to Spanish in order to
perform the tagging of the Spanish version. This tagset has been devised as the
ideal one for Spanish, and has been posted to several lists in order to get
feedback to it.
