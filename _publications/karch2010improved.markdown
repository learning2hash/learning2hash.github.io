<p>We engineer an algorithm to solve the approximate dictionary matching
problem. Given a list of words <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span>, maximum distance <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> fixed at preprocessing time and a query
word <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, we would like to retrieve
all words from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span> that can
be transformed into <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> or less edit operations. We present
data structures that support fault tolerant queries by generating an
index. On top of that, we present a generalization of the method that
eases memory consumption and preprocessing time significantly. At the
same time, running times of queries are virtually unaffected. We are
able to match in lists of hundreds of thousands of words and beyond
within microseconds for reasonable distances.</p>
