<p>Many applications in Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access
involve searching large databases of high dimensional data objects with
multiple (conditionally independent) views. In this work we consider the
problem of learning hash functions for similarity search across the
views for such applications. We propose a principled method for learning
a hash function for each view given a set of multiview training data
objects. The hash functions map similar objects to similar codes across
the views thus enabling cross-view similarity search. We present results
from an extensive empirical study of the proposed approach which
demonstrate its effectiveness on Japanese language People Search and
Multilingual People Search problems.</p>
