<p>The expanse of information available over the internet makes it
difficult to identify whether a specific work is a replica or a
duplication of a protected work, especially if we talk about visual
representations. Strategies are planned to identify the utilization of
the copyrighted image in a report. Still, we want to resolve the issue
of involving a copyrighted image in a video and a calculation that could
recognize the degree of similarity of the copyrighted picture utilized
in the video, even for the pieces of the video that are not featured a
lot and in the end perform characterization errands on those edges.
Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are vital to
address this problem. Numerous associations have been creating different
calculations to screen the identification of copyrighted work. This work
means concentrating on those calculations, recognizing designs inside
the information, and fabricating a more reasonable model for copyrighted
image classification and detection. We have used different algorithms
like- Image Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image
hashing, etc. Keywords- Copyright, Artificial Intelligence(AI),
Copyrighted Image, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Image processing,
Degree of similarity, Image Hashing.</p>
