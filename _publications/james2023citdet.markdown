In this letter, we present a new dataset to advance the state of the art in
detecting citrus fruit and accurately estimate yield on trees affected by the
Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in orchard environments via imaging. Despite the
fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection
problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct
comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest
to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work,
particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address
this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in
typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of
citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with
high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees
and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which
contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB
impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box
annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In
summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset
along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object
detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit
location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our
results with yield estimations.
