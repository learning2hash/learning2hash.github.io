According to the Heyde theorem the Gaussian distribution on the real line is
characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear
form of independent random variables given another. We prove an analogue of
this theorem for linear forms of two independent random variables taking values
in an \(a\)-adic solenoid \(\Sigma_a\) without elements of order 2, assuming that
the characteristic functions of the random variables do not vanish, and
coefficients of the linear forms are topological automorphisms of \(\Sigma_a\).
