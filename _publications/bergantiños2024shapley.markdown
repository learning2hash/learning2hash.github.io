We study an index to measure the popularity of artists in music streaming
platforms. This index, which can be used to allocate the amount raised via paid
subscriptions among participating artists, is based on the Shapley value, a
centerpiece in cooperative game theory. We characterize this Shapley index
combining several axioms formalizing principles with normative appeal. This
permits to place the index in the literature, as an alternative to the
well-known (and widely used in the industry) pro-rata and user-centric indices.
