Arbitrary neural style transfer is a vital topic with great research value
and wide industrial application, which strives to render the structure of one
image using the style of another. Recent researches have devoted great efforts
on the task of arbitrary style transfer (AST) for improving the stylization
quality. However, there are very few explorations about the quality evaluation
of AST images, even it can potentially guide the design of different
algorithms. In this paper, we first construct a new AST images quality
assessment database (AST-IQAD), which consists 150 content-style image pairs
and the corresponding 1200 stylized images produced by eight typical AST
algorithms. Then, a subjective study is conducted on our AST-IQAD database,
which obtains the subjective rating scores of all stylized images on the three
subjective evaluations, i.e., content preservation (CP), style resemblance
(SR), and overall vision (OV). To quantitatively measure the quality of AST
image, we propose a new sparse representation-based method, which computes the
quality according to the sparse feature similarity. Experimental results on our
AST-IQAD have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method. The dataset
and source code will be released at
