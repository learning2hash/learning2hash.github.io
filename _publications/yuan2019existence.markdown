Given integers \(k_1, k_2\) with \(0\le k_1<k_2\), the determinations of all
positive integers \(q\) for which there exists a perfect Splitter \(B[-k_1,
k_2](q)\) set is a wide open question in general. In this paper, we obtain new
necessary and sufficient conditions for an odd prime \(p\) such that there exists
a nonsingular perfect \(B[-1,3](p)\) set. We also give some necessary conditions
for the existence of purely singular perfect splitter sets. In particular, we
determine all perfect \(B[-k_1, k_2](2^n)\) sets for any positive integers
\(k_1,k_2\) with \(k_1+k_2\ge4\). We also prove that there are infinitely many
prime \(p\) such that there exists a perfect \(B[-1,3](p)\) set.
