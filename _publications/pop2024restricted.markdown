This article extends the known restricted isometric projection of sparse
datasets in Euclidean spaces \(\mathbb\{R\}^N\) down into low-dimensional subspaces
\(\mathbb\{R\}^k, k \ll N,\) to the case of low-dimensional varieties \(\mathcal\{M\}
\subset \mathbb\{R\}^N,\) of codimension \(N - k = \omega(N)\). Applications to
structured/hierarchical datasets are considered.
