Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated on
large image description datasets. Recently, researchers have started to collect
such datasets for languages other than English. An unexplored question is how
different these datasets are from English and, if there are any differences,
what causes them to differ. This paper provides a cross-linguistic comparison
of Dutch, English, and German image descriptions. We find that these
descriptions are similar in many respects, but the familiarity of crowd workers
with the subjects of the images has a noticeable influence on description
specificity.
