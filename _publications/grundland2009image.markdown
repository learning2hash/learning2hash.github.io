We investigate the use of quasicrystals in image sampling. Quasicrystals
produce space-filling, non-periodic point sets that are uniformly discrete and
relatively dense, thereby ensuring the sample sites are evenly spread out
throughout the sampled image. Their self-similar structure can be attractive
for creating sampling patterns endowed with a decorative symmetry. We present a
brief general overview of the algebraic theory of cut-and-project quasicrystals
based on the geometry of the golden ratio. To assess the practical utility of
quasicrystal sampling, we evaluate the visual effects of a variety of
non-adaptive image sampling strategies on photorealistic image reconstruction
and non-photorealistic image rendering used in multiresolution image
representations. For computer visualization of point sets used in image
sampling, we introduce a mosaic rendering technique.
