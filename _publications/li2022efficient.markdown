In collaborative outlier detection, multiple participants exchange their local detectors trained on decentralized devices without exchanging their own data. A key problem of collaborative outlier detection is efficiently aggregating multiple local detectors to form a global detector without breaching the privacy of participants' data and degrading the detection accuracy. We study locality-sensitive hashing-based ensemble methods to detect collaborative outliers since they are mergeable and compatible with differentially private mechanisms. Our proposed LSH iTables is simple and outperforms recent ensemble competitors on centralized and decentralized scenarios over many real-world data sets.
