Deep learning is popular as an end-to-end framework extracting the prominent
features and performing the classification also. In this paper, we extensively
investigate deep networks as an alternate to feature encoding technique of low
level descriptors for emotion recognition on the benchmark EmoDB dataset.
Fusion performance with such obtained encoded features with other available
features is also investigated. Highest performance to date in the literature is
observed.
