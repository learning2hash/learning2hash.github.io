We study the law of the iterated logarithm (Khinchin (1924), Kolmogorov
(1929)) and related strong invariance principles in stochastic geometry. As
potential applications, we think of well-known functionals such as functionals
defined on the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors graph and important functionals in
topological data analysis such as the Euler characteristic and persistent Betti
numbers.
