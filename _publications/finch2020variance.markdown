We continue an earlier study, starting with unconstrained \(n\)-bitstrings,
focusing now less on average behavior and more on uncertainty. The interplay
between
  \(\bullet\) longest runs of 0s and of 1s, when bitstrings are multus
  \(\bullet\) longest runs of 0s and bitsums (\# of 1s), when bitstrings are solus
  \(\\\) is examined. While negative correlations approach zero as \(n \rightarrow
\infty\) in the former (for clumped 1s), the limit is evidently nonzero in the
latter (for separated 1s). Similar analysis is possible when both 0s and 1s are
clumped (bimultus), and when 0s are clumped but 1s are separated (persolus).
Our methods are experimentally-based.
