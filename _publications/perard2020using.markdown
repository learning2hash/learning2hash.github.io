One of the scalability issues of blockchains is the increase of their sizes
which can prevent users from storing them and thus from contributing to the
decentralization effort. Recent works developed the concept of coded
blockchains, which allow users to store only some coded fragments of the
blockchains. However, this solution is not protected against malicious nodes
that can propagate erroneous coded fragments.
  We propose in the paper to add homomorphic hashes to this system. This allows
for instantaneous detection of erroneous fragments and thus avoids decoding
with wrong data. We describe the integration of this mechanism in coded
blockchains and we evaluate its complexity theoretically and by simulation.
