Reformulating computer vision problems over Riemannian manifolds has
demonstrated superior performance in various computer vision applications. This
is because visual data often forms a special structure lying on a lower
dimensional space embedded in a higher dimensional space. However, since these
manifolds belong to non-Euclidean topological spaces, exploiting their
structures is computationally expensive, especially when one considers the
clustering analysis of massive amounts of data. To this end, we propose an
efficient framework to address the clustering problem on Riemannian manifolds.
This framework implements random projections for manifold points via kernel
space, which can preserve the geometric structure of the original space, but is
computationally efficient. Here, we introduce three methods that follow our
framework. We then validate our framework on several computer vision
applications by comparing against popular clustering methods on Riemannian
manifolds. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework maintains the
performance of the clustering whilst massively reducing computational
complexity by over two orders of magnitude in some cases.
