Many modern multiclass and multilabel problems are characterized by
increasingly large output spaces. For these problems, label embeddings have
been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and
statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank
constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a
fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and
multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm whose running time is
exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We demonstrate our techniques on
two large-scale public datasets, from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text
Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we obtain state of the art
results.
