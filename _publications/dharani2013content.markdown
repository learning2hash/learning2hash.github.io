    Feature means countenance, remote sensing scene objects with similar characteristics, associated to interesting scene elements in the image formation process. They are classified into three types in image processing, that is low, middle and high. Low level features are color, texture and middle level feature is shape and high level feature is semantic gap of objects. An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large image database. Content Based Image Retrieval is a technique which uses visual features of image such as color, shape, texture to search user required image from large image database according to user requests in the form of a query. MKNN is an enhancing method of KNN. The proposed KNN classification is called MKNN. MKNN contains two parts for processing, they are validity of the train samples and applying weighted KNN. The validity of each point is computed according to its neighbors. In our proposal, Modified K-Nearest Neighbor can be considered a kind of weighted KNN so that the query label is approximated by weighting the neighbors of the query.
