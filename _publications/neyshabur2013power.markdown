When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance between short binary hashes we shown that even if the similarity is symmetric we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two distinct code maps. I.e.~by approximating the similarity between x and x as the hamming distance between f(x) and g(x) for two distinct binary codes fg rather than as the hamming distance between f(x) and f(x).
