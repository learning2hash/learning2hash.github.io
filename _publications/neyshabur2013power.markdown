<p>When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance
between short binary hashes, we shown that even if the similarity is
symmetric, we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two
distinct code maps. I.e.~by approximating the similarity between <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> as the hamming distance between
<span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x&#39;)\)</span>, for two distinct binary codes
<span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span>, rather than as the hamming
distance between <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f(x&#39;)\)</span>.</p>
