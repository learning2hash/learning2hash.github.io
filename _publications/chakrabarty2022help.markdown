Recent work in training large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions has opened up exciting opportunities for natural language interface design. Building on the prior success of LLMs in the realm of computer-assisted creativity we aim to study if LLMs can improve the quality of user-generated content through collaboration. We present CoPoet a collaborative poetry writing system. In contrast to auto-completing a users text CoPoet is controlled by user instructions that specify the attributes of the desired text such as Write a sentence about love or Write a sentence ending in fly. The core component of our system is a language model fine-tuned on a diverse collection of instructions for poetry writing. Our model is not only competitive with publicly available LLMs trained on instructions (InstructGPT) but is also capable of satisfying unseen compositional instructions. A study with 15 qualified crowdworkers shows that users successfully write poems with CoPoet on diverse topics ranging from Monarchy to Climate change. Further the collaboratively written poems are preferred by third-party evaluators over those written without the system.
