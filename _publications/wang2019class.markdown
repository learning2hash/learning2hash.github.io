Dictionary learning methods can be split into: i) class specific dictionary
learning ii) class shared dictionary learning. The difference between the two
categories is how to use discriminative information. With the first category,
samples of different classes are mapped into different subspaces, which leads
to some redundancy with the class specific base vectors. While for the second
category, the samples in each specific class can not be described accurately.
In this paper, we first propose a novel class shared dictionary learning method
named label embedded dictionary learning (LEDL). It is the improvement based on
LCKSVD, which is easier to find out the optimal solution. Then we propose a
novel framework named cascaded dictionary learning framework (CDLF) to combine
the specific dictionary learning with shared dictionary learning to describe
the feature to boost the performance of classification sufficiently. Extensive
experimental results on six benchmark datasets illustrate that our methods are
capable of achieving superior performance compared to several state-of-art
classification algorithms.
