Deep learning methods have shown extraordinary potential for analyzing very
diverse biomedical data, but their dissemination beyond developers is hindered
by important computational hurdles. We introduce ImJoy (https://imjoy.io/), a
flexible and open-source browser-based platform designed to facilitate
widespread reuse of deep learning solutions in biomedical research. We
highlight ImJoy's main features and illustrate its functionalities with deep
learning plugins for mobile and interactive image analysis and genomics.
