Twenty-five years ago, morphologically aligned Hebrew-Finnish and
Greek-Finnish bitexts (texts accompanied by a translation) were constructed
manually in order to create an analytical concordance (Luoto et al., 1997) for
a Finnish Bible translation. The creators of the bitexts recently secured the
publisher's permission to release its fine-grained alignment, but the alignment
was still dependent on proprietary, third-party resources such as a copyrighted
text edition and proprietary morphological analyses of the source texts. In
this paper, we describe a nontrivial editorial process starting from the
creation of the original one-purpose database and ending with its
reconstruction using only freely available text editions and annotations. This
process produced an openly available dataset that contains (i) the source texts
and their translations, (ii) the morphological analyses, (iii) the
cross-lingual morpheme alignments.
