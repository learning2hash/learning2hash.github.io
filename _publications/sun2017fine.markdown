Fine-grained categorization can benefit from part-based features which reveal
subtle visual differences between object categories. Handcrafted features have
been widely used for part detection and classification. Although a recent trend
seeks to learn such features automatically using powerful deep learning models
such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), their training and possibly also
testing require manually provided annotations which are costly to obtain. To
relax these requirements, we assume in this study a general problem setting in
which the raw images are only provided with object-level class labels for model
training with no other side information needed. Specifically, by extracting and
interpreting the hierarchical hidden layer features learned by a CNN, we
propose an elaborate CNN-based system for fine-grained categorization. When
evaluated on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, Cars and Stanford
dogs datasets under the setting that only object-level class labels are used
for training and no other annotations are available for both training and
testing, our method achieves impressive performance that is superior or
comparable to the state of the art. Moreover, it sheds some light on ingenious
use of the hierarchical features learned by CNN which has wide applicability
well beyond the current fine-grained categorization task.
