Finding articulated objects like people in pictures present.s a par45; ticularly difficult object. recognition problem. We show how t.o find people by finding putative body segments and then construct.45; ing assemblies of those segments that are consist.ent with the con45; straints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at. least nine segments it is not possible to present every group to a classi45; fier. Instead the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classi45; fier and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.
