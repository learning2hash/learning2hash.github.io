Finding articulated objects like people in pictures present.s a par ticularly difficult object. recognition problem. We show how t.o find people by finding putative body segments and then construct. ing assemblies of those segments that are consist.ent with the con straints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at. least nine segments it is not possible to present every group to a classi fier. Instead the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classi fier and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.
