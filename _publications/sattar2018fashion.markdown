To study the correlation between clothing garments and body shape, we
collected a new dataset (Fashion Takes Shape), which includes images of users
with clothing category annotations. We employ our multi-photo approach to
estimate body shapes of each user and build a conditional model of clothing
categories given body-shape. We demonstrate that in real-world data, clothing
categories and body-shapes are correlated and show that our multi-photo
approach leads to a better predictive model for clothing categories compared to
models based on single-view shape estimates or manually annotated body types.
We see our method as the first step towards the large-scale understanding of
clothing preferences from body shape.
