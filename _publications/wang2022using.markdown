Image-text multimodal representation learning aligns data across modalities
and enables important medical applications, e.g., image classification, visual
grounding, and cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we establish a connection
between multimodal representation learning and multiple instance learning.
Based on this connection, we propose a generic framework for constructing
permutation-invariant score functions with many existing multimodal
representation learning approaches as special cases. Furthermore, we use the
framework to derive a novel contrastive learning approach and demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art results in several downstream tasks.
