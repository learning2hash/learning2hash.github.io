We propose theoretical and empirical improvements for two-stage hashing
methods. We first provide a theoretical analysis on the quality of the binary
codes and show that, under mild assumptions, a residual learning scheme can
construct binary codes that fit any neighborhood structure with arbitrary
accuracy. Secondly, we show that with high-capacity hash functions such as
CNNs, binary code inference can be greatly simplified for many standard
neighborhood definitions, yielding smaller optimization problems and more
robust codes. Incorporating our findings, we propose a novel two-stage hashing
method that significantly outperforms previous hashing studies on widely used
image retrieval benchmarks.
