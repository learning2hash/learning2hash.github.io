In this paper, we study geometric properties of the unique infinite cluster
\(\Gamma\) in a sufficiently supercritical Finitary Random Interlacements
\(\mathcal\{FI\}^\{u,T\}\) in \(\mathbb\{Z\}^d, \ d\ge 3\). We prove that the chemical
distance in \(\Gamma\) is, with stretched exponentially high probability, of the
same order as the Euclidean distance in \(\mathbb\{Z\}^d\). This also implies a
shape theorem parallel to those for Bernoulli percolation and random
interlacements. We also prove local uniqueness of \(\mathcal\{FI\}^\{u,T\}\), which
says any two large clusters in \(\mathcal\{FI\}^\{u,T\}\) "close to each other" will
with stretched exponentially high probability be connected to each other within
the same order of the distance between them.
