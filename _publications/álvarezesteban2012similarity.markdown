We say that two probabilities are similar at level \(\alpha\) if they are
contaminated versions (up to an \(\alpha\) fraction) of the same common
probability. We show how this model is related to minimal distances between
sets of trimmed probabilities. Empirical versions turn out to present an
overfitting effect in the sense that trimming beyond the similarity level
results in trimmed samples that are closer than expected to each other. We show
how this can be combined with a bootstrap approach to assess similarity from
two data samples.
