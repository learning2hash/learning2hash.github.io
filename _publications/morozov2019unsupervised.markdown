We tackle the problem of unsupervised visual descriptors compression which is a key ingredient of large45;scale image retrieval systems. While the deep learning machinery has benefited literally all computer vision pipelines the existing state45;of45;the45;art compression methods employ shallow architectures and we aim to close this gap by our paper. In more detail we introduce a DNN architecture for the unsupervised compressed45;domain retrieval based on multi45;codebook quantization. The proposed architecture is designed to incorporate both fast data encoding and efficient distances computation via lookup tables. We demonstrate the exceptional advantage of our scheme over existing quantization approaches on several datasets of visual descriptors via outperforming the previous state45;of45;the45;art by a large margin.
