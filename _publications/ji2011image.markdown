This report presents the results and details of a content-based image
retrieval project using the Top-surf descriptor. The experimental results are
preliminary, however, it shows the capability of deducing objects from parts of
the objects or from the objects that are similar. This paper uses a dataset
consisting of 1200 images of which 800 images are equally divided into 8
categories, namely airplane, beach, motorbike, forest, elephants, horses, bus
and building, while the other 400 images are randomly picked from the Internet.
The best results achieved are from building category.
