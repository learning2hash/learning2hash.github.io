We consider two families of weighted zero-sum constants for finite abelian
groups. For a finite abelian group \\(( G , + )\\), a set of weights \\(W \subset
\mathbb\{Z\}\\), and an integral parameter \\(m\\), the \\(m\\)-wise Davenport constant
with weights \\(W\\) is the smallest integer \\(n\\) such that each sequence over \\(G\\)
of length \\(n\\) has at least \\(m\\) disjoint zero-subsums with weights \\(W\\). And, for
an integral parameter \\(d\\), the \\(d\\)-constrained Davenport constant with weights
\\(W\\) is the smallest \\(n\\) such that each sequence over \\(G\\) of length \\(n\\) has a
zero-subsum with weights \\(W\\) of size at most \\(d\\). First, we establish a link
between these two types of constants and several basic and general results on
them. Then, for elementary \\(p\\)-groups, establishing a link between our
constants and the parameters of linear codes as well as the cardinality of cap
sets in certain projective spaces, we obtain various explicit results on the
values of these constants.
