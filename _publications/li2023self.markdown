Fact-checking is an essential task in NLP that is commonly utilized for validating the factual accuracy of claims. Prior work has mainly focused on fine-tuning pre-trained languages models on specific datasets which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 researchers are now exploring their in-context learning capabilities for a wide range of tasks. In this paper we aim to assess the capacity of LLMs for fact-checking by introducing Self-Checker a framework comprising a set of plug-and-play modules that facilitate fact-checking by purely prompting LLMs in an almost zero-shot setting. This framework provides a fast and efficient way to construct fact-checking systems in low-resource environments. Empirical results demonstrate the potential of Self-Checker in utilizing LLMs for fact-checking. However there is still significant room for improvement compared to SOTA fine-tuned models which suggests that LLM adoption could be a promising approach for future fact-checking research.
