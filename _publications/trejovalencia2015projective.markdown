We introduce a distance in the space of fully-supported probability measures
on one-dimensional symbolic spaces. We compare this distance to the
\(\bar\{d\}\)-distance and we prove that in general they are not comparable. Our
projective distance is inspired on Hilbert's projective metric, and in the
framework of \(g\)-measures, it allows to assess the continuity of the entropy at
\(g\)-measures satisfying uniqueness. It also allows to relate the speed of
convergence and the regularity of sequences of locally finite \(g\)-functions, to
the preservation at the limit, of certain ergodic properties for the associate
\(g\)-measures.
