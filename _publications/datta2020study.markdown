Consequences from the 2019 anti-extradition protests in Hong Kong have been
studied in many facets, but one topic of interest that has not been explored is
the impact on the immigration of Bangladeshi immigrants into the city. This
paper explores the value add of Bangladeshis to the Hong Kong, how the protests
affected their mentality and consequently their immigration, and potentially
longer-term detrimental effects on the city.
