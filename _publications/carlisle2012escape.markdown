Let \(\\{A, B, C\\}\) be a partition of a sample space \(Î©\). For a random
walk \(S_n = x + \sum_\{j=1\}^n X_j\) starting at \(x \in A\), we find estimates for
the Green's function \(G_\{A \cup B\}(x,y)\) and the hitting time \(E^x(T_C)\) for
\(x, y \in A \cup B\), with interest in the case where \(C\) "separates" \(A\) and
\(B\) in a sense (e.g. the probability of jumping from \(A\) to \(B\), or vice versa,
before hitting \(C\), is small).
