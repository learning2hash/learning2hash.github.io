We study how to evaluate the quantitative information content of a region
within an image for a particular label. To this end, we bridge class activation
maps with information theory. We develop an informative class activation map
(infoCAM). Given a classification task, infoCAM depict how to accumulate
information of partial regions to that of the entire image toward a label.
Thus, we can utilise infoCAM to locate the most informative features for a
label. When applied to an image classification task, infoCAM performs better
than the traditional classification map in the weakly supervised object
localisation task. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Tiny-ImageNet.
