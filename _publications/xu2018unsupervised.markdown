In this paper, we propose a simple but effective semantic-based aggregation
(SBA) method. The proposed SBA utilizes the discriminative filters of deep
convolutional layers as semantic detectors. Moreover, we propose the effective
unsupervised strategy to select some semantic detectors to generate the
"probabilistic proposals", which highlight certain discriminative pattern of
objects and suppress the noise of background. The final global SBA
representation could then be acquired by aggregating the regional
representations weighted by the selected "probabilistic proposals"
corresponding to various semantic content. Our unsupervised SBA is easy to
generalize and achieves excellent performance on various tasks. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and show that our unsupervised SBA outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised aggregation methods on image
retrieval, place recognition and cloud classification.
