Line matching plays an essential role in structure from motion (SFM) and
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), especially in low-textured and
repetitive scenes. In this paper, we present a new method of using a graph
convolution network to match line segments in a pair of images, and we design a
graph-based strategy of matching line segments with relaxing to an optimal
transport problem. In contrast to hand-crafted line matching algorithms, our
approach learns local line segment descriptor and the matching simultaneously
through end-to-end training. The results show our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, and especially, the recall is improved from 45.28%
to 70.47% under a similar presicion. The code of our work is available at
