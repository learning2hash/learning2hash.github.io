Continuous space word embeddings have received a great deal of attention in
the natural language processing and machine learning communities for their
ability to model term similarity and other relationships. We study the use of
term relatedness in the context of query expansion for ad hoc information
retrieval. We demonstrate that word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe, when
trained globally, underperform corpus and query specific embeddings for
retrieval tasks. These results suggest that other tasks benefiting from global
embeddings may also benefit from local embeddings.
