Biographical databases contain diverse information about individuals. Person
names, birth information, career, friends, family and special achievements are
some possible items in the record for an individual. The relationships between
individuals, such as kinship and friendship, provide invaluable insights about
hidden communities which are not directly recorded in databases. We show that
some simple matrix and graph-based operations are effective for inferring
relationships among individuals, and illustrate the main ideas with the China
Biographical Database (CBDB).
