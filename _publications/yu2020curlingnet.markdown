We present an approach named CurlingNet that can measure the semantic
distance of composition of image-text embedding. In order to learn an effective
image-text composition for the data in the fashion domain, our model proposes
two key components as follows. First, the Delivery makes the transition of a
source image in an embedding space. Second, the Sweeping emphasizes
query-related components of fashion images in the embedding space. We utilize a
channel-wise gating mechanism to make it possible. Our single model outperforms
previous state-of-the-art image-text composition models including TIRG and
FiLM. We participate in the first fashion-IQ challenge in ICCV 2019, for which
ensemble of our model achieves one of the best performances.
