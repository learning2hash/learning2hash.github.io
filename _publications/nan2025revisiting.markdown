As artificial intelligence and digital medicine increasingly permeate
healthcare systems, robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure
ethical, secure, and effective implementation. In this context, medical image
retrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a
vital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing
methods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to
produce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive
hashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image
retrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create
positive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or
adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate
knowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the
knowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF)
and Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates
shallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates
image fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings.
These blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based
recommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment.
Moreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and
reproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate
that the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and
significantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval
(p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean
Average Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.
