The present research scholars are having keen interest in doing their
research activities in the area of Data mining all over the world. Especially,
[13]Mining Image data is the one of the essential features in this present
scenario since image data plays vital role in every aspect of the system such
as business for marketing, hospital for surgery, engineering for construction,
Web for publication and so on. The other area in the Image mining system is the
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which performs retrieval based on the
similarity defined in terms of extracted features with more objectiveness. The
drawback in CBIR is the features of the query image alone are considered.
Hence, a new technique called Image retrieval based on optimum clusters is
proposed for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully
exploiting the similarity information. The index is created by describing the
images according to their color characteristics, with compact feature vectors,
that represent typical color distributions [12].
