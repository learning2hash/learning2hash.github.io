We consider the problem of embedding one i.i.d.\ collection of Bernoulli
random variables indexed by \\(\mathbb\{Z\}^d\\) into an independent copy in an
injective \\(M\\)-Lipschitz manner. For the case \\(d=1\\), it was shown by Basu and
Sly (PTRF, 2014) to be possible almost surely for sufficiently large \\(M\\). In
this paper we provide a multi-scale argument extending this result to higher
dimensions.
