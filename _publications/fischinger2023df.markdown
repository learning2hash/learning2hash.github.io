The orchestrated manipulation of public opinion, particularly through
manipulated images, often spread via online social networks (OSN), has become a
serious threat to society. In this paper we introduce the Digital Forensics Net
(DF-Net), a deep neural network for pixel-wise image forgery detection. The
released model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on four established
benchmark datasets. Most notably, DF-Net's detection is robust against lossy
image operations (e.g resizing, compression) as they are automatically
performed by social networks.
