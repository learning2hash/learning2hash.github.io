Understanding the stroke-based evolution of visual artworks is useful for
advancing artwork learning, appreciation, and interactive display. While the
stroke sequence of renowned artworks remains largely unknown, formulating this
sequence for near-natural image drawing processes can significantly enhance our
understanding of artistic techniques. This paper introduces a novel method for
approximating artwork stroke evolution through a proximity-based clustering
mechanism. We first convert pixel images into vector images via parametric
curves and then explore the clustering approach to determine the sequence order
of extracted strokes. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates the potential to
infer stroke sequences in unknown artworks. We evaluate the performance of our
method using WikiArt data and qualitatively demonstrate the plausible stroke
sequences. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to
handle a wide variety of input image types such as line art, face sketches,
paintings, and photographic images. By exploring stroke extraction and sequence
construction, we aim to improve our understanding of the intricacies of the art
development techniques and the step-by-step reconstruction process behind
visual artworks, thereby enriching our understanding of the creative journey
from the initial sketch to the final artwork.
