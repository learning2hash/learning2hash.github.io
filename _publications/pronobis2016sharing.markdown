<p>Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful tool for
sublinear-time approximate nearest neighbor search, and a variety of
hashing schemes have been proposed for different dissimilarity measures.
However, hash codes significantly depend on the dissimilarity, which
prohibits users from adjusting the dissimilarity at query time. In this
paper, we propose {multiple purpose LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash
codes for different dissimilarities. mp-LSH supports L2, cosine, and
inner product dissimilarities, and their corresponding weighted sums,
where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to
modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus, mp-LSH
enables us, for example, to retrieve similar items to a query with the
user preference taken into account, to find a similar material to a
query with some properties (stability, utility, etc.) optimized, and to
turn on or off a part of multi-modal information (brightness, color,
audio, text, etc.) in image/video retrieval. We theoretically and
empirically analyze the performance of three variants of mp-LSH, and
demonstrate their usefulness on real-world data sets.</p>
