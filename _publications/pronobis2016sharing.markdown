Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful tool for sublinear45;time approximate nearest neighbor search and a variety of hashing schemes have been proposed for different dissimilarity measures. However hash codes significantly depend on the dissimilarity which prohibits users from adjusting the dissimilarity at query time. In this paper we propose 123;multiple purpose LSH (mp45;LSH) which shares the hash codes for different dissimilarities. mp45;LSH supports L2 cosine and inner product dissimilarities and their corresponding weighted sums where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to modify the importance of pre45;defined groups of features. Thus mp45;LSH enables us for example to retrieve similar items to a query with the user preference taken into account to find a similar material to a query with some properties (stability utility etc.) optimized and to turn on or off a part of multi45;modal information (brightness color audio text etc.) in image/video retrieval. We theoretically and empirically analyze the performance of three variants of mp45;LSH and demonstrate their usefulness on real45;world data sets.
