In 1984, Johnson and Lindenstrauss proved that any finite set of data in a
high-dimensional space can be projected to a lower-dimensional space while
preserving the pairwise Euclidean distance between points up to a bounded
relative error. If the desired dimension of the image is too small, however,
Kane, Meka, and Nelson (2011) and Jayram and Woodruff (2013) independently
proved that such a projection does not exist. In this paper, we provide a
precise asymptotic threshold for the dimension of the image, above which, there
exists a projection preserving the Euclidean distance, but, below which, there
does not exist such a projection.
