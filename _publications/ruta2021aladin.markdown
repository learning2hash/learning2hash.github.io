We present ALADIN (All Layer AdaIN); a novel architecture for searching
images based on the similarity of their artistic style. Representation learning
is critical to visual search, where distance in the learned search embedding
reflects image similarity. Learning an embedding that discriminates
fine-grained variations in style is hard, due to the difficulty of defining and
labelling style. ALADIN takes a weakly supervised approach to learning a
representation for fine-grained style similarity of digital artworks,
leveraging BAM-FG, a novel large-scale dataset of user generated content
groupings gathered from the web. ALADIN sets a new state of the art accuracy
for style-based visual search over both coarse labelled style data (BAM) and
BAM-FG; a new 2.62 million image dataset of 310,000 fine-grained style
groupings also contributed by this work.
