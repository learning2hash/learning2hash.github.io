We present ALADIN (All Layer AdaIN); a novel architecture for searching images
based on the similarity of their artistic style. Representation learning is
critical to visual search, where distance in the learned search embedding
reflects image similarity. Learning an embedding that discriminates fine-grained
variations in style is hard, due to the difficulty of defining and labelling
style. ALADIN takes a weakly supervised approach to learning a representation
for fine-grained style similarity of digital artworks, leveraging BAM-FG, a
novel large-scale dataset of user generated content groupings gathered from the
web. ALADIN sets a new state of the art accuracy for style-based visual search
over both coarse labelled style data (BAM) and BAM-FG; a new 2.62 million image
dataset of 310,000 fine-grained style groupings also contributed by this work.
