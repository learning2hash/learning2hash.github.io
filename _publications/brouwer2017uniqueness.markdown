For (ndw in ) let (A(ndw)) denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length (n) minimum distance (d) and constant weight (w). Schrijver recently showed using semidefinite programming that (A(23811)=1288) and the second author that (A(22811)=672) and (A(22810)=616). Here we show uniqueness of the codes achieving these bounds. Let (A(nd)) denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length (n) and minimum distance (d). Gijswijt Mittelmann and Schrijver showed that (A(208)=256). We show that there are several nonisomorphic codes achieving this bound and classify all such codes with all distances divisible by 4.
