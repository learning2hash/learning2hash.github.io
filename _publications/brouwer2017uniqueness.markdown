For \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n,d,w \in \mathbb\{N\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(n,d,w)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, minimum distance \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and constant weight \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Schrijver recently showed using semidefinite programming that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(23,8,11)=1288\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, and the second author that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(22,8,11)=672\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(22,8,10)=616\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Here we show uniqueness of the codes achieving these bounds. Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(n,d)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and minimum distance \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Gijswijt, Mittelmann and Schrijver showed that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(20,8)=256\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We show that there are several nonisomorphic codes achieving this bound, and classify all such codes with all distances divisible by 4.
