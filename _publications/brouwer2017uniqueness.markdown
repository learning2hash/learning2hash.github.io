For \\(n,d,w \in \mathbb\{N\}\\), let \\(A(n,d,w)\\) denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length \\(n\\), minimum distance \\(d\\) and constant weight \\(w\\). Schrijver recently showed using semidefinite programming that \\(A(23,8,11)=1288\\), and the second author that \\(A(22,8,11)=672\\) and \\(A(22,8,10)=616\\). Here we show uniqueness of the codes achieving these bounds. Let \\(A(n,d)\\) denote the maximum size of a binary code of word length \\(n\\) and minimum distance \\(d\\). Gijswijt, Mittelmann and Schrijver showed that \\(A(20,8)=256\\). We show that there are several nonisomorphic codes achieving this bound, and classify all such codes with all distances divisible by 4.
