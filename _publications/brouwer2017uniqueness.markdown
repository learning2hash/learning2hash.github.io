<p>For <span class="math inline">\(n,d,w \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, let
<span class="math inline">\(A(n,d,w)\)</span> denote the maximum size of
a binary code of word length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
minimum distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and constant
weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Schrijver recently showed
using semidefinite programming that <span
class="math inline">\(A(23,8,11)=1288\)</span>, and the second author
that <span class="math inline">\(A(22,8,11)=672\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A(22,8,10)=616\)</span>. Here we show uniqueness
of the codes achieving these bounds. Let <span
class="math inline">\(A(n,d)\)</span> denote the maximum size of a
binary code of word length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and
minimum distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Gijswijt,
Mittelmann and Schrijver showed that <span
class="math inline">\(A(20,8)=256\)</span>. We show that there are
several nonisomorphic codes achieving this bound, and classify all such
codes with all distances divisible by 4.</p>
