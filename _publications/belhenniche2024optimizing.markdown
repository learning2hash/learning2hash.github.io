This article provides a new approach on how to enhance data storage and
retrieval in the Query By Image Content Systems (QBIC) by introducing the \\(\{\rm
NEM\}_\{\sigma\}\\) distance measure, satisfying the relaxed triangle inequality. By
leveraging the concept of extended \\(b\\)-metric spaces, we address complex
distance relationships, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of image
database management. The use of \\(\{\rm NEM\}_\{\sigma\}\\) facilitates better
scalability and accuracy in large-scale image retrieval systems, optimizing
both the storage and retrieval processes. The proposed method represents a
significant advancement over traditional distance measures, offering enhanced
flexibility and precision in the context of image content-based querying.
Additionally, we take inspiration from ice flow models using \\(\{\rm
NEM\}_\{\sigma\}\\) and \\(\{\rm NEM\}_r\\), adding dynamic and location-based factors to
better capture details in images.
