Similar product recommendation is one of the most common scenes in
e-commerce. Many recommendation algorithms such as item-to-item Collaborative
Filtering are working on measuring item similarities. In this paper, we
introduce our real-time personalized algorithm to model product similarity and
real-time user interests. We also introduce several other baseline algorithms
including an image-similarity-based method, item-to-item collaborative
filtering, and item2vec, and compare them on our large-scale real-world
e-commerce dataset. The algorithms which achieve good offline results are also
tested on the online e-commerce website. Our personalized method achieves a 10%
improvement on the add-cart number in the real-world e-commerce scenario.
