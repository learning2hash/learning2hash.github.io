Let \\(X\\) be a \\(d\\)-dimensional random vector and \\(X_\theta\\) its projection onto
the span of a set of orthonormal vectors \\(\\{\theta_1,...,\theta_k\\}\\).
Conditions on the distribution of \\(X\\) are given such that if \\(\theta\\) is chosen
according to Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold, the bounded-Lipschitz
distance from \\(X_\theta\\) to a Gaussian distribution is concentrated at its
expectation; furthermore, an explicit bound is given for the expected distance,
in terms of \\(d\\), \\(k\\), and the distribution of \\(X\\), allowing consideration not
just of fixed \\(k\\) but of \\(k\\) growing with \\(d\\). The results are applied in the
setting of projection pursuit, showing that most \\(k\\)-dimensional projections of
\\(n\\) data points in \\(\R^d\\) are close to Gaussian, when \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) are large and
\\(k=c\sqrt\{log(d)\}\\) for a small constant \\(c\\).
