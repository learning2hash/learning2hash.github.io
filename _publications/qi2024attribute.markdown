Detecting objects of interest through language often presents challenges,
particularly with objects that are uncommon or complex to describe, due to
perceptual discrepancies between automated models and human annotators. These
challenges highlight the need for comprehensive datasets that go beyond
standard object labels by incorporating detailed attribute descriptions. To
address this need, we introduce the Objects365-Attr dataset, an extension of
the existing Objects365 dataset, distinguished by its attribute annotations.
This dataset reduces inconsistencies in object detection by integrating a broad
spectrum of attributes, including color, material, state, texture and tone. It
contains an extensive collection of 5.6M object-level attribute descriptions,
meticulously annotated across 1.4M bounding boxes. Additionally, to validate
the dataset's effectiveness, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of YOLO-World at
different scales, measuring their detection performance and demonstrating the
dataset's contribution to advancing object detection.
