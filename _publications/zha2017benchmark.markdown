Sparse coding has achieved a great success in various image processing tasks.
However, a benchmark to measure the sparsity of image patch/group is missing
since sparse coding is essentially an NP-hard problem. This work attempts to
fill the gap from the perspective of rank minimization. More details please see
the manuscript....
