A major challenge of recommender systems is to help users locating
interesting items. Personalized recommender systems have become very popular as
they attempt to predetermine the needs of users and provide them with
recommendations to personalize their navigation. However, few studies have
addressed the question of what drives the users' attention to specific content
within the collection and what influences the selection of interesting items.
To this end, we employ the lens of Information Foraging Theory (IFT) to image
recommendation to demonstrate how the user could utilize visual bookmarks to
locate interesting images. We investigate a personalized content-based image
recommendation system to understand what affects user attention by reinforcing
visual attention cues based on IFT. We further find that visual bookmarks
(cues) lead to a stronger scent of the recommended image collection. Our
evaluation is based on the Pinterest image collection.
