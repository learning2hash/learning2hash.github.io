Bilinear models has been shown to achieve impressive performance on a wide
range of visual tasks, such as semantic segmentation, fine grained recognition
and face recognition. However, bilinear features are high dimensional,
typically on the order of hundreds of thousands to a few million, which makes
them impractical for subsequent analysis. We propose two compact bilinear
representations with the same discriminative power as the full bilinear
representation but with only a few thousand dimensions. Our compact
representations allow back-propagation of classification errors enabling an
end-to-end optimization of the visual recognition system. The compact bilinear
representations are derived through a novel kernelized analysis of bilinear
pooling which provide insights into the discriminative power of bilinear
pooling, and a platform for further research in compact pooling methods.
Experimentation illustrate the utility of the proposed representations for
image classification and few-shot learning across several datasets.
