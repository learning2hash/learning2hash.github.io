Nowadays deep learning models are widely adopted in web45;scale applications such as recommender systems and online advertising. In these applications embedding learning of categorical features is crucial to the success of deep learning models. In these models a standard method is that each categorical feature value is assigned a unique embedding vector which can be learned and optimized. Although this method can well capture the characteristics of the categorical features and promise good performance it can incur a huge memory cost to store the embedding table especially for those web45;scale applications. Such a huge memory cost significantly holds back the effectiveness and usability of EDRMs. In this paper we propose a binary code based hash embedding method which allows the size of the embedding table to be reduced in arbitrary scale without compromising too much performance. Experimental evaluation results show that one can still achieve 9937; performance even if the embedding table size is reduced 1000Ã— smaller than the original one with our proposed method.
