The paper describes a method for measuring the similarity and symmetry of an
image annotated with bounding boxes indicating image objects. The latter
representation became popular recently due to the rapid development of fast and
efficient deep-learning-based object-detection methods. The proposed approach
allows for comparing sets of bounding boxes to estimate the degree of
similarity of their underlying images. It is based on the fuzzy approach that
uses the fuzzy mutual position (FMP) matrix to describe spatial composition and
relations between bounding boxes within an image. A method of computing the
similarity of two images described by their FMP matrices is proposed and the
algorithm of its computation. It outputs the single scalar value describing the
degree of content-based image similarity. By modifying the method`s parameters,
instead of similarity, the reflectional symmetry of object composition may also
be measured. The proposed approach allows for measuring differences in objects`
composition of various intensities. It is also invariant to translation and
scaling and - in case of symmetry detection - position and orientation of the
symmetry axis. A couple of examples illustrate the method.
