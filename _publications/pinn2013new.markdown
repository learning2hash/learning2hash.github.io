Digital multimedia watermarking technology was suggested in the last decade
to embed copyright information in digital objects such images, audio and video.
However, the increasing use of relational database systems in many real-life
applications created an ever increasing need for watermarking database systems.
As a result, watermarking relational database systems is now merging as a
research area that deals with the legal issue of copyright protection of
database systems. Approach: In this study, we proposed an efficient database
watermarking algorithm based on inserting binary image watermarks in
non-numeric mutli-word attributes of selected database tuples. Results: The
algorithm is robust as it resists attempts to remove or degrade the embedded
watermark and it is blind as it does not require the original database in order
to extract the embedded watermark. Conclusion: Experimental results
demonstrated blindness and the robustness of the algorithm against common
database attacks.
