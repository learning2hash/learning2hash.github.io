Microsoft Turing-ANNS-1B is a new dataset being released by the Microsoft Turing team for this competition. It consists of Bing queries encoded by Turing AGI v5 that trains Transformers to capture similarity of intent in web search queries. An early version of the RNN-based AGI Encoder is described in a SIGIR'19 paper and a blogpost.
