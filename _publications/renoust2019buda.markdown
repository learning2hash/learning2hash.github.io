We introduce BUDA.ART, a system designed to assist researchers in Art
History, to explore and analyze an archive of pictures of Buddha statues. The
system combines different CBIR and classical retrieval techniques to assemble
2D pictures, 3D statue scans and meta-data, that is focused on the Buddha
facial characteristics. We build the system from an archive of 50,000 Buddhism
pictures, identify unique Buddha statues, extract contextual information, and
provide specific facial embedding to first index the archive. The system allows
for mobile, on-site search, and to explore similarities of statues in the
archive. In addition, we provide search visualization and 3D analysis of the
statues
