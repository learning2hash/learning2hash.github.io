In this paper, we examine the binary linear codes with respect to Hamming
metric from incidence matrix of a unit graph \\(G(\mathbb\{Z\}_\{n\})\\) with vertex
set is \\(\mathbb\{Z\}_\{n\}\\) and two distinct vertices \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being adjacent if
and only if \\(x+y\\) is unit. The main parameters of the codes are given.
