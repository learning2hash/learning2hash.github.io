Existing unsupervised hash learning is a kind of attribute45;centered calculation. It may not accurately preserve the similarity between data. This leads to low down the performance of hash function learning. In this paper a hash algorithm is proposed with a hyper45;class representation. It is a two45;steps approach. The first step finds potential decision features and establish hyper45;class. The second step constructs hash learning based on the hyper45;class information in the first step so that the hash codes of the data within the hyper45;class are as similar as possible as well as the hash codes of the data between the hyper45;classes are as different as possible. To evaluate the efficiency a series of experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed hash algorithm is more efficient than the compared algorithms in terms of mean average precision (MAP) average precision (AP) and Hamming radius 2 (HAM2)
