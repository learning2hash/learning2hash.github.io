This paper uncovers a large class of left-invariant sub-Rie\-mannian systems
on Lie groups that admit explicit solutions with certain properties, and
provides geometric origins for a class of important curves on Stiefel
manifolds, called quasi-geodesics, that project on Grassmann manifolds as
Riemannian geodesics. We show that quasi-geodesics are the projections of
sub-Riemannian geodesics generated by certain left-invariant distributions on
Lie groups that act transitively on each Stiefel manifold \\(St_k^n(V)\\). This
result is valid not only for the real Stiefel manifolds in \\(V=\mathbb R^n\\), but
also for the Stiefels in the Hermitian space \\(V=\mathbb C^n\\) and the quaternion
space \\(V=\mathbb H^n\\).
