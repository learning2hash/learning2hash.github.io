We developed NameMyGene, a web tool and a stand alone program to easily
generate putative family-based names for small RNA sequences so that
laboratories can easily organize, analyze, and observe patterns from, the
massive amount of data generated by next-generation sequencers. NameMyGene,
also applicable to other emerging methods such as RNA-Seq, and Chip-Seq, solely
uses the input small RNA sequence and does not require any additional data such
as other sequence data sets. The web server and software is freely available
(http://www.johnlab.org/NameMyGene) and is based on Java to ensure platform
independency.
