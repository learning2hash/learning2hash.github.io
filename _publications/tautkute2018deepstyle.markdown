In this paper, we propose a multimodal search engine that combines visual and
textual cues to retrieve items from a multimedia database aesthetically similar
to the query. The goal of our engine is to enable intuitive retrieval of
fashion merchandise such as clothes or furniture. Existing search engines treat
textual input only as an additional source of information about the query image
and do not correspond to the real-life scenario where the user looks for 'the
same shirt but of denim'. Our novel method, dubbed DeepStyle, mitigates those
shortcomings by using a joint neural network architecture to model contextual
dependencies between features of different modalities. We prove the robustness
of this approach on two different challenging datasets of fashion items and
furniture where our DeepStyle engine outperforms baseline methods by 18-21% on
the tested datasets. Our search engine is commercially deployed and available
through a Web-based application.
