A well-known conjecture of Gilbreath, and independently Proth from the 1800s,
states that if \(a_\{0,n\} = p_n\) denotes the \(n^\{\text\{th\}\}\) prime number and
\(a_\{i,n\} = |a_\{i-1,n\}-a_\{i-1,n+1\}|\) for \(i, n \ge 1\), then \(a_\{i,1\} = 1\) for
all \(i \ge 1\). It has been postulated repeatedly that the property of having
\(a_\{i,1\} = 1\) for \(i\) large enough should hold for any choice of initial
\((a_\{0,n\})_\{n \ge 1\}\) provided that the gaps \(a_\{0,n+1\}-a_\{0,n\}\) are not too
large and are sufficiently random. We prove (a precise form of) this postulate.
