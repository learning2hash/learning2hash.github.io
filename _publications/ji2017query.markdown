Given the explosive growth of online videos, it is becoming increasingly
important to relieve the tedious work of browsing and managing the video
content of interest. Video summarization aims at providing such a technique by
transforming one or multiple videos into a compact one. However, conventional
multi-video summarization methods often fail to produce satisfying results as
they ignore the user's search intent. To this end, this paper proposes a novel
query-aware approach by formulating the multi-video summarization in a sparse
coding framework, where the web images searched by the query are taken as the
important preference information to reveal the query intent. To provide a
user-friendly summarization, this paper also develops an event-keyframe
presentation structure to present keyframes in groups of specific events
related to the query by using an unsupervised multi-graph fusion method. We
release a new public dataset named MVS1K, which contains about 1, 000 videos
from 10 queries and their video tags, manual annotations, and associated web
images. Extensive experiments on MVS1K dataset validate our approaches produce
superior objective and subjective results against several recently proposed
approaches.
