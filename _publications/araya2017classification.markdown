In this note, we study the classification of \(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-codes. For some
special cases \((k_1,k_2)\), by hand, we give a classification of
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-codes of length \(n\) and type \(4^\{k_1\}2^\{k_2\}\) satisfying a
certain condition. Our exhaustive computer search completes the classification
of \(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-codes of lengths up to \(7\).
