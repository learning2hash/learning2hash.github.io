Masader (Alyafeai et al., 2021) created a metadata structure to be used for
cataloguing Arabic NLP datasets. However, developing an easy way to explore
such a catalogue is a challenging task. In order to give the optimal experience
for users and researchers exploring the catalogue, several design and user
experience challenges must be resolved. Furthermore, user interactions with the
website may provide an easy approach to improve the catalogue. In this paper,
we introduce Masader Plus, a web interface for users to browse Masader. We
demonstrate data exploration, filtration, and a simple API that allows users to
examine datasets from the backend. Masader Plus can be explored using this link
https://arbml.github.io/masader. A video recording explaining the interface can
