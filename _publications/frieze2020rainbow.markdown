Let \(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n\) be chosen independently and uniformly at random from
the unit \(d\)-dimensional cube \([0,1]^d\). Let \(r\) be given and let \(\cal
X=\\{X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n\\}\). The random geometric graph \(G=G_\{\cal X,r\}\) has
vertex set \(\cal X\) and an edge \(X_iX_j\) whenever \(\|X_i-X_j\|\leq r\). We show
that if each edge of \(G\) is colored independently from one of \(n+o(n)\) colors
and \(r\) has the smallest value such that \(G\) has minimum degree at least two,
then \(G\) contains a rainbow Hamilton cycle a.a.s.
