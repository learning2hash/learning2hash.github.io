In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for
annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and
contemporary French literature. We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate
that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively,
although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors.
Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable
of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by
literary authors. However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately
identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval
engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that
raises significant ethical concerns. Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs
remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially
for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale
through manual methods alone.
