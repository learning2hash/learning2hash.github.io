We introduce the AVECL-UMons dataset for audio-visual event classification
and localization in the context of office environments. The audio-visual
dataset is composed of 11 event classes recorded at several realistic positions
in two different rooms. Two types of sequences are recorded according to the
number of events in the sequence. The dataset comprises 2662 unilabel sequences
and 2724 multilabel sequences corresponding to a total of 5.24 hours. The
dataset is publicly accessible online :
