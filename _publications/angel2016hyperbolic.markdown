We show that for infinite planar unimodular random rooted maps, many global
geometric and probabilistic properties are equivalent, and are determined by a
natural, local notion of average curvature. This dichotomy includes properties
relating to amenability, conformal geometry, random walks, uniform and minimal
spanning forests, and Bernoulli bond percolation. We also prove that every
simply connected unimodular random rooted map is sofic, that is, a
Benjamini-Schramm limit of finite maps.
