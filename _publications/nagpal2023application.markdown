Tree fruit breeding is a long-term activity involving repeated measurements
of various fruit quality traits on a large number of samples. These traits are
traditionally measured by manually counting the fruits, weighing to indirectly
measure the fruit size, and fruit colour is classified subjectively into
different color categories using visual comparison to colour charts. These
processes are slow, expensive and subject to evaluators' bias and fatigue.
Recent advancements in deep learning can help automate this process. A method
was developed to automatically count the number of sweet cherry fruits in a
camera's field of view in real time using YOLOv3. A system capable of analyzing
the image data for other traits such as size and color was also developed using
Python. The YOLO model obtained close to 99% accuracy in object detection and
counting of cherries and 90% on the Intersection over Union metric for object
localization when extracting size and colour information. The model surpasses
human performance and offers a significant improvement compared to manual
counting.
