LinkedIn search is deeply personalized - for the same queries, different
searchers expect completely different results. This paper presents our approach
to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer
searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending
the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many
aspects. Then, learning-to-rank (LTR) is applied to combine these signals with
standard search features.
