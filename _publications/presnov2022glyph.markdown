Metaphoric glyphs enhance the readability and learnability of abstract glyphs
used for the visualization of quantitative multidimensional data by building
upon graphical entities that are intuitively related to the underlying problem
domain. Their construction is, however, a predominantly manual process. In this
paper, we introduce the Glyph-from-Icon (GfI) approach that allows the
automated generation of metaphoric glyphs from user specified icons. Our
approach modifies the icon's visual appearance using up to seven quantifiable
visual variables, three of which manipulate its geometry while four affect its
color. Depending on the visualization goal, specific combinations of these
visual variables define the glyphs's variables used for data encoding.
Technically, we propose a diffusion-curve based parametric icon representation,
which comprises the degrees-of-freedom related to the geometric and color-based
visual variables. Moreover, we extend our GfI approach to achieve scalability
of the generated glyphs. Based on a user study we evaluate the perception of
the glyph's main variables, i.e., amplitude and frequency of geometric and
color modulation, as function of the stimuli and deduce functional relations as
well as quantization levels to achieve perceptual monotonicity and readability.
Finally, we propose a robustly perceivable combination of visual variables,
which we apply to the visualization of COVID-19 data.
