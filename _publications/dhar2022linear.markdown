We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_\infty\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} sense. More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb\{F\}\_q^n\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( and a randomly chosen linear map \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}L : \mathbb\{F\}\_q^n \to \mathbb\{F\}\_q^t\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( with \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}q^t\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( taken to be sufficiently smaller than \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} |S|$. Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(U\_S\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} denote a random variable distributed uniformly on \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(S\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(L\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, the random variable \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(L(U\_S)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is close to uniform in the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_\infty\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} norm. In other words, \{\em every\} element in the range \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbb\{F\}\_q^t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} has about the same number of elements in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(S\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, distance (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions [ADMPT99]. By known bounds from the load balancing literature [RS98], our results are tight and show that linear functions hash as well as trully random function up to a constant factor in the entropy loss. Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.
