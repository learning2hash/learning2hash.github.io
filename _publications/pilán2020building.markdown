We present a large Norwegian lexical resource of categorized medical terms.
The resource merges information from large medical databases, and contains over
77,000 unique entries, including automatically mapped terms from a Norwegian
medical dictionary. We describe the methodology behind this automatic
dictionary entry mapping based on keywords and suffixes and further present the
results of a manual evaluation performed on a subset by a domain expert. The
evaluation indicated that ca. 80% of the mappings were correct.
