In this note, we show that one can use average embeddings, introduced recently in [Naor'20, arXiv:1905.01280], to obtain efficient algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search. In particular, a metric \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} embeds into \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} on average, with distortion \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(D\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, if, for any distribution \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mu\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} on \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, the embedding is \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(D\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} Lipschitz and the (square of) distance does not decrease on average (wrt \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mu\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}). In particular existence of such an embedding (assuming it is efficient) implies a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(D^3)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} approximate nearest neighbor search under \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. This can be seen as a strengthening of the classic (bi-Lipschitz) embedding approach to nearest neighbor search, and is another application of data-dependent hashing paradigm.
