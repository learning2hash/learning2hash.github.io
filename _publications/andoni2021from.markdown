<p>In this note, we show that one can use average embeddings, introduced
recently in [Naorâ€™20, arXiv:1905.01280], to obtain efficient algorithms
for approximate nearest neighbor search. In particular, a metric <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> embeds into <span
class="math inline">\(\ell_2\)</span> on average, with distortion <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, if, for any distribution <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the embedding is <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> Lipschitz and the (square of) distance
does not decrease on average (wrt <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>). In particular existence of such an
embedding (assuming it is efficient) implies a <span
class="math inline">\(O(D^3)\)</span> approximate nearest neighbor
search under <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This can be seen as
a strengthening of the classic (bi-Lipschitz) embedding approach to
nearest neighbor search, and is another application of data-dependent
hashing paradigm.</p>
