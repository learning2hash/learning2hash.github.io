Distances on symbolic musical sequences are needed for a variety of
applications, from music retrieval to automatic music generation. These musical
sequences belong to a given corpus (or style) and it is obvious that a good
distance on musical sequences should take this information into account; being
able to define a distance ex nihilo which could be applicable to all music
styles seems implausible. A distance could also be invariant under some
transformations, such as transpositions, so that it can be used as a distance
between musical motives rather than musical sequences. However, to our
knowledge, none of the approaches to devise musical distances seem to address
these issues. This paper introduces a method to build transposition-invariant
distances on symbolic musical sequences which are learned from data. It is a
hybrid distance which combines learned feature representations of musical
sequences with a handcrafted rank distance. This distance depends less on the
musical encoding of the data than previous methods and gives perceptually good
results. We demonstrate its efficiency on the dataset of chorale melodies by
J.S. Bach.
