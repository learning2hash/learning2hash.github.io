We present a new similarity measure based on information theoretic measures
which is superior than Normalized Compression Distance for clustering problems
and inherits the useful properties of conditional Kolmogorov complexity. We
show that Normalized Compression Dictionary Size and Normalized Compression
Dictionary Entropy are computationally more efficient, as the need to perform
the compression itself is eliminated. Also they scale linearly with exponential
vector size growth and are content independent. We show that normalized
compression dictionary distance is compressor independent, if limited to
lossless compressors, which gives space for optimizations and implementation
speed improvement for real-time and big data applications. The introduced
measure is applicable for machine learning tasks of parameter-free unsupervised
clustering, supervised learning such as classification and regression, feature
selection, and is applicable for big data problems with order of magnitude
speed increase.
