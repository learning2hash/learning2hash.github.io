Reasoning-based approaches have demonstrated their powerful ability for the
task of image-text matching. In this work, two issues are addressed for
image-text matching. First, for reasoning processing, conventional approaches
have no ability to find and use multi-level hierarchical similarity
information. To solve this problem, a hierarchical similarity reasoning module
is proposed to automatically extract context information, which is then
co-exploited with local interaction information for efficient reasoning.
Second, previous approaches only consider learning single-stream similarity
alignment (i.e., image-to-text level or text-to-image level), which is
inadequate to fully use similarity information for image-text matching. To
address this issue, a two-stream architecture is developed to decompose
image-text matching into image-to-text level and text-to-image level similarity
computation. These two issues are investigated by a unifying framework that is
trained in an end-to-end manner, namely two-stream hierarchical similarity
reasoning network. The extensive experiments performed on the two benchmark
datasets of MSCOCO and Flickr30K show the superiority of the proposed approach
as compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
