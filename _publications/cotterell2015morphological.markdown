Linguistic similarity is multi-faceted. For instance, two words may be
similar with respect to semantics, syntax, or morphology inter alia. Continuous
word-embeddings have been shown to capture most of these shades of similarity
to some degree. This work considers guiding word-embeddings with
morphologically annotated data, a form of semi-supervised learning, encouraging
the vectors to encode a word's morphology, i.e., words close in the embedded
space share morphological features. We extend the log-bilinear model to this
end and show that indeed our learned embeddings achieve this, using German as a
case study.
