<p>Authenticated data structures provide cryptographic proofs that their
answers are as accurate as the author intended, even if the data
structure is being controlled by a remote untrusted host. We present
efficient techniques for authenticating data structures that represent
graphs and collections of geometric objects. We introduce the path hash
accumulator, a new primitive based on cryptographic hashing for
efficiently authenticating various properties of structured data
represented as paths, including any decomposable query over sequences of
elements. We show how to employ our primitive to authenticate queries
about properties of paths in graphs and search queries on
multi-catalogs. This allows the design of new, efficient authenticated
data structures for fundamental problems on networks, such as path and
connectivity queries over graphs, and complex queries on two-dimensional
geometric objects, such as intersection and containment queries.</p>
