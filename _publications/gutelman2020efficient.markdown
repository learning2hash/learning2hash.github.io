Image galleries provide a rich source of diverse information about a product
which can be leveraged across many recommendation and retrieval applications.
We study the problem of building a universal image gallery encoder through
multi-task learning (MTL) approach and demonstrate that it is indeed a
practical way to achieve generalizability of learned representations to new
downstream tasks. Additionally, we analyze the relative predictive performance
of MTL-trained solutions against optimal and substantially more expensive
solutions, and find signals that MTL can be a useful mechanism to address
sparsity in low-resource binary tasks.
