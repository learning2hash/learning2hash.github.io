Many high dimensional vector distances tend to a constant. This is typically
considered a negative "contrast-loss" phenomenon that hinders clustering and
other machine learning techniques. We reinterpret "contrast-loss" as a
blessing. Re-deriving "contrast-loss" using the law of large numbers, we show
it results in a distribution's instances concentrating on a thin "hyper-shell".
The hollow center means apparently chaotically overlapping distributions are
actually intrinsically separable. We use this to develop
distribution-clustering, an elegant algorithm for grouping of data points by
their (unknown) underlying distribution. Distribution-clustering, creates
notably clean clusters from raw unlabeled data, estimates the number of
clusters for itself and is inherently robust to "outliers" which form their own
clusters. This enables trawling for patterns in unorganized data and may be the
key to enabling machine intelligence.
