Motivated by applications in DNA-based storage, we study explicit encoding
and decoding schemes of binary strings satisfying locally balanced constraints,
where the \((\ell,\delta)\)-locally balanced constraint requires that the weight
of any consecutive substring of length \(\ell\) is between
\(\frac\{\ell\}\{2\}-\delta\) and \(\frac\{\ell\}\{2\}+\delta\). In this paper we present
coding schemes for the strongly locally balanced constraints and the locally
balanced constraints, respectively. Moreover, we introduce an additional result
on the linear recurrence formula of the number of binary strings which are
\((6,1)\)-locally balanced, as a further attempt to both capacity
characterization and new coding strategies for locally balanced constraints.
