New properties of \(q\)-ary cyclotomic cosets modulo \(n = q^\{m\} - 1\), where \(q
\geq 3\) is a prime power, are investigated in this paper. Based on these
properties, the dimension as well as bounds for the designed distance of some
families of classical cyclic codes can be computed. As an application, new
families of nonbinary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum codes as well as new
families of convolutional codes are constructed in this work. These new CSS
codes have parameters better than the ones available in the literature. The
convolutional codes constructed here have free distance greater than the ones
available in the literature.
