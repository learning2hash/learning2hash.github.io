In this paper, we propose a method for density-based clustering in
high-dimensional spaces that combines Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with the
Quick Shift algorithm. The Quick Shift algorithm, known for its hierarchical
clustering capabilities, is extended by integrating approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) using LSH to provide efficient density estimates. The proposed
approach achieves almost linear time complexity while preserving the
consistency of density-based clustering.
