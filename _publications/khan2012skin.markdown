On dedicated websites, people can upload videos and share it with the rest of
the world. Currently these videos are cat- egorized manually by the help of the
user community. In this paper, we propose a combination of color spaces with
the Bayesian network approach for robust detection of skin color followed by an
automated video categorization. Exper- imental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory performance for categorizing videos based on skin color.
