Jaccard similarity is widely used as a distance measure in many machine learning
and search applications. Typically, hashing methods are essential for the use of
Jaccard similarity to be practical in large-scale settings. For hashing binary (0/1)
data, the idea of one permutation hashing (OPH) with densification significantly
accelerates traditional minwise hashing algorithms while providing unbiased and
accurate estimates. In this paper, we propose a strategy named “re-randomization”
in the process of densification that could achieve the smallest variance among all
densification schemes. The success of this idea naturally inspires us to generalize
one permutation hashing to weighted (non-binary) data, which results in the socalled “bin-wise consistent weighted sampling (BCWS)” algorithm. We analyze the
behavior of BCWS and compare it with a recent alternative. Extensive experiments
on various datasets illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.
