Global Average Pooling (GAP) [4] has been used previously to generate class
activation for image classification tasks. The motivation behind SIMILARnet
comes from the fact that the convolutional filters possess position information
of the essential features and hence, combination of the feature maps could help
us locate the class instances in an image. We propose a biologically inspired
model that is free of differential connections and doesn't require separate
training thereby reducing computation overhead. Our novel architecture
generates promising results and unlike existing methods, the model is not
sensitive to the input image size, thus promising wider application. Codes for
the experiment and illustrations can be found at:
