Recently, a new method for encoding data sets in the form of "Density Codes"
was proposed in the literature (Courrieu, 2006). This method allows to compare
sets of points belonging to every multidimensional space, and to build shape
spaces invariant to a wide variety of affine and non-affine transformations.
However, this general method does not take advantage of the special properties
of image data, resulting in a quite slow encoding process that makes this tool
practically unusable for processing large image databases with conventional
computers. This paper proposes a very simple variant of the density code method
that directly works on the image function, which is thousands times faster than
the original Parzen window based method, without loss of its useful properties.
