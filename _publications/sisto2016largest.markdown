We show that the largest subsurface projection distance between a marking and
its image under the nth step of a random walk grows logarithmically in n, with
probability approaching 1 as n tends to infinity. Our setup is general and also
applies to (relatively) hyperbolic groups and to \\(\mathrm\{Out\}(F_n)\\). We then
use this result to prove Rivin's conjecture that for a random walk \\((w_n)\\) on
the mapping class group, the shortest geodesic in the hyperbolic mapping torus
\\(M_\{w_n\}\\) has length on the order of \\(1/ log^2(n)\\).
