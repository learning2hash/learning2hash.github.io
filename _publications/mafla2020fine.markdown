Text contained in an image carries high-level semantics that can be exploited
to achieve richer image understanding. In particular, the mere presence of text
provides strong guiding content that should be employed to tackle a diversity
of computer vision tasks such as image retrieval, fine-grained classification,
and visual question answering. In this paper, we address the problem of
fine-grained classification and image retrieval by leveraging textual
information along with visual cues to comprehend the existing intrinsic
relation between the two modalities. The novelty of the proposed model consists
of the usage of a PHOC descriptor to construct a bag of textual words along
with a Fisher Vector Encoding that captures the morphology of text. This
approach provides a stronger multimodal representation for this task and as our
experiments demonstrate, it achieves state-of-the-art results on two different
tasks, fine-grained classification and image retrieval.
