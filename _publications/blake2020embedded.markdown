In this paper we introduce a scheme for detecting manipulated audio and
video. The scheme is a synthesis of blockchains, encrypted spread spectrum
watermarks, perceptual hashing and digital signatures, which we call an
Embedded Blockchain. Within this scheme, we use the blockchain for its data
structure of a cryptographically linked list, cryptographic hashing for
absolute comparisons, perceptual hashing for flexible comparisons, digital
signatures for proof of ownership, and encrypted spread spectrum watermarking
to embed the blockchain into the background noise of the media. So each media
recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information
describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the
media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and
segment-by-segment of the media. If any chain is broken, the difference in the
computed and extracted perceptual hash is used to estimate the level of
manipulation.
