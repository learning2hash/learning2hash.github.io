We initiate the rigorous study of classification in quasi-metric spaces.
These are point sets endowed with a distance function that is non-negative and
also satisfies the triangle inequality, but is asymmetric. We develop and
refine a learning algorithm for quasi-metrics based on sample compression and
nearest neighbor, and prove that it has favorable statistical properties.
