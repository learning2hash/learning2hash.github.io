We introduce the notion of de Bruijn entropy of an Eulerian quiver and show
how the corresponding relative entropy can be applied to practical string
similarity problems. This approach explicitly links the combinatorial and
information-theoretical properties of words and its performance is superior to
edit distances in many respects and competitive in most others. The
computational complexity of our current implementation is parametrically
tunable between linear and cubic, and we outline how an optimized linear
algebra subroutine can reduce the cubic complexity to approximately linear.
Numerous examples are provided, including a realistic application to molecular
phylogenetics.
