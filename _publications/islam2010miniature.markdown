Due to the rapid development of World Wide Web (WWW) and imaging technology,
more and more images are available in the Internet and stored in databases.
Searching the related images by the querying image is becoming tedious and
difficult. Most of the images on the web are compressed by methods based on
discrete cosine transform (DCT) including Joint Photographic Experts
Group(JPEG) and H.261. This paper presents an efficient content-based image
indexing technique for searching similar images using discrete cosine transform
features. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority with the existing
techniques.
