This paper addresses the problem of designing binary codes for high-dimensional
data such that vectors that are similar in the original space map to similar binary
strings. We introduce a simple distribution-free encoding scheme based on
random projections, such that the expected Hamming distance between the binary
codes of two vectors is related to the value of a shift-invariant kernel (e.g., a
Gaussian kernel) between the vectors. We present a full theoretical analysis of the
convergence properties of the proposed scheme, and report favorable experimental
performance as compared to a recent state-of-the-art method, spectral hashing.
