Existing video indexing and retrieval methods on popular web-based multimedia
sharing websites are based on user-provided sparse tagging. This paper proposes
a very specific way of searching for video clips, based on the content of the
video. We present our work on Content-based Video Indexing and Retrieval using
the Correspondence-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (corr-LDA) probabilistic
framework. This is a model that provides for auto-annotation of videos in a
database with textual descriptors, and brings the added benefit of utilizing
the semantic relations between the content of the video and text. We use the
concept-level matching provided by corr-LDA to build correspondences between
text and multimedia, with the objective of retrieving content with increased
accuracy. In our experiments, we employ only the audio components of the
individual recordings and compare our results with an SVM-based approach.
