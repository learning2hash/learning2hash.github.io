The \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(i\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}th coordinate of an \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((n,k)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} code is said to have locality \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(r\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and availability \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} if there exist \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} disjoint groups, each containing at most \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(r\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} other coordinates that can together recover the value of the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(i\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}th coordinate. This property is particularly useful for codes for distributed storage systems because it permits local repair and parallel accesses of hot data. In this paper, for any positive integers \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(r\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, we construct a binary linear code of length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\binom\{r+t\}\{t\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} which has locality \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(r\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and availability \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(t\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for all coordinates. The information rate of this code attains \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\frac\{r\}\{r+t\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, which is always higher than that of the direct product code, the only known construction that can achieve arbitrary locality and availability.
