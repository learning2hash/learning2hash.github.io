<p>The <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th coordinate of an <span
class="math inline">\((n,k)\)</span> code is said to have locality <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and availability <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> if there exist <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> disjoint groups, each containing at
most <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> other coordinates that can
together recover the value of the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th coordinate. This property is
particularly useful for codes for distributed storage systems because it
permits local repair and parallel accesses of hot data. In this paper,
for any positive integers <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we construct a binary linear
code of length <span class="math inline">\(\binom{r+t}{t}\)</span> which
has locality <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and availability
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for all coordinates. The
information rate of this code attains <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{r}{r+t}\)</span>, which is always higher
than that of the direct product code, the only known construction that
can achieve arbitrary locality and availability.</p>
