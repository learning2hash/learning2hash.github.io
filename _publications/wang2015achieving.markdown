The \{i\}th coordinate of an \{(n,k)\} code is said to have locality \{r\} and
availability \{t\} if there exist \{t\} disjoint groups, each containing at most
\{r\} other coordinates that can together recover the value of the \{i\}th
coordinate. This property is particularly useful for codes for distributed
storage systems because it permits local repair and parallel accesses of hot
data. In this paper, for any positive integers \{r\} and \{t\}, we construct a
binary linear code of length \{\binom{r+t}{t}\} which has locality \{r\} and
availability \{t\} for all coordinates. The information rate of this code attains
\{\frac{r}{r+t}\}, which is always higher than that of the direct product code,
the only known construction that can achieve arbitrary locality and
availability.
