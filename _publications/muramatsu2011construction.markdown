The aim of this paper is to introduce the construction of codes for a general
discrete stationary memoryless multiple access channel based on the the notion
of the hash property. Since an ensemble of sparse matrices has a hash property,
we can use sparse matrices for code construction. Our approach has a potential
advantage compared to the conventional random coding because it is expected
that we can use some approximation algorithms by using the sparse structure of
codes.
