Few-weight codes have been constructed and studied for many years, since
their fascinating relations to finite geometries, strongly regular graphs and
Boolean functions. Simplex codes are one-weight Griesmer \([\frac\{q^k-1\}\{q-1\},k
,q^\{k-1\}]_q\)-linear codes and they meet all Griesmer bounds of the generalized
Hamming weights of linear codes. All the subcodes with dimension \(r\) of a
\([\frac\{q^k-1\}\{q-1\},k ,q^\{k-1\}]_q\)-simplex code have the same subcode support
weight \(\frac\{q^\{k-r\}(q^r-1)\}\{q-1\}\) for \(1\leq r\leq k\). In this paper, we
construct linear codes meeting the Griesmer bound of the \(r\)-generalized
Hamming weight, such codes do not meet the Griesmer bound of the
\(j\)-generalized Hamming weight for \(1\leq j<r\). Moreover these codes have only
few subcode support weights. The weight distribution and the subcode support
weight distributions of these distance-optimal codes are determined. Linear
codes constructed in this paper are natural generalizations of distance-optimal
few-weight codes.
