This paper describes the sixteen Duluth entries in the Senseval-2 comparative
exercise among word sense disambiguation systems. There were eight pairs of
Duluth systems entered in the Spanish and English lexical sample tasks. These
are all based on standard machine learning algorithms that induce classifiers
from sense-tagged training text where the context in which ambiguous words
occur are represented by simple lexical features. These are highly portable,
robust methods that can serve as a foundation for more tailored approaches.
