Hit song prediction, one of the emerging fields in music information
retrieval (MIR), remains a considerable challenge. Being able to understand
what makes a given song a hit is clearly beneficial to the whole music
industry. Previous approaches to hit song prediction have focused on using
audio features of a record. This study aims to improve the prediction result of
the top 10 hits among Billboard Hot 100 songs using more alternative metadata,
including song audio features provided by Spotify, song lyrics, and novel
metadata-based features (title topic, popularity continuity and genre class).
Five machine learning approaches are applied, including: k-nearest neighbours,
Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron. Our
results show that Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) with all
features (including novel features, song audio features and lyrics features)
outperforms other models, achieving 89.1% and 87.2% accuracy, and 0.91 and 0.93
AUC, respectively. Our findings also demonstrate the utility of our novel music
metadata features, which contributed most to the models' discriminative
performance.
