Score prediction is crucial in evaluating realistic image sharpness based on
collected informative features. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs)
have been developed and witnessed remarkable success in data fitting. This
study introduces the Taylor series-based KAN (TaylorKAN). Then, different KANs
are explored in four realistic image databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, and
KonIQ-10k) to predict the scores by using 15 mid-level features and 2048
high-level features. Compared to support vector regression, results show that
KANs are generally competitive or superior, and TaylorKAN is the best one when
mid-level features are used. This is the first study to investigate KANs on
image quality assessment that sheds some light on how to select and further
improve KANs in related tasks.
