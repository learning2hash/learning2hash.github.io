Sequence feature embedding is a challenging task due to the unstructuredness
of sequence, i.e., arbitrary strings of arbitrary length. Existing methods are
efficient in extracting short-term dependencies but typically suffer from
computation issues for the long-term. Sequence Graph Transform (SGT), a feature
embedding function, that can extract a varying amount of short- to long-term
dependencies without increasing the computation is proposed. SGT's properties
are analytically proved for interpretation under normal and uniform
distribution assumptions. SGT features yield significantly superior results in
sequence clustering and classification with higher accuracy and lower
computation as compared to the existing methods, including the state-of-the-art
sequence/string Kernels and LSTM.
