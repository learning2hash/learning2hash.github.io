Given a finite set \(S\), i.i.d. random weights \(\\{X_i\\}_\{i\in S\}\), and a
family of subsets \(\mathcal\{F\}\subseteq 2^S\), we consider the minimum weight of
an \(F\in \mathcal\{F\}\): \[ M(\mathcal\{F\}):= \min_\{F\in \mathcal\{F\}\} \sum_\{i\in
F\}X_i. \] In particular, we investigate under what conditions this random
variable is sharply concentrated around its mean.
  We define the patchability of a family \(\mathcal\{F\}\): essentially, how
expensive is it to finish an almost-complete \(F\) (that is, \(F\) is close to
\(\mathcal\{F\}\) in Hamming distance) if the edge weights are re-randomized?
Combining the patchability of \(\mathcal\{F\}\), applying the Talagrand inequality
to a dual problem, and a sprinkling-type argument, we prove a concentration
inequality for the random variable \(M(\mathcal\{F\})\).
