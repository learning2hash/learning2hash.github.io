Maximum distance separable convolutional codes are characterized by the
property that the free distance reaches the generalized Singleton bound, which
makes them optimal for error correction. However, the existing constructions of
such codes are available over fields of large size. In this paper, we present
the unique construction of MDS convolutional codes of rate 1/2 and degree 5
over the field F_\{11\}.
