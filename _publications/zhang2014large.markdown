Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, hashing
has been widely adopted for similarity search in multimedia
data. In particular, more and more attentions
have been payed to multimodal hashing for search in
multimedia data with multiple modalities, such as images
with tags. Typically, supervised information of semantic
labels is also available for the data points in
many real applications. Hence, many supervised multimodal
hashing (SMH) methods have been proposed
to utilize such semantic labels to further improve the
search accuracy. However, the training time complexity
of most existing SMH methods is too high, which
makes them unscalable to large-scale datasets. In this
paper, a novel SMH method, called semantic correlation
maximization (SCM), is proposed to seamlessly integrate
semantic labels into the hashing learning procedure
for large-scale data modeling. Experimental results
on two real-world datasets show that SCM can signifi-
cantly outperform the state-of-the-art SMH methods, in
terms of both accuracy and scalability.
