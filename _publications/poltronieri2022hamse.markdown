The use of Semantic Technologies - in particular the Semantic Web - has
revealed to be a great tool for describing the cultural heritage domain and
artistic practices. However, the panorama of ontologies for musicological
applications seems to be limited and restricted to specific applications. In
this research, we propose HaMSE, an ontology capable of describing musical
features that can assist musicological research. More specifically, HaMSE
proposes to address sues that have been affecting musicological research for
decades: the representation of music and the relationship between quantitative
and qualitative data. To do this, HaMSE allows the alignment between different
music representation systems and describes a set of musicological features that
can allow the music analysis at different granularity levels.
