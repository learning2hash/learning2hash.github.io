This work aims to address an open problem in data valuation literature
concerning the efficient computation of Data Shapley for weighted \(K\) nearest
neighbor algorithm (WKNN-Shapley). By considering the accuracy of hard-label
KNN with discretized weights as the utility function, we reframe the
computation of WKNN-Shapley into a counting problem and introduce a
quadratic-time algorithm, presenting a notable improvement from \(O(N^K)\), the
best result from existing literature. We develop a deterministic approximation
algorithm that further improves computational efficiency while maintaining the
key fairness properties of the Shapley value. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate WKNN-Shapley's computational efficiency and its superior
performance in discerning data quality compared to its unweighted counterpart.
