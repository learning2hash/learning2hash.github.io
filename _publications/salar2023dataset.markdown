Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the essential applications of
Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is also an instrument that plays a
significant role in many other NLP applications, such as Machine Translation
(MT), Information Retrieval (IR), and Part of Speech Tagging (POST). Kurdish is
an under-resourced language from the NLP perspective. Particularly, in all the
categories, the lack of NER resources hinders other aspects of Kurdish
processing. In this work, we present a data set that covers several categories
of NEs in Kurdish (Sorani). The dataset is a significant amendment to a
previously developed dataset in the Kurdish BLARK (Basic Language Resource
Kit). It covers 11 categories and 33261 entries in total. The dataset is
