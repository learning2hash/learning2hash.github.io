Deep hashing techniques have emerged as the predominant approach for efficient image retrieval. Traditionally these methods utilize pre45;trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and VGG45;16 as feature extractors. However the increasing complexity of datasets poses challenges for these backbone architectures in capturing meaningful features essential for effective image retrieval. In this study we explore the efficacy of employing high45;resolution features learned through state45;of45;the45;art techniques for image retrieval tasks. Specifically we propose a novel methodology that utilizes High45;Resolution Networks (HRNets) as the backbone for the deep hashing task termed High45;Resolution Hashing Network (HHNet). Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across all tested benchmark datasets including CIFAR45;10 NUS45;WIDE MS COCO and ImageNet. This performance improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets which highlights the need to learn high45;resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks. Furthermore we conduct a comprehensive analysis of different HRNet configurations and provide insights into the optimal architecture for the deep hashing task
