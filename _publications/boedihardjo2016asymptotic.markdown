Appropriately normalized square random Vandermonde matrices based on
independent random variables with uniform distribution on the unit circle are
studied. It is shown that as the matrix sizes increases without bound, with
respect to the expectation of the trace there is an asymptotic *-distribution,
equal to that of a C[0,1]-valued R-diagonal element.
