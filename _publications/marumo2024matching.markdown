Not identical but similar objects are ubiquitous in our world, ranging from
four-legged animals such as dogs and cats to cars of different models and
flowers of various colors. This study addresses a novel task of matching such
non-identical objects at the pixel level. We propose a weighting scheme of
descriptors that incorporates semantic information from object detectors into
existing sparse image matching methods, extending their targets from identical
objects captured from different perspectives to semantically similar objects.
The experiments show successful matching between non-identical objects in
various cases, including in-class design variations, class discrepancy, and
domain shifts (e.g., photo--drawing and image corruptions).
