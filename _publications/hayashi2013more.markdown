<p>We explicitly construct random hash functions for privacy
amplification (extractors) that require smaller random seed lengths than
the previous literature, and still allow efficient implementations with
complexity <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log
n)\)</span> for input length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The
key idea is the concept of dual universal<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> hash function introduced recently. We
also use a new method for constructing extractors by concatenating <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-almost dual universal<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> hash functions with other extractors.
Besides minimizing seed lengths, we also introduce methods that allow
one to use non-uniform random seeds for extractors. These methods can be
applied to a wide class of extractors, including dual universal<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> hash function, as well as to
conventional universal<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> hash
functions.</p>
