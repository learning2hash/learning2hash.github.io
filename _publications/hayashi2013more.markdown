We explicitly construct random hash functions for privacy amplification (extractors) that require smaller random seed lengths than the previous literature, and still allow efficient implementations with complexity $O(n\log n)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( for input length \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}n\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(. The key idea is the concept of dual universal\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\_2$ hash function introduced recently. We also use a new method for constructing extractors by concatenating \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-almost dual universal\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} hash functions with other extractors. Besides minimizing seed lengths, we also introduce methods that allow one to use non-uniform random seeds for extractors. These methods can be applied to a wide class of extractors, including dual universal\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} hash function, as well as to conventional universal\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} hash functions.
