We explicitly construct random hash functions for privacy amplification
(extractors) that require smaller random seed lengths than the previous
literature, and still allow efficient implementations with complexity \\(O(nlog
n)\\) for input length \\(n\\). The key idea is the concept of dual universal\\(_2\\)
hash function introduced recently. We also use a new method for constructing
extractors by concatenating \\(\delta\\)-almost dual universal\\(_2\\) hash functions
with other extractors. Besides minimizing seed lengths, we also introduce
methods that allow one to use non-uniform random seeds for extractors. These
methods can be applied to a wide class of extractors, including dual
universal\\(_2\\) hash function, as well as to conventional universal\\(_2\\) hash
functions.
