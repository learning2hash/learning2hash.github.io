This paper introduces a polynomial blind algorithm that determines when two
square matrices, \(A\) and \(B\), are permutation similar. The shifted and
translated matrices \((A+\beta I+\gamma J)\) and \((B+\beta I+\gamma J)\) are used
to color the vertices of two square, edge weighted, rook's graphs. Then the
orbits are found by repeated symbolic squaring of the vertex colored and edge
weighted adjacency matrices. Multisets of the diagonal symbols from
non-permutation similar matrices are distinct within a few iterations,
typically four or less.
