We present a tool that, from automatically recognised names, tries to infer
inter-person relations in order to present associated people on maps. Based on
an in-house Named Entity Recognition tool, applied on clusters of an average of
15,000 news articles per day, in 15 different languages, we build a knowledge
base that allows extracting statistical co-occurrences of persons and
visualising them on a per-person page or in various graphs.
