With the advent of the Internet, billions of images
are now freely available online and constitute a dense sampling
of the visual world. Using a variety of non-parametric methods,
we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017
images collected from the Web. Motivated by psychophysical
results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual
system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the
dataset are stored as 32 Ã— 32 color images. Each image is
loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in
English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the
image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object
categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet
can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to
perform object classification over a range of semantic levels
minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that
are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are
able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to
class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors.
