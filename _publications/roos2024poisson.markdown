We use the Stein-Chen method to prove new explicit inequalities for the total
variation, Wasserstein and local distances between the distribution of a random
diagonal sum of a Bernoulli matrix and a Poisson distribution. Approximation
results using a finite signed measure of higher order are given as well. Some
of our bounds improve on those in Theorem 4.A of A.D. Barbour, L. Holst and S.
Janson (Poisson approximation. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992).
