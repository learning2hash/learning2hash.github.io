Text is ubiquitous in the artificial world and easily attainable when it comes
to book title and author names. Using the images from the book cover set from
the Stanford Mobile Visual Search dataset and additional book covers and
metadata from openlibrary.org, we construct a large scale book cover retrieval
dataset, complete with 100K distractor covers and title and author strings for
each. Because our query images are poorly conditioned for clean text extraction,
we propose a method for extracting a matching noisy and erroneous OCR readings
and matching it against clean author and book title strings in a standard
document look-up problem setup. Finally, we demonstrate how to use this text-
matching as a feature in conjunction with popular retrieval features such as
VLAD using a simple learning setup to achieve significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy over that of either VLAD or the text alone.
