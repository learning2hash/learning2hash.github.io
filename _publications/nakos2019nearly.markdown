In this paper, we consider the extensively studied problem of computing a
\(k\)-sparse approximation to the \(d\)-dimensional Fourier transform of a length
\(n\) signal. Our algorithm uses \(O(k log k log n)\) samples, is dimension-free,
operates for any universe size, and achieves the strongest \(\ell_\infty/ℓ₂\)
guarantee, while running in a time comparable to the Fast Fourier Transform. In
contrast to previous algorithms which proceed either via the Restricted
Isometry Property or via filter functions, our approach offers a fresh
perspective to the sparse Fourier Transform problem.
