With the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep learning models
capable of learning complex representations, impressive advances have emerged
in face detection and recognition tasks. Despite such advances, existing
datasets do not capture the difficulty of face recognition in the wildest
scenarios, such as hostile disputes or fights. Furthermore, existing datasets
do not represent completely unconstrained cases of low resolution, high blur
and large pose/occlusion variances. To this end, we introduce the Wildest Faces
dataset, which focuses on such adverse effects through violent scenes. The
dataset consists of an extensive set of violent scenes of celebrities from
movies. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art techniques
are not well-suited for violent scenes, and therefore, Wildest Faces is likely
to stir further interest in face detection and recognition research.
