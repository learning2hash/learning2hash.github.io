The inclusion of Computer Vision and Deep Learning technologies in
Agriculture aims to increase the harvest quality, and productivity of farmers.
During postharvest, the export market and quality evaluation are affected by
assorting of fruits and vegetables. In particular, apples are susceptible to a
wide range of defects that can occur during harvesting or/and during the
post-harvesting period. This paper aims to help farmers with post-harvest
handling by exploring if recent computer vision and deep learning methods such
as the YOLOv3 (Redmon & Farhadi (2018)) can help in detecting healthy apples
from apples with defects.
