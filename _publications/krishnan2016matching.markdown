We address the problem of predicting similarity between a pair of handwritten
document images written by different individuals. This has applications related
to matching and mining in image collections containing handwritten content. A
similarity score is computed by detecting patterns of text re-usages between
document images irrespective of the minor variations in word morphology, word
ordering, layout and paraphrasing of the content. Our method does not depend on
an accurate segmentation of words and lines. We formulate the document matching
problem as a structured comparison of the word distributions across two
document images. To match two word images, we propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN) based feature descriptor. Performance of this representation
surpasses the state-of-the-art on handwritten word spotting. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our method on a practical problem of matching
handwritten assignments.
