We propose to use the concept of the Hamming bound to derive the optimal
criteria for learning hash codes with a deep network. In particular, when the
number of binary hash codes (typically the number of image categories) and code
length are known, it is possible to derive an upper bound on the minimum
Hamming distance between the hash codes. This upper bound can then be used to
define the loss function for learning hash codes. By encouraging the margin
(minimum Hamming distance) between the hash codes of different image categories
to match the upper bound, we are able to learn theoretically optimal hash
codes. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms competing
deep learning-based approaches and obtains top performance on benchmark
datasets.
