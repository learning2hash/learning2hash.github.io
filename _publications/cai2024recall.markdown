Human memory is inherently prone to forgetting. To address this, multimodal
embedding models have been introduced, which transform diverse real-world data
into a unified embedding space. These embeddings can be retrieved efficiently,
aiding mobile users in recalling past information. However, as model complexity
grows, so do its resource demands, leading to reduced throughput and heavy
computational requirements that limit mobile device implementation. In this
paper, we introduce RECALL, a novel on-device multimodal embedding system
optimized for resource-limited mobile environments. RECALL achieves
high-throughput, accurate retrieval by generating coarse-grained embeddings and
leveraging query-based filtering for refined retrieval. Experimental results
demonstrate that RECALL delivers high-quality embeddings with superior
throughput, all while operating unobtrusively with minimal memory and energy
consumption.
