Search in collections of digitised historical documents is hindered by a
two-prong problem, orthographic variety and optical character recognition (OCR)
mistakes. We present a new search engine for historical documents, DuoSearch,
which uses ElasticSearch and machine learning methods based on deep neural
networks to offer a solution to this problem. It was tested on a collection of
historical newspapers in Bulgarian from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century.
The system provides an interactive and intuitive interface for the end-users
allowing them to enter search terms in modern Bulgarian and search across
historical spellings. This is the first solution facilitating the use of
digitised historical documents in Bulgarian.
