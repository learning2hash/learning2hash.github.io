Experiencing images with suitable music can greatly enrich the overall user
experience. The proposed image analysis method treats an artwork image
differently from a photograph image. Automatic image classification is
performed using deep-learning based models. An illustrative analysis showcasing
the ability of our deep-models to inherently learn and utilize perceptually
relevant features when classifying artworks is also presented. The Mean Opinion
Score (MOS) obtained from subjective assessments of the respective image and
recommended music pairs supports the effectiveness of our approach.
