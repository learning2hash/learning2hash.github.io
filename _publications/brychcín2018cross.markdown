We generalize the word analogy task across languages, to provide a new
intrinsic evaluation method for cross-lingual semantic spaces. We experiment
with six languages within different language families, including English,
German, Spanish, Italian, Czech, and Croatian. State-of-the-art monolingual
semantic spaces are transformed into a shared space using dictionaries of word
translations. We compare several linear transformations and rank them for
experiments with monolingual (no transformation), bilingual (one semantic space
is transformed to another), and multilingual (all semantic spaces are
transformed onto English space) versions of semantic spaces. We show that
tested linear transformations preserve relationships between words (word
analogies) and lead to impressive results. We achieve average accuracy of
51.1%, 43.1%, and 38.2% for monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual semantic
spaces, respectively.
