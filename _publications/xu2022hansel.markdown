Modern Entity Linking (EL) systems entrench a popularity bias, yet there is
no dataset focusing on tail and emerging entities in languages other than
English. We present Hansel, a new benchmark in Chinese that fills the vacancy
of non-English few-shot and zero-shot EL challenges. The test set of Hansel is
human annotated and reviewed, created with a novel method for collecting
zero-shot EL datasets. It covers 10K diverse documents in news, social media
posts and other web articles, with Wikidata as its target Knowledge Base. We
demonstrate that the existing state-of-the-art EL system performs poorly on
Hansel (R@1 of 36.6% on Few-Shot). We then establish a strong baseline that
scores a R@1 of 46.2% on Few-Shot and 76.6% on Zero-Shot on our dataset. We
also show that our baseline achieves competitive results on TAC-KBP2015 Chinese
Entity Linking task.
