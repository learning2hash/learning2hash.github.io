Fine-Grained Image Recognition (FGIR) is a fundamental and challenging task
in computer vision and multimedia that plays a crucial role in Intellectual
Economy and Industrial Internet applications. However, the absence of a unified
open-source software library covering various paradigms in FGIR poses a
significant challenge for researchers and practitioners in the field. To
address this gap, we present Hawkeye, a PyTorch-based library for FGIR with
deep learning. Hawkeye is designed with a modular architecture, emphasizing
high-quality code and human-readable configuration, providing a comprehensive
solution for FGIR tasks. In Hawkeye, we have implemented 16 state-of-the-art
fine-grained methods, covering 6 different paradigms, enabling users to explore
various approaches for FGIR. To the best of our knowledge, Hawkeye represents
the first open-source PyTorch-based library dedicated to FGIR. It is publicly
available at https://github.com/Hawkeye-FineGrained/Hawkeye/, providing
researchers and practitioners with a powerful tool to advance their research
and development in the field of FGIR.
