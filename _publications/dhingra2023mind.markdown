Cognitive psychology delves on understanding perception attention memory language problem-solving decision-making and reasoning. Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as potent tools increasingly capable of performing human-level tasks. The recent development in the form of GPT-4 and its demonstrated success in tasks complex to humans exam and complex problems has led to an increased confidence in the LLMs to become perfect instruments of intelligence. Although GPT-4 report has shown performance on some cognitive psychology tasks a comprehensive assessment of GPT-4 via the existing well-established datasets is required. In this study we focus on the evaluation of GPT-4s performance on a set of cognitive psychology datasets such as CommonsenseQA SuperGLUE MATH and HANS. In doing so we understand how GPT-4 processes and integrates cognitive psychology with contextual information providing insight into the underlying cognitive processes that enable its ability to generate the responses. We show that GPT-4 exhibits a high level of accuracy in cognitive psychology tasks relative to the prior state-of-the-art models. Our results strengthen the already available assessments and confidence on GPT-4s cognitive psychology abilities. It has significant potential to revolutionize the field of AI by enabling machines to bridge the gap between human and machine reasoning.
