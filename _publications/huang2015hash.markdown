In this paper we introduce a novel hash learning framework that has two main
distinguishing features, when compared to past approaches. First, it utilizes
codewords in the Hamming space as ancillary means to accomplish its hash
learning task. These codewords, which are inferred from the data, attempt to
capture similarity aspects of the data's hash codes. Secondly and more
importantly, the same framework is capable of addressing supervised,
unsupervised and, even, semi-supervised hash learning tasks in a natural manner.
A series of comparative experiments focused on content-based image retrieval
highlights its performance advantages.
