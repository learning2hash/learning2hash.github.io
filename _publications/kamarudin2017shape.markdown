Nowadays, more and more images are available. Annotation and retrieval of the
images pose classification problems, where each class is defined as the group
of database images labelled with a common semantic label. Various systems have
been proposed for content-based retrieval, as well as for image classification
and indexing. In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been
proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-category
image classification. A well known pre-processing and post-processing method
was used and applied to three problems; image segmentation, object
identification and image classification. The method was applied to classify
single object images from Amazon and Google datasets. The classification was
tested for four different classifiers; BayesNetwork (BN), Random Forest (RF),
Bagging and Vote. The estimated classification accuracies ranged from 20% to
99% (using 10-fold cross validation). The Bagging classifier presents the best
performance, followed by the Random Forest classifier.
