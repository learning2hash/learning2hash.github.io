This paper proposes a geodesic-distance-based feature that encodes global
information for improved video segmentation algorithms. The feature is a joint
histogram of intensity and geodesic distances, where the geodesic distances are
computed as the shortest paths between superpixels via their boundaries. We
also incorporate adaptive voting weights and spatial pyramid configurations to
include spatial information into the geodesic histogram feature and show that
this further improves results. The feature is generic and can be used as part
of various algorithms. In experiments, we test the geodesic histogram feature
by incorporating it into two existing video segmentation frameworks. This leads
to significantly better performance in 3D video segmentation benchmarks on two
datasets.
