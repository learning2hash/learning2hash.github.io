In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, \textbf\{Kimia Path24\}, for image
classification and retrieval in digital pathology. We use the whole scan images
of 24 different tissue textures to generate 1,325 test patches of size
1000\(\times\)1000 (0.5mm\(\times\)0.5mm). Training data can be generated according
to preferences of algorithm designer and can range from approximately 27,000 to
over 50,000 patches if the preset parameters are adopted. We propose a compound
patch-and-scan accuracy measurement that makes achieving high accuracies quite
challenging. In addition, we set the benchmarking line by applying LBP,
dictionary approach and convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and report their
results. The highest accuracy was 41.80% for CNN.
