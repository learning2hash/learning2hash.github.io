In pattern recognition, learning, and data mining one obtains information
from information-carrying objects. This involves an objective definition of the
information in a single object, the information to go from one object to
another object in a pair of objects, the information to go from one object to
any other object in a multiple of objects, and the shared information between
objects. This is called "information distance." We survey a selection of new
developments in information distance.
