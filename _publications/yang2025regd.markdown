Hierarchical data are common in many domains like life sciences and
e-commerce, and their embeddings often play a critical role. Although
hyperbolic embeddings offer a grounded approach to representing hierarchical
structures in low-dimensional spaces, their utility is hindered by optimization
difficulties in hyperbolic space and dependence on handcrafted structural
constraints. We propose RegD, a novel Euclidean framework that addresses these
limitations by representing hierarchical data as geometric regions with two new
metrics: (1) depth distance, which preserves the representational power of
hyperbolic spaces for hierarchical data, and (2) boundary distance, which
explicitly encodes set-inclusion relationships between regions in a general
way. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD's
potential for broader applications beyond hierarchy alone tasks.
