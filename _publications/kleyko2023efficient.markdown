We investigate the task of retrieving information from compositional
distributed representations formed by Hyperdimensional Computing/Vector
Symbolic Architectures and present novel techniques which achieve new
information rate bounds. First, we provide an overview of the decoding
techniques that can be used to approach the retrieval task. The techniques are
categorized into four groups. We then evaluate the considered techniques in
several settings that involve, e.g., inclusion of external noise and storage
elements with reduced precision. In particular, we find that the decoding
techniques from the sparse coding and compressed sensing literature (rarely
used for Hyperdimensional Computing/Vector Symbolic Architectures) are also
well-suited for decoding information from the compositional distributed
representations. Combining these decoding techniques with interference
cancellation ideas from communications improves previously reported bounds
(Hersche et al., 2021) of the information rate of the distributed
representations from 1.20 to 1.40 bits per dimension for smaller codebooks and
from 0.60 to 1.26 bits per dimension for larger codebooks.
