Privacy scoring aims at measuring the privacy violation risk of a user over
an online social network (OSN). Existing work in the field rely on possibly
biased or emotional survey data and focus only on personel purpose OSNs like
Facebook. In contrast to existing work, in this thesis, we work with real-world
OSN data collected from LinkedIn, the most popular professional-purpose OSN
(ProOSN). Towards this end, we developed an extensive crawler to collect all
relevant profile data of 5,389 LinkedIn users, modelled these data using both
relational and graph databases and quantitatively analyzed all privacy risk
scoring methods in the literature. Additionally, we propose a novel scoring
method that consider the granularity of data an OSN user shares on her profile
page. Extensive experimental evaluation of existing and proposed scoring
methods indicates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
