Social networking has become a major part of all our lives and we depend on
it for day to day purposes. It is a medium that is used by people all around
the world even in the smallest of towns. Its main purpose is to promote and aid
communication between people. Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter etc.
were created for the sole purpose of helping individuals communicate about
anything with each other. These networks are becoming an important and also
contemporary method to make friends from any part of this world. These new
friends can communicate through any form of social media. Recommendation
systems exist in all the social networks which aid users to find new friends
and unite to more people and form associations and alliances with people.
