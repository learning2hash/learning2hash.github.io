Recent advances in image editing techniques have posed serious challenges to
the trustworthiness of multimedia data, which drives the research of image
tampering detection. In this paper, we propose ObjectFormer to detect and
localize image manipulations. To capture subtle manipulation traces that are no
longer visible in the RGB domain, we extract high-frequency features of the
images and combine them with RGB features as multimodal patch embeddings.
Additionally, we use a set of learnable object prototypes as mid-level
representations to model the object-level consistencies among different
regions, which are further used to refine patch embeddings to capture the
patch-level consistencies. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets
and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming
state-of-the-art tampering detection and localization methods.
