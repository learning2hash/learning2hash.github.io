Recently, sound recognition has been used to identify sounds, such as car and
river. However, sounds have nuances that may be better described by
adjective-noun pairs such as slow car, and verb-noun pairs such as flying
insects, which are under explored. Therefore, in this work we investigate the
relation between audio content and both adjective-noun pairs and verb-noun
pairs. Due to the lack of datasets with these kinds of annotations, we
collected and processed the AudioPairBank corpus consisting of a combined total
of 1,123 pairs and over 33,000 audio files. One contribution is the previously
unavailable documentation of the challenges and implications of collecting
audio recordings with these type of labels. A second contribution is to show
the degree of correlation between the audio content and the labels through
sound recognition experiments, which yielded results of 70% accuracy, hence
also providing a performance benchmark. The results and study in this paper
encourage further exploration of the nuances in audio and are meant to
complement similar research performed on images and text in multimedia
analysis.
