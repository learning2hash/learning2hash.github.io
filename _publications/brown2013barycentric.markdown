Barycentric coordinates are frequently used as interpolants to shade computer
graphics images. A simple equation transforms barycentric coordinates from
screen space into eye space in order to undo the perspective transformation and
permit accurate interpolative shading of texture maps. This technique is
amenable to computation using a block-normalized integer representation.
