In this project, a state-of-the-art deep convolution neural network (DCNN) is
presented to segment seismic images for salt detection below the earth's
surface. Detection of salt location is very important for starting mining.
Hence, a seismic image is used to detect the exact salt location under the
earth's surface. However, precisely detecting the exact location of salt
deposits is difficult. Therefore, professional seismic imaging still requires
expert human interpretation of salt bodies. This leads to very subjective,
highly variable renderings. Hence, to create the most accurate seismic images
and 3D renderings, we need a robust algorithm that automatically and accurately
identifies if a surface target is a salt or not. Since the performance of DCNN
is well-known and well-established for object recognition in images, DCNN is a
very good choice for this particular problem and being successfully applied to
a dataset of seismic images in which each pixel is labeled as salt or not. The
result of this algorithm is promising.
