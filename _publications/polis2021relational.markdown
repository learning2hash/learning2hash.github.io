We show that a deep learning model with built-in relational inductive bias
can bring benefits to sample-efficient learning, without relying on extensive
data augmentation. The proposed one-shot classification model performs
relational matching of a pair of inputs in the form of local and pairwise
attention. Our approach solves perfectly the one-shot image classification
Omniglot challenge. Our model exceeds human level accuracy, as well as the
previous state of the art, with no data augmentation.
