The aim of the present work is to show that recent results of the authors on
the approximation of distributions of sums of independent summands by the
infinitely divisible laws on convex polyhedra can be shown via an alternative
class of approximating infinitely divisible distributions. We will also
generalize the results to the infinite-dimensional case.
