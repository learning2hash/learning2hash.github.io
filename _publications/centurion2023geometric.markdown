We propose a label poisoning attack on geometric data sets against
\(k\)-nearest neighbor classification. We provide an algorithm that can compute
an \(\epsilon n\)-additive approximation of the optimal poisoning in \(n\cdot
2^\{2^\{O(d+k/\epsilon)\}\}\) time for a given data set \(X \in \mathbb\{R\}^d\),
where \(|X| = n\). Our algorithm achieves its objectives through the application
of multi-scale random partitions.
