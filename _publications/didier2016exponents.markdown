If X(c^E t) and c^H X(t) have the same finite-dimensional distributions for
some linear operators E and H, we say that the random vector field X(t) is
operator self-similar. The exponents E and H are not unique in general, due to
symmetry. This paper characterizes the possible set of range exponents H for a
given domain exponent, and conversely, the set of domain exponents E for a
given range exponent.
