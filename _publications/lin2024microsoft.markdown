<p>We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the
state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object
recognition in the context of the broader question of scene
understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday
scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are
labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object
localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would
be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million
labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon
extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for
category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We
present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to
PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance
analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a
Deformable Parts Model.</p>
