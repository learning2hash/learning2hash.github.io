We demonstrate an application of the closest point method where the truncated
spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator of an object is used to identify the
object. The effectiveness of the method is analyzed as well as the default
algorithm, `eigs', in MATLAB which computes the eigenvalues of a given matrix.
We also cluster "similar" objects via multi-dimensional scaling algorithm and
empirically measure its effectiveness.
