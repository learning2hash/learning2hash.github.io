For any \(n>1\) and \(0<\epsilon<1/2\), we show the existence of an
\(n^\{O(1)\}\)-point subset \(X\) of \(\mathbb\{R\}^n\) such that any linear map from
\((X,ℓ₂)\) to \(ℓ₂^m\) with distortion at most \(1+\epsilon\) must have \(m
= Ω(\min\\{n, \epsilon^\{-2\}log n\\})\). Our lower bound matches the upper
bounds provided by the identity matrix and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma,
improving the previous lower bound of Alon by a \(log(1/\epsilon)\) factor.
