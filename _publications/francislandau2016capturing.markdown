A key challenge in entity linking is making effective use of contextual
information to disambiguate mentions that might refer to different entities in
different contexts. We present a model that uses convolutional neural networks
to capture semantic correspondence between a mention's context and a proposed
target entity. These convolutional networks operate at multiple granularities
to exploit various kinds of topic information, and their rich parameterization
gives them the capacity to learn which n-grams characterize different topics.
We combine these networks with a sparse linear model to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on multiple entity linking datasets, outperforming
the prior systems of Durrett and Klein (2014) and Nguyen et al. (2014).
