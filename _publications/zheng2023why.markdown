Recent advancements in large language models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated significant potential to impact various aspects of human life. However ChatGPT still faces challenges in providing reliable and accurate answers to user questions. To better understand the models particular weaknesses in providing truthful answers we embark an in-depth exploration of open-domain question answering. Specifically we undertake a detailed examination of ChatGPTs failures categorized into comprehension factuality specificity and inference. We further pinpoint factuality as the most contributing failure and identify two critical abilities associated with factuality knowledge memorization and knowledge recall. Through experiments focusing on factuality we propose several potential enhancement strategies. Our findings suggest that augmenting the model with granular external knowledge and cues for knowledge recall can enhance the models factuality in answering questions.
