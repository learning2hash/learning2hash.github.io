We propose a method for the weakly supervised detection of objects in
paintings. At training time, only image-level annotations are needed. This,
combined with the efficiency of our multiple-instance learning method, enables
one to learn new classes on-the-fly from globally annotated databases, avoiding
the tedious task of manually marking objects. We show on several databases that
dropping the instance-level annotations only yields mild performance losses. We
also introduce a new database, IconArt, on which we perform detection
experiments on classes that could not be learned on photographs, such as Jesus
Child or Saint Sebastian. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
experiments dealing with the automatic (and in our case weakly supervised)
detection of iconographic elements in paintings. We believe that such a method
is of great benefit for helping art historians to explore large digital
databases.
