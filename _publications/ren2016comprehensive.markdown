Sparse representation has been applied successfully in abnormal event
detection, in which the baseline is to learn a dictionary accompanied by sparse
codes. While much emphasis is put on discriminative dictionary construction,
there are no comparative studies of sparse codes regarding abnormality
detection. We comprehensively study two types of sparse codes solutions -
greedy algorithms and convex L1-norm solutions - and their impact on
abnormality detection performance. We also propose our framework of combining
sparse codes with different detection methods. Our comparative experiments are
carried out from various angles to better understand the applicability of
sparse codes, including computation time, reconstruction error, sparsity,
detection accuracy, and their performance combining various detection methods.
Experiments show that combining OMP codes with maximum coordinate detection
could achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UCSD dataset [14].
