We propose a couple of oracle construction methods for quantum pattern
matching. We in turn show that one of the construct can be used with the
Grover's search algorithm for exact and partial pattern matching,
deterministically. The other one also points to the matched indices, but
primarily provides a means to generate the Hamming distance between the pattern
to be searched and all the possible sub strings in the input string, in a
probabilistic way.
