Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with sparse input features have been widely used
in recommender systems in industry. These models have large memory requirements
and need a huge amount of training data. The large model size usually entails a
cost, in the range of millions of dollars, for storage and communication with
the inference services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hashing method to
combine frequency hashing and double hashing techniques for model size
reduction, without compromising performance. We evaluate the proposed models on
two product surfaces. In both cases, experiment results demonstrated that we
can reduce the model size by around 90 % while keeping the performance on par
with the original baselines.
