In this work, we present the Large Labelled Logo Dataset (L3D), a
multipurpose, hand-labelled, continuously growing dataset. It is composed of
around 770k of color 256x256 RGB images extracted from the European Union
Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) open registry. Each of them is associated
to multiple labels that classify the figurative and textual elements that
appear in the images. These annotations have been classified by the EUIPO
evaluators using the Vienna classification, a hierarchical classification of
figurative marks. We suggest two direct applications of this dataset, namely,
logo classification and logo generation.
