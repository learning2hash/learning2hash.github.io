Lyra2REv2 is a hashing algorithm that consists of a chain of individual
hashing algorithms and it is used as a proof-of-work function in several
cryptocurrencies that aim to be ASIC-resistant. The most crucial hashing
algorithm in the Lyra2REv2 chain is a specific instance of the general Lyra2
algorithm. In this work we present the first FPGA implementation of the
aforementioned instance of Lyra2 and we explain how several properties of the
algorithm can be exploited in order to optimize the design.
