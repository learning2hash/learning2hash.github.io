We introduce a variant of de Bruijn words that we call perfect necklaces. Fix
a finite alphabet. Recall that a word is a finite sequence of symbols in the
alphabet and a circular word, or necklace, is the equivalence class of a word
under rotations. For positive integers k and n, we call a necklace
(k,n)-perfect if each word of length k occurs exactly n times at positions
which are different modulo n for any convention on the starting point. We call
a necklace perfect if it is (k,k)-perfect for some k. We prove that every
arithmetic sequence with difference coprime with the alphabet size induces a
perfect necklace. In particular, the concatenation of all words of the same
length in lexicographic order yields a perfect necklace. For each k and n, we
give a closed formula for the number of (k,n)-perfect necklaces. Finally, we
prove that every infinite periodic sequence whose period coincides with some
(k,n)-perfect necklace for any n, passes all statistical tests of size up to k,
but not all larger tests. This last theorem motivated this work.
