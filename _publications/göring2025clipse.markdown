A brief overview of CLIPSE, a self-hosted image search engine with the main
application of research, is provided. In general, CLIPSE uses CLIP embeddings
to process the images and also the text queries. The overall framework is
designed with simplicity to enable easy extension and usage. Two benchmark
scenarios are described and evaluated, covering indexing and querying time. It
is shown that CLIPSE is capable of handling smaller datasets; for larger
datasets, a distributed approach with several instances should be considered.
