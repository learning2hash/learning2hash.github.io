This work aims to explore a convolution-free base classifier that can be used
to widen the variations of the conventional ensemble classifier. Specifically,
we propose Vision Transformers as base classifiers to combine with CNNs for a
unique ensemble solution in Kaggle kinship recognition. In this paper, we
verify our proposed idea by implementing and optimizing variants of the Vision
Transformer model on top of the existing CNN models. The combined models
achieve better scores than conventional ensemble classifiers based solely on
CNN variants. We demonstrate that highly optimized CNN ensembles publicly
available on the Kaggle Discussion board can easily achieve a significant boost
in ROC score by simply ensemble with variants of the Vision Transformer model
due to low correlation.
