We consider the task of inferring is-a relationships from large text corpora.
For this purpose, we propose a new method combining hyperbolic embeddings and
Hearst patterns. This approach allows us to set appropriate constraints for
inferring concept hierarchies from distributional contexts while also being
able to predict missing is-a relationships and to correct wrong extractions.
Moreover -- and in contrast with other methods -- the hierarchical nature of
hyperbolic space allows us to learn highly efficient representations and to
improve the taxonomic consistency of the inferred hierarchies. Experimentally,
we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
commonly-used benchmarks.
