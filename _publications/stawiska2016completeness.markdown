We study completeness of the spaces \(\mathcal\{P\}_s^=\) of probability measures
in \(\mathbb\{R\}^N\) which have equal (prescribed) moments up to order \(s \in
\mathbb\{N\}\), endowed with the metric \(d_s(\mu,\nu)=\sup_\{x \in
\mathbb\{R\}^N\setminus 0\}\frac\{|\hat \mu(x)-\hat \nu(x)|\}\{|x|^s\}\), where \(\hat
\mu\) is the characteristic function of \(\mu\). We prove that the spaces
\((\mathcal\{P\}_s^=,d_s)\) are complete if \(s\) is even and construct suitable
counterexamples to completeness for all odd \(s\). This solves an open problem
formulated by J. Carrillo and G. Toscani in 2007.
