In this paper, we introduce the NER dataset from CLUE organization
(CLUENER2020), a well-defined fine-grained dataset for named entity recognition
in Chinese. CLUENER2020 contains 10 categories. Apart from common labels like
person, organization, and location, it contains more diverse categories. It is
more challenging than current other Chinese NER datasets and could better
reflect real-world applications. For comparison, we implement several
state-of-the-art baselines as sequence labeling tasks and report human
performance, as well as its analysis. To facilitate future work on fine-grained
NER for Chinese, we release our dataset, baselines, and leader-board.
