We give bounds on geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold, derived from
new geometric insights. The considered geodesic distances are induced by the
one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021),
which contains the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. First, we give
the best Lipschitz constants between the distances induced by any two members
of the family of metrics. Then, we give a lower and an upper bound on the
geodesic distance by the easily computable Frobenius distance. We give explicit
families of pairs of matrices that depend on the parameter of the metric and
the dimensions of the manifold, where the lower and the upper bound are
attained. These bounds aim at improving the theoretical guarantees and
performance of minimal geodesic computation algorithms by reducing the initial
velocity search space. In addition, these findings contribute to advancing the
understanding of geodesic distances on the Stiefel manifold and their
applications.
