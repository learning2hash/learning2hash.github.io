This technical report describes the training of nomic-embed-vision, a highly
performant, open-code, open-weights image embedding model that shares the same
latent space as nomic-embed-text. Together, nomic-embed-vision and
nomic-embed-text form the first unified latent space to achieve high
performance across vision, language, and multimodal tasks.
