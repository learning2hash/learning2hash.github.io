A method for identifying graphs using MD5 hashing is presented. This allows fast
graph equality comparisons and can also be used to facilitate graph isomorphism
testing. The graphs can be labeled or unlabeled. The method identifies vertices
by hashing the graph configuration in their neighborhoods. With each vertex
hashed, the entire graph can be identified by hashing the vertex hashes.
