A method for identifying graphs using MD5 hashing is presented. This allows
fast graph equality comparisons and can also be used to facilitate graph
isomorphism testing. The graphs can be labeled or unlabeled. The method
identifies vertices by hashing the graph configuration in their neighborhoods.
With each vertex hashed, the entire graph can be identified by hashing the
vertex hashes.
