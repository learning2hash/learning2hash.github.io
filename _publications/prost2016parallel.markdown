Graph clustering is widely used in many data analysis applications. In this
paper we propose several parallel graph clustering algorithms based on Monte
Carlo simulations and expectation maximization in the context of stochastic
block models. We apply those algorithms to the specific problems of recommender
systems and social network anonymization. We compare the experimental results
to previous propositions.
