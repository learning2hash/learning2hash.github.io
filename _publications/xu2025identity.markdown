Clothing-change person re-identification (CC Re-ID) has attracted increasing
attention in recent years due to its application prospect. Most existing works
struggle to adequately extract the ID-related information from the original RGB
images. In this paper, we propose an Identity-aware Feature Decoupling (IFD)
learning framework to mine identity-related features. Particularly, IFD
exploits a dual stream architecture that consists of a main stream and an
attention stream. The attention stream takes the clothing-masked images as
inputs and derives the identity attention weights for effectively transferring
the spatial knowledge to the main stream and highlighting the regions with
abundant identity-related information. To eliminate the semantic gap between
the inputs of two streams, we propose a clothing bias diminishing module
specific to the main stream to regularize the features of clothing-relevant
regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework
outperforms other baseline models on several widely-used CC Re-ID datasets.
