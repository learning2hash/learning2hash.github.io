Contrastive learning techniques have been widely used in the field of
computer vision as a means of augmenting datasets. In this paper, we extend the
use of these contrastive learning embeddings to sentiment analysis tasks and
demonstrate that fine-tuning on these embeddings provides an improvement over
fine-tuning on BERT-based embeddings to achieve higher benchmarks on the task
of sentiment analysis when evaluated on the DynaSent dataset. We also explore
how our fine-tuned models perform on cross-domain benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we explore upsampling techniques to achieve a more balanced class
distribution to make further improvements on our benchmark tasks.
