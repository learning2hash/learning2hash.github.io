This tech report gives an introduction to two annotation toolboxes that
enable the creation of pixel and polygon-based masks as well as bounding boxes
around objects of interest. Both toolboxes support the annotation of sequential
images in the RGB and thermal modalities. Each annotated object is assigned a
classification tag, a unique ID, and one or more optional meta data tags. The
toolboxes are written in C++ with the OpenCV and Qt libraries and are operated
by using the visual interface and the extensive range of keyboard shortcuts.
Pre-built binaries are available for Windows and MacOS and the tools can be
built from source under Linux as well. So far, tens of thousands of frames have
been annotated using the toolboxes.
