Let \(\mu_1 \ge \dotsc \ge \mu_n > 0\) and \(\mu_1 + \dotsm + \mu_n = 1\). Let
\(X_1, \dotsc, X_n\) be independent non-negative random variables with \(EX_1 =
\dotsc = EX_n = 1\), and let \(Z = \sum_\{i=1\}^n \mu_i X_i\). Let \(M = \max_\{1 \le
i \le n\} \mu_i = \mu_1\), and let \(\delta > 0\) and \(T = 1 + \delta\). Both
Samuels and Feige formulated conjectures bounding the probability \(P(Z < T)\)
from above. We prove that Samuels' conjecture implies a conjecture of Feige.
