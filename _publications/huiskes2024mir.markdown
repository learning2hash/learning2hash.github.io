In most well known image retrieval test sets, the imagery
typically cannot be freely distributed or is not representative of a
large community of users. In this paper we present a collection
for the MIR community comprising 25000 images from the Flickr
website which are redistributable for research purposes and
represent a real community of users both in the image content and
image tags. We have extracted the tags and EXIF image metadata,
and also make all of these publicly available. In addition we
discuss several challenges for benchmarking retrieval and
classification methods.
