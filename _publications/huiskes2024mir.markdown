In most well known image retrieval test sets the imagery typically cannot be freely distributed or is not representative of a large community of users. In this paper we present a collection for the MIR community comprising 25000 images from the Flickr website which are redistributable for research purposes and represent a real community of users both in the image content and image tags. We have extracted the tags and EXIF image metadata and also make all of these publicly available. In addition we discuss several challenges for benchmarking retrieval and classification methods.
