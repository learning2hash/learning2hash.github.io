We consider the occupation measure of the cut points of a simple random walk
on a \(d\)-dimensional cubic lattice for \(d = 2, 3\), and we show that the scaling
limit of the occupation measure in weak topology is the natural fractal measure
on the Brownian cut points defined via its Minkowski content.
