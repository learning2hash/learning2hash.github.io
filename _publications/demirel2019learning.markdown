In this work, we propose a zero-shot learning method to effectively model
knowledge transfer between classes via jointly learning visually consistent
word vectors and label embedding model in an end-to-end manner. The main idea
is to project the vector space word vectors of attributes and classes into the
visual space such that word representations of semantically related classes
become more closer, and use the projected vectors in the proposed embedding
model to identify unseen classes. We evaluate the proposed approach on two
benchmark datasets and the experimental results show that our method yields
significant improvements in recognition accuracy.
