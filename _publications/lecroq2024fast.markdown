Computing regularities in strings is essential for a better understanding of their structures. Among regularities, periods and covers are the easiest to compute and the more informative. Lately new interesting string matching results have been achieved using different sampling techniques. One of these technique, called Character-Distance-Sampling (\texttt{CDS}) consists of representing a string by storing the distance between the positions of selected characters called pivots. Here we select as pivots only the first character of the string and use its \texttt{CDS} representation for computing its period and its shortest cover. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are much faster than classical methods for computing these two features.
