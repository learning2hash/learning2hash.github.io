Learning from set45;structured data is an essential problem with many applications in machine learning and computer vision. This paper focuses on non45;parametric and data45;independent learning from set45;structured data using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) solutions particularly locality45;sensitive hashing. We consider the problem of set retrieval from an input set query. Such retrieval problem requires 1) an efficient mechanism to calculate the distances/dissimilarities between sets and 2) an appropriate data structure for fast nearest neighbor search. To that end we propose Sliced45;Wasserstein set embedding as a computationally efficient set45;245;vector mechanism that enables downstream ANN with theoretical guarantees. The set elements are treated as samples from an unknown underlying distribution and the Sliced45;Wasserstein distance is used to compare sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm denoted as Set45;LOcality Sensitive Hashing (SLOSH) on various set retrieval datasets and compare our proposed embedding with standard set embedding approaches including Generalized Mean (GeM) embedding/pooling Featurewise Sort Pooling (FSPool) and Covariance Pooling and show consistent improvement in retrieval results.
