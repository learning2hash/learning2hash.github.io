We define generalized Hamming weights for almost affine codes. We show how
various aspects and applications of generalized Hamming weights for linear
codes, such as Wei duality, generalized Kung's bound, profiles, connection to
wire-tap channels of type II, apply to the larger class of almost affine codes
in general. In addition we discuss duality of almost affine codes,and of the
smaller class of multilinear codes. We also give results about weight
distributions of infinite series of almost affine codes, each series obtained
from a fixed code by extending the code alphabet.
