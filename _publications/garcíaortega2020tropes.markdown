TVTropes is a wiki that describes tropes and which ones are used in which
artistic work. We are mostly interested in films, so after releasing the
TropeScraper Python module that extracts data from this site, in this report we
use scraped information to describe statistically how tropes and films are
related to each other and how these relations evolve in time. In order to do
so, we generated a dataset through the tool TropeScraper in April 2020. We have
compared it to the latest snapshot of DB Tropes, a dataset covering the same
site and published in July 2016, providing descriptive analysis, studying the
fundamental differences and addressing the evolution of the wiki in terms of
the number of tropes, the number of films and connections. The results show
that the number of tropes and films doubled their value and quadrupled their
relations, and films are, at large, better described in terms of tropes.
However, while the types of films with the most tropes has not changed
significantly in years, the list of most popular tropes has. This outcome can
help on shedding some light on how popular tropes evolve, which ones become
more popular or fade away, and in general how a set of tropes represents a film
and might be a key to its success. The dataset generated, the information
extracted, and the summaries provided are useful resources for any research
involving films and tropes. They can provide proper context and explanations
about the behaviour of models built on top of the dataset, including the
generation of new content or its use in machine learning.
