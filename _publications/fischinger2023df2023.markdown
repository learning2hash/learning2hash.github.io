The deliberate manipulation of public opinion, especially through altered
images, which are frequently disseminated through online social networks, poses
a significant danger to society. To fight this issue on a technical level we
support the research community by releasing the Digital Forensics 2023 (DF2023)
training and validation dataset, comprising one million images from four major
forgery categories: splicing, copy-move, enhancement and removal. This dataset
enables an objective comparison of network architectures and can significantly
reduce the time and effort of researchers preparing datasets.
