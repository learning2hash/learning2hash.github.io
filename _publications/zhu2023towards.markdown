Taxonomy expansion task is essential in organizing the ever-increasing volume
of new concepts into existing taxonomies. Most existing methods focus
exclusively on using textual semantics, leading to an inability to generalize
to unseen terms and the "Prototypical Hypernym Problem." In this paper, we
propose Visual Taxonomy Expansion (VTE), introducing visual features into the
taxonomy expansion task. We propose a textual hypernymy learning task and a
visual prototype learning task to cluster textual and visual semantics. In
addition to the tasks on respective modalities, we introduce a hyper-proto
constraint that integrates textual and visual semantics to produce fine-grained
visual semantics. Our method is evaluated on two datasets, where we obtain
compelling results. Specifically, on the Chinese taxonomy dataset, our method
significantly improves accuracy by 8.75 %. Additionally, our approach performs
better than ChatGPT on the Chinese taxonomy dataset.
