With the incredibly growing amount of multimedia data shared on the social
media platforms, recommender systems have become an important necessity to ease
users' burden on the information overload. In such a scenario, extensive amount
of heterogeneous information such as tags, image content, in addition to the
user-to-item preferences, is extremely valuable for making effective
recommendations. In this paper, we explore a novel hybrid algorithm termed \{\em
STM\}, for image recommendation. STM jointly considers the problem of image
content analysis with the users' preferences on the basis of sparse
representation. STM is able to tackle the challenges of highly sparse user
feedbacks and cold-start problmes in the social network scenario. In addition,
our model is based on the classical probabilistic matrix factorization and can
be easily extended to incorporate other useful information such as the social
relationships. We evaluate our approach with a newly collected 0.3 million
social image data set from Flickr. The experimental results demonstrate that
sparse topic modeling of the image content leads to more effective
recommendations, , with a significant performance gain over the
state-of-the-art alternatives.
