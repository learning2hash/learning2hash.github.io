We propose a new decentralized coded caching scheme for a two-phase caching
network, where the data placed in user caches in the prefetching phase are
random portions of a maximal distance separable (MDS) coded version of the
original files. The proposed scheme achieves a better rate memory trade-off by
utilizing the reconstruction property of MDS codes which reduces the number of
transmissions that are useful only for a small subset of users in the delivery
phase. Unlike the previously available coded prefetching schemes, the proposed
scheme does not require to have more users than files. The proposed scheme can
be viewed as a generalization of the original uncoded prefetching based
decentralized coded caching scheme, and likewise, is applicable to various
network topologies.
