The Norman Conquest of 1066 C.E. brought profound transformations to
England's administrative, societal, and linguistic practices. The DEEDS
(Documents of Early England Data Set) database offers a unique opportunity to
explore these changes by examining shifts in word meanings within a vast
collection of Medieval Latin charters. While computational linguistics
typically relies on vector representations of words like static and contextual
embeddings to analyze semantic changes, existing embeddings for scarce and
historical Medieval Latin are limited and may not be well-suited for this task.
This paper presents the first computational analysis of semantic change pre-
and post-Norman Conquest and the first systematic comparison of static and
contextual embeddings in a scarce historical data set. Our findings confirm
that, consistent with existing studies, contextual embeddings outperform static
word embeddings in capturing semantic change within a scarce historical corpus.
