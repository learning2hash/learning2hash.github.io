This paper explores the task of interactive image retrieval using natural
language queries, where a user progressively provides input queries to refine a
set of retrieval results. Moreover, our work explores this problem in the
context of complex image scenes containing multiple objects. We propose
Drill-down, an effective framework for encoding multiple queries with an
efficient compact state representation that significantly extends current
methods for single-round image retrieval. We show that using multiple rounds of
natural language queries as input can be surprisingly effective to find
arbitrarily specific images of complex scenes. Furthermore, we find that
existing image datasets with textual captions can provide a surprisingly
effective form of weak supervision for this task. We compare our method with
existing sequential encoding and embedding networks, demonstrating superior
performance on two proposed benchmarks: automatic image retrieval on a
simulated scenario that uses region captions as queries, and interactive image
retrieval using real queries from human evaluators.
