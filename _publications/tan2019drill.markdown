This paper explores the task of interactive image retrieval using natural language queries where a user progressively provides input queries to refine a set of retrieval results. Moreover our work explores this problem in the context of complex image scenes containing multiple objects. We propose Drill-down an effective framework for encoding multiple queries with an efficient compact state representation that significantly extends current methods for single-round image retrieval. We show that using multiple rounds of natural language queries as input can be surprisingly effective to find arbitrarily specific images of complex scenes. Furthermore we find that existing image datasets with textual captions can provide a surprisingly effective form of weak supervision for this task. We compare our method with existing sequential encoding and embedding networks demonstrating superior performance on two proposed benchmarks automatic image retrieval on a simulated scenario that uses region captions as queries and interactive image retrieval using real queries from human evaluators.
