In this study we propose a new concept of databases (crowdsourced databases),
adding a new conceptual approach to the debate on legal protection of databases
in Europe. We also summarise the current legal framework and current indexing
and web scraping practices - it would not be prudent to suggest a new theory
without contextualising it in the legal and practical context in which it is
developed.
