This work proposes a new method for place recognition based on the scene
architecture. From depth video, we compute the 3D model and we derive and
describe geometrically the 2D map from which the scene descriptor is deduced to
constitute the core of the proposed algorithm. The obtained results show the
efficiency and the robustness of the propounded descriptor to scene appearance
changes and light variations.
