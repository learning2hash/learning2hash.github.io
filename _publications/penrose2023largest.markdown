Let \(X_1,X_2, \ldots \) be independent identically distributed random points
in a convex polytopal domain \(A \subset \mathbb\{R\}^d\). Define the largest
nearest neighbour link \(L_n\) to be the smallest \(r\) such that every point of
\(\mathcal X_n:=\\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\\}\) has another such point within distance \(r\).
We obtain a strong law of large numbers for \(L_n\) in the large-\(n\) limit. A
related threshold, the connectivity threshold \(M_n\), is the smallest \(r\) such
that the random geometric graph \(G(\mathcal X_n, r)\) is connected. We show that
as \(n \to \infty\), almost surely \(nL_n^d/log n\) tends to a limit that depends
on the geometry of \(A\), and \(nM_n^d/log n\) tends to the same limit.
