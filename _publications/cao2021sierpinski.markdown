We construct a Sierpinski carpet like fractal, on which a self-similar
diffusion with sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimate does not exist, in contrast to
previous researches on the existence of such diffusions, on the generalized
Sierpinski carpets and recently introduced unconstrained Sierpinski carpets.
