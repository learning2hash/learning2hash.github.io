We introduce GSimCNN (Graph Similarity Computation via Convolutional Neural
Networks) for predicting the similarity score between two graphs. As the core
operation of graph similarity search, pairwise graph similarity computation is
a challenging problem due to the NP-hard nature of computing many graph
distance/similarity metrics. We demonstrate our model using the Graph Edit
Distance (GED) as the example metric. Experiments on three real graph datasets
demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on graph
similarity search.
