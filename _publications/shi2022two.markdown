The purpose of this paper is to solve the two conjectures on the largest
minimum distance \\(d_\{so\}(n,5)\\) of a binary self-orthogonal \\([n,5]\\) code
proposed by Kim and Choi (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2022). The determination of
\\(d_\{so\}(n,k)\\) has been a fundamental and difficult problem in coding theory
because there are too many binary self-orthogonal codes as the dimension \\(k\\)
increases. Recently, Kim et al. (2021) considered the shortest self-orthogonal
embedding of a binary linear code, and many binary optimal self-orthogonal
\\([n,k]\\) codes were constructed for \\(k=4,5\\). Kim and Choi (2022) improved some
results of Kim et al. (2021) and made two conjectures on \\(d_\{so\}(n,5)\\). In this
paper, we develop a general method to determine the exact value of
\\(d_\{so\}(n,k)\\) for \\(k=5,6\\) and show that the two conjectures made by Kim and
Choi (2022) are true.
