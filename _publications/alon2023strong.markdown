A strong blocking set in a finite projective space is a set of points that
intersects each hyperplane in a spanning set. We provide a new graph theoretic
construction of such sets: combining constant-degree expanders with
asymptotically good codes, we explicitly construct strong blocking sets in the
\\((k-1)\\)-dimensional projective space over \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q\\) that have size \\(O( q k
)\\). Since strong blocking sets have recently been shown to be equivalent to
minimal linear codes, our construction gives the first explicit construction of
\\(\mathbb\{F\}_q\\)-linear minimal codes of length \\(n\\) and dimension \\(k\\), for every
prime power \\(q\\), for which \\(n = O (q k)\\). This solves one of the main open
problems on minimal codes.
