Consider a centralized caching network with a single server and \(K\) users.
The server has a database of \(N\) files with each file being divided into \(F\)
packets (\(F\) is known as subpacketization), and each user owns a local cache
that can store \(\frac\{M\}\{N\}\) fraction of the \(N\) files. We construct a family
of centralized coded caching schemes with polynomial subpacketization.
Specifically, given \(M\), \(N\) and an integer \(n\geq 0\), we construct a family of
coded caching schemes for any \((K,M,N)\) caching system with \(F=O(K^\{n+1\})\).
More generally, for any \(t\in\\{1,2,\cdots,K-2\\}\) and any integer \(n\) such that
\(0\leq n\leq t\), we construct a coded caching scheme with
\(\frac\{M\}\{N\}=\frac\{t\}\{K\}\) and \(F\leq
K\binom\{\left(1-\frac\{M\}\{N\}\right)K+n\}\{n\}\).
