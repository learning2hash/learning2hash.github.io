Hosting platforms for software projects can form collaborative social
networks and a prime example of this is GitHub which is arguably the most
popular platform of this kind. An open source project recommendation system
could be a major feature for a platform like GitHub, enabling its users to find
relevant projects in a fast and simple manner. We perform network analysis on a
constructed graph based on GitHub data and present a recommendation system that
uses link prediction.
