Subspace data representation has recently become a common practice in many
computer vision tasks. It demands generalizing classical machine learning
algorithms for subspace data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is one of the most
successful models for clustering vectorial data according to their subspace
structures. This paper explores the possibility of extending LRR for subspace
data on Grassmann manifolds. Rather than directly embedding the Grassmann
manifolds into the symmetric matrix space, an extrinsic view is taken to build
the LRR self-representation in the local area of the tangent space at each
Grassmannian point, resulting in a localized LRR method on Grassmann manifolds.
A novel algorithm for solving the proposed model is investigated and
implemented. The performance of the new clustering algorithm is assessed
through experiments on several real-world datasets including MNIST handwritten
digits, ballet video clips, SKIG action clips, DynTex++ dataset and highway
traffic video clips. The experimental results show the new method outperforms a
number of state-of-the-art clustering methods
