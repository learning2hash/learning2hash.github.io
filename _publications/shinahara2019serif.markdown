In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of font statistics in book
covers and online advertisements. Through the statistical study, we try to
understand how graphic designers relate fonts and content genres and identify
the relationship between font styles, colors, and genres. We propose an
automatic approach to extract font information from graphic designs by applying
a sequence of character detection, style classification, and clustering
techniques to the graphic designs. The extracted font information is
accumulated together with genre information, such as romance or business, for
further trend analysis. Through our unique empirical study, we show that the
collected font statistics reveal interesting trends in terms of how typographic
design represents the impression and the atmosphere of the content genres.
