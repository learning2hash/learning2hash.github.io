Sparse coding with dictionary learning (DL) has shown excellent
classification performance. Despite the considerable number of existing works,
how to obtain features on top of which dictionaries can be better learned
remains an open and interesting question. Many current prevailing DL methods
directly adopt well-performing crafted features. While such strategy may
empirically work well, it ignores certain intrinsic relationship between
dictionaries and features. We propose a framework where features and
dictionaries are jointly learned and optimized. The framework, named joint
non-negative projection and dictionary learning (JNPDL), enables interaction
between the input features and the dictionaries. The non-negative projection
leads to discriminative parts-based object features while DL seeks a more
suitable representation. Discriminative graph constraints are further imposed
to simultaneously maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Experiments on both image and image set classification show the
excellent performance of JNPDL by outperforming several state-of-the-art
approaches.
