A Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH) function is called \\((r,cr,p_1,p_2)\\)-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than \\(r\\) collide with probability at least \\(p_1\\) while data points with a distance greater than \\(cr\\) collide with probability at most \\(p_2\\). These functions form the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest neighbour problems. In particular one may build a \\(c\\)-approximate nearest neighbour data structure with query time \\(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1)\\) where \\(\rho=\frac{\log1/p_1}{\log1/p_2}\in(0,1)\\). That is, sub-linear time, as long as \\(p_1\\) is not too small. This is significant since most high dimensional nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can't be solved exact, faster than a brute force linear-time scan of the database. Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision probabilities, \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Including the best functions for Cosine and Jaccard Similarity. This means that the \\(n^\rho/p_1\\) query time of LSH is often not sub-linear after all, even for approximate nearest neighbours! In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the query time of LSH to \\(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1^{1-\rho})\\) (and the space usage correspondingly.) Since \\(n^\rho p_1^{\rho-1} < n \Leftrightarrow p_1 > n^{-1}\\), our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision probabilities at least \\(1/n\\). For \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) small enough, our improvement over all previous methods can be \emph\{up to a factor \\(n\\)\} in both query time and space. The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm, which can easily be implemented in existing software packages.
