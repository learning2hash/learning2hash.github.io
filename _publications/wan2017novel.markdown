This paper proposes a novel achievable scheme for the index problem and
applies it to the caching problem. Index coding and caching are noiseless
broadcast channel problems where receivers have message side information.In the
index coding problem the side information sets are fixed, while in the caching
problem the side information sets correspond the cache contents, which are
under the control of the system designer. The proposed index coding scheme,
based on distributed source coding and non-unique decoding,is shown to strictly
enlarge the rate region achievable by composite coding.The novel index coding
scheme applied to the caching problem is then shown to match an outer bound
(previously proposed by the authors and also based on known results for the
index coding problem) under the assumption of uncoded cache
placement/prefetching.
