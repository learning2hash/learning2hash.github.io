The French TreeBank developed at the University Paris 7 is the main source of
morphosyntactic and syntactic annotations for French. However, it does not
include explicit information related to named entities, which are among the
most useful information for several natural language processing tasks and
applications. Moreover, no large-scale French corpus with named entity
annotations contain referential information, which complement the type and the
span of each mention with an indication of the entity it refers to. We have
manually annotated the French TreeBank with such information, after an
automatic pre-annotation step. We sketch the underlying annotation guidelines
and we provide a few figures about the resulting annotations.
