In this paper, a system for facial recognition to identify missing and found
people in Hajj and Umrah is described as a web portal. Explicitly, we present a
novel algorithm for recognition and classifications of facial images based on
applying 2DPCA to a 2D representation of the Histogram of oriented gradients
(2D-HOG) which maintains the spatial relation between pixels of the input
images. This algorithm allows a compact representation of the images which
reduces the computational complexity and the storage requirments, while
maintaining the highest reported recognition accuracy. This promotes this
method for usage with very large datasets. Large dataset was collected for
people in Hajj. Experimental results employing ORL, UMIST, JAFFE, and HAJJ
datasets confirm these excellent properties.
