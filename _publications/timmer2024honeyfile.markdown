Honeyfiles are a particularly useful type of honeypot: fake files deployed to
detect and infer information from malicious behaviour. This paper considers the
challenge of naming honeyfiles so they are camouflaged when placed amongst real
files in a file system. Based on cosine distances in semantic vector spaces, we
develop two metrics for filename camouflage: one based on simple averaging and
one on clustering with mixture fitting. We evaluate and compare the metrics,
showing that both perform well on a publicly available GitHub software
repository dataset.
