We model the one-dimensional `classical' vacuum by a system of annihilating
Brownian motions on \(\mathbb\{R\}\) with pairwise immigration. A pair of
reflecting or absorbing walls placed in such a vacuum at separation \(L\)
experiences an attractive force which decays exponentially with \(L\). This
phenomenon can be regarded as a purely classical Casimir effect for a system of
interacting Brownian motions.
