We present a probabilistic model for Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR)
where, at retrieval time, we are given sketches from novel classes, that were
not present at training time. Existing SBIR methods, most of which rely on
learning class-wise correspondences between sketches and images, typically work
well only for previously seen sketch classes, and result in poor retrieval
performance on novel classes. To address this, we propose a generative model
that learns to generate images, conditioned on a given novel class sketch. This
enables us to reduce the SBIR problem to a standard image-to-image search
problem. Our model is based on an inverse auto-regressive flow based
variational autoencoder, with a feedback mechanism to ensure robust image
generation. We evaluate our model on two very challenging datasets, Sketchy,
and TU Berlin, with novel train-test split. The proposed approach significantly
outperforms various baselines on both the datasets.
