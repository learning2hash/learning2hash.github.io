We briefly survey some concepts related to empirical entropy -- normal
numbers, de Bruijn sequences and Markov processes -- and investigate how well
it approximates Kolmogorov complexity. Our results suggest \\(\ell\\)th-order
empirical entropy stops being a reasonable complexity metric for almost all
strings of length \\(m\\) over alphabets of size \\(n\\) about when \\(n^\ell\\) surpasses
\\(m\\).
