Most design approaches for trellis-coded quantization take advantage of the duality of trellis-coded quantization with trellis-coded modulation and use the same empirically-found convolutional codes to label the trellis branches. This letter presents an alternative approach that instead takes advantage of maximum-Hamming-distance convolutional codes. The proposed source codes are shown to be competitive with the best in the literature for the same computational complexity.
