In this paper, we propose a new word embedding based corpus consisting of
more than 61 million words crawled from multiple web resources. We design a
preprocessing pipeline for the filtration of unwanted text from crawled data.
Afterwards, the cleaned vocabulary is fed to state-of-the-art
continuous-bag-of-words, skip-gram, and GloVe word embedding algorithms. For
the evaluation of pretrained embeddings, we use popular intrinsic and extrinsic
evaluation approaches. The evaluation results reveal that
continuous-bag-of-words and skip-gram perform better than GloVe and existing
Sindhi fastText word embedding on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation
approaches
