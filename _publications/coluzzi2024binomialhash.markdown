Consistent hashing is employed in distributed systems and networking applications to evenly and effectively distribute data across a cluster of nodes. This paper introduces BinomialHash, a consistent hashing algorithm that operates in constant time and requires minimal memory. We provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm, offer a pseudo-code implementation, and formally establish its strong theoretical guarantees.
