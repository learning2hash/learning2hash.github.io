In this paper, we theoretically propose a new hashing scheme to establish the
sparse Fourier transform in high-dimensional space. The estimation of the
algorithm complexity shows that this sparse Fourier transform can overcome the
curse of dimensionality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
polynomial-time algorithm to recover the high-dimensional continuous
frequencies.
