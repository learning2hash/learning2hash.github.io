<p>Consistent hashing (CH) has been pivotal as a data router and load
balancer in diverse fields, including distributed databases, cloud
infrastructure, and peer-to-peer networks. However, existing CH
algorithms often fall short in simultaneously meeting various critical
requirements, such as load balance, minimal disruption, statelessness,
high lookup rate, small memory footprint, and low update overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce DxHash, a scalable consistent
hashing algorithm based on pseudo-random sequences. To adjust workloads
on heterogeneous nodes and enhance flexibility, we propose weighted
DxHash. Through comprehensive evaluations, DxHash demonstrates
substantial improvements across all six requirements compared to
state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, even when confronted with a 50%
failure ratio in a cluster of one million nodes, DxHash maintains
remarkable processing capabilities, handling up to 13.3 million queries
per second.</p>
