Open data is an important basis for open science and evidence-based
policymaking. Governments of many countries disclose government-related
statistics as open data. Some of these data are provided as CSV files. However,
since CSV files are plain texts, we cannot ensure the integrity of a downloaded
CSV file. A popular way to prove the data's integrity is a digital signature;
however, it is difficult to embed a signature into a CSV file. This paper
proposes a method for embedding a digital signature into a CSV file using a
data hiding technique. The proposed method exploits a redundancy of the CSV
format related to the use of double quotes. The experiment revealed we could
embed a 512-bit signature into actual open data CSV files.
