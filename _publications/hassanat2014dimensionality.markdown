This paper presents a new similarity measure to be used for general tasks
including supervised learning, which is represented by the K-nearest neighbor
classifier (KNN). The proposed similarity measure is invariant to large
differences in some dimensions in the feature space. The proposed metric is
proved mathematically to be a metric. To test its viability for different
applications, the KNN used the proposed metric for classifying test examples
chosen from a number of real datasets. Compared to some other well known
metrics, the experimental results show that the proposed metric is a promising
distance measure for the KNN classifier with strong potential for a wide range
of applications.
