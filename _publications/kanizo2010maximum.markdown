Cuckoo hashing with a stash is a robust multiple choice hashing scheme with high memory utilization that can be used in many network device applications. Unfortunately, for memory loads beyond 0.5, little is known on its performance. In this paper, we analyze its average performance over such loads. We tackle this problem by recasting the problem as an analysis of the expected maximum matching size of a given random bipartite graph. We provide exact results for any finite system, and also deduce asymptotic results as the memory size increases. We further consider other variants of this problem, and finally evaluate the performance of our models on Internet backbone traces. More generally, our results give a tight lower bound on the size of the stash needed for any multiple-choice hashing scheme.
