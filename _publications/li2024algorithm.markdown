Let \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_s\) and \(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t\) be strings over an alphabet
\(\Sigma\), where \(s\) and \(t\) are positive integers. The longest common
subsequence and substring problem for multiple strings \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_s\) and
\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t\) is to find the longest string which is a subsequence of
\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_s\) and a substring of \(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t\). In this paper, we
propose an algorithm to solve the problem.
