This chapter provides an overview of the problems that need to be dealt with
when constructing a lifelong-learning retrieval, recognition and indexing
engine for large historical document collections in multiple scripts and
languages, the Monk system. This application is highly variable over time,
since the continuous labeling by end users changes the concept of what a
'ground truth' constitutes. Although current advances in deep learning provide
a huge potential in this application domain, the scale of the problem, i.e.,
more than 520 hugely diverse books, documents and manuscripts precludes the
current meticulous and painstaking human effort which is required in designing
and developing successful deep-learning systems. The ball-park principle is
introduced, which describes the evolution from the sparsely-labeled stage that
can only be addressed by traditional methods or nearest-neighbor methods on
embedded vectors of pre-trained neural networks, up to the other end of the
spectrum where massive labeling allows reliable training of deep-learning
methods. Contents: Introduction, Expectation management, Deep learning, The
ball-park principle, Technical realization, Work flow, Quality and quantity of
