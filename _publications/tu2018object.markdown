Recently similarity45;preserving hashing methods have been extensively studied for large45;scale image retrieval. Compared with unsupervised hashing supervised hashing methods for labeled data have usually better performance by utilizing semantic label information. Intuitively for unlabeled data it will improve the performance of unsupervised hashing methods if we can first mine some supervised semantic label information from unlabeled data and then incorporate the label information into the training process. Thus in this paper we propose a novel Object Detection based Deep Unsupervised Hashing method (ODDUH). Specifically a pre45;trained object detection model is utilized to mining supervised label information which is used to guide the learning process to generate high45;quality hash codes.Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art unsupervised hashing methods in the image retrieval task.
