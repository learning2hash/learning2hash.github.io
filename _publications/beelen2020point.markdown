In this article, we consider the decoding problem of Grassmann codes using
majority logic. We show that for two points of the Grassmannian, there exists a
canonical path between these points once a complete flag is fixed. These paths
are used to construct a large set of parity checks orthogonal on a coordinate
of the code, resulting in a majority decoding algorithm.
