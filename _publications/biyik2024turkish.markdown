Euphemisms are a form of figurative language relatively understudied in
natural language processing. This research extends the current computational
work on potentially euphemistic terms (PETs) to Turkish. We introduce the
Turkish PET dataset, the first available of its kind in the field. By creating
a list of euphemisms in Turkish, collecting example contexts, and annotating
them, we provide both euphemistic and non-euphemistic examples of PETs in
Turkish. We describe the dataset and methodologies, and also experiment with
transformer-based models on Turkish euphemism detection by using our dataset
for binary classification. We compare performances across models using F1,
accuracy, and precision as evaluation metrics.
