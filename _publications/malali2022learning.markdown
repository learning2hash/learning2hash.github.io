We present a deep learning approach for learning the joint semantic
embeddings of images and captions in a Euclidean space, such that the semantic
similarity is approximated by the L2 distances in the embedding space. For
that, we introduce a metric learning scheme that utilizes multitask learning to
learn the embedding of identical semantic concepts using a center loss. By
introducing a differentiable quantization scheme into the end-to-end trainable
network, we derive a semantic embedding of semantically similar concepts in
Euclidean space. We also propose a novel metric learning formulation using an
adaptive margin hinge loss, that is refined during the training phase. The
proposed scheme was applied to the MS-COCO, Flicke30K and Flickr8K datasets,
and was shown to compare favorably with contemporary state-of-the-art
approaches.
