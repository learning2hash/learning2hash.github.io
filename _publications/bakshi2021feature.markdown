Three popular feature descriptors of computer vision such as SIFT, SURF, and
ORB compared and evaluated. The number of correct features extracted and
matched for the original hand hygiene pose-Rub hands palm to palm image and
rotated image. An accuracy score calculated based on the total number of
matches and the correct number of matches produced. The experiment demonstrated
that ORB algorithm outperforms by giving the high number of correct matches in
less amount of time. ORB feature detection technique applied over handwashing
video recordings for feature extraction and hand hygiene pose classification as
a future work. OpenCV utilized to apply the algorithms within python scripts.
