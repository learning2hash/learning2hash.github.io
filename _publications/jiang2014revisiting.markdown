We present a simple but powerful reinterpretation of kernelized locality-sensitive hashing (KLSH) a general and popular method developed in the vision community for performing approximate nearest-neighbor searches in an arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Our new perspective is based on viewing the steps of the KLSH algorithm in an appropriately projected space and has several key theoretical and practical benefits. First it eliminates the problematic conceptual difficulties that are present in the existing motivation of KLSH. Second it yields the first formal retrieval performance bounds for KLSH. Third our analysis reveals two techniques for boosting the empirical performance of KLSH. We evaluate these extensions on several large-scale benchmark image retrieval data sets and show that our analysis leads to improved recall performance of at least 1237; and sometimes much higher over the standard KLSH method.
