Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting social signals from social media
content. Due to the prevalence of images in social media, image sentiment
analysis is receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, most
existing systems are black-boxes that do not provide insight on how image
content invokes sentiment and emotion in the viewers. Psychological studies
have confirmed that salient objects in an image often invoke emotions. In this
work, we investigate more fine-grained and more comprehensive interaction
between visual saliency and visual sentiment. In particular, we partition
images in several primary scene-type dimensions, including: open-closed,
natural-manmade, indoor-outdoor, and face-noface. Using state of the art
saliency detection algorithm and sentiment classification algorithm, we examine
how the sentiment of the salient region(s) in an image relates to the overall
sentiment of the image. The experiments on a representative image emotion
dataset have shown interesting correlation between saliency and sentiment in
different scene types and in turn shed light on the mechanism of visual
sentiment evocation.
