In this paper we present a new problem, the fast set intersection problem,
which is to preprocess a collection of sets in order to efficiently report the
intersection of any two sets in the collection. In addition we suggest new
solutions for the two-dimensional substring indexing problem and the document
listing problem for two patterns by reduction to the fast set intersection
problem.
