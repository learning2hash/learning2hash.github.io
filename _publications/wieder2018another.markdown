We show a new proof for the load of obtained by a Cuckoo Hashing data
structure. Our proof is arguably simpler than previous proofs and allows for
new generalizations. The proof first appeared in Pinkas et. al. \cite\{PSWW19\}
in the context of a protocol for private set intersection. We present it here
separately to improve its readability.
