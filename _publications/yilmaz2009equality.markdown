We consider large deviations for nearest-neighbor random walk in a uniformly
elliptic i.i.d. environment. It is easy to see that the quenched and the
averaged rate functions are not identically equal. When the dimension is at
least four and Sznitman's transience condition (T) is satisfied, we prove that
these rate functions are finite and equal on a closed set whose interior
contains every nonzero velocity at which the rate functions vanish.
