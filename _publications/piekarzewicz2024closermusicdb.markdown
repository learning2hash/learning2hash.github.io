In this paper, we introduce CloserMusicDB, a collection of full length studio
quality tracks annotated by a team of human experts. We describe the selected
qualities of our dataset, along with three example tasks possible to perform
using this dataset: hook detection, contextual tagging and artist
identification. We conduct baseline experiments and provide initial benchmarks
for these tasks.
