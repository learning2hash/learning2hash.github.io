<p>A <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-collision for a compressing
hash function <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a set of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> distinct inputs that all map to the
same output. In this work, we show that for any constant <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta\left(N^{\frac{1}{2}(1-\frac{1}{2^k-1})}\right)\)</span>
quantum queries are both necessary and sufficient to achieve a <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-collision with constant probability.
This improves on both the best prior upper bound (Hosoyamada et al.,
ASIACRYPT 2017) and provides the first non-trivial lower bound,
completely resolving the problem.</p>
