A \(k\)-collision for a compressing hash function \(H\) is a set of \(k\) distinct inputs that all map to the same output. In this work, we show that for any constant \(k\), \(\Theta\left(N^\{\frac\{1\}\{2\}(1-\frac\{1\}\{2^k-1\})\}\right)\) quantum queries are both necessary and sufficient to achieve a \(k\)-collision with constant probability. This improves on both the best prior upper bound (Hosoyamada et al., ASIACRYPT 2017) and provides the first non-trivial lower bound, completely resolving the problem.
