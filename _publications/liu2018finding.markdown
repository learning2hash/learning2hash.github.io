A \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-collision for a compressing hash function \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(H\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is a set of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} distinct inputs that all map to the same output. In this work, we show that for any constant \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\Theta\left(N^\{\frac\{1\}\{2\}(1-\frac\{1\}\{2^k-1\})\}\right)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} quantum queries are both necessary and sufficient to achieve a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-collision with constant probability. This improves on both the best prior upper bound (Hosoyamada et al., ASIACRYPT 2017) and provides the first non-trivial lower bound, completely resolving the problem.
