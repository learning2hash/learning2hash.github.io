We address the challenge of Small Object Image Retrieval (SoIR), where the
goal is to retrieve images containing a specific small object, in a cluttered
scene. The key challenge in this setting is constructing a single image
descriptor, for scalable and efficient search, that effectively represents all
objects in the image. In this paper, we first analyze the limitations of
existing methods on this challenging task and then introduce new benchmarks to
support SoIR evaluation. Next, we introduce Multi-object Attention Optimization
(MaO), a novel retrieval framework which incorporates a dedicated multi-object
pre-training phase. This is followed by a refinement process that leverages
attention-based feature extraction with object masks, integrating them into a
single unified image descriptor. Our MaO approach significantly outperforms
existing retrieval methods and strong baselines, achieving notable improvements
in both zero-shot and lightweight multi-object fine-tuning. We hope this work
will lay the groundwork and inspire further research to enhance retrieval
performance for this highly practical task.
