How can we tell whether an image has been mirrored? While we understand the
geometry of mirror reflections very well, less has been said about how it
affects distributions of imagery at scale, despite widespread use for data
augmentation in computer vision. In this paper, we investigate how the
statistics of visual data are changed by reflection. We refer to these changes
as "visual chirality", after the concept of geometric chirality - the notion of
objects that are distinct from their mirror image. Our analysis of visual
chirality reveals surprising results, including low-level chiral signals
pervading imagery stemming from image processing in cameras, to the ability to
discover visual chirality in images of people and faces. Our work has
implications for data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and image
forensics.
