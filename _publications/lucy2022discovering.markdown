A common paradigm for identifying semantic differences across social and
temporal contexts is the use of static word embeddings and their distances. In
particular, past work has compared embeddings against "semantic axes" that
represent two opposing concepts. We extend this paradigm to BERT embeddings,
and construct contextualized axes that mitigate the pitfall where antonyms have
neighboring representations. We validate and demonstrate these axes on two
people-centric datasets: occupations from Wikipedia, and multi-platform
discussions in extremist, men's communities over fourteen years. In both
studies, contextualized semantic axes can characterize differences among
instances of the same word type. In the latter study, we show that references
to women and the contexts around them have become more detestable over time.
