We propose and analyze a novel framework for learning sparse representations,
based on two statistical techniques: kernel smoothing and marginal regression.
The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incorporating feature
similarity or temporal information present in data sets, via non-parametric
kernel smoothing. We provide generalization bounds for dictionary learning
using smooth sparse coding and show how the sample complexity depends on the L1
norm of kernel function used. Furthermore, we propose using marginal regression
for obtaining sparse codes, which significantly improves the speed and allows
one to scale to large dictionary sizes easily. We demonstrate the advantages of
the proposed approach, both in terms of accuracy and speed by extensive
experimentation on several real data sets. In addition, we demonstrate how the
proposed approach could be used for improving semi-supervised sparse coding.
