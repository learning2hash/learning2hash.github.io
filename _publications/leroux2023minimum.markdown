Let \(\mu\) be a probability distribution on \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) which assigns
measure zero to every hyperplane and \(S\) a set of points sampled independently
from \(\mu\). What can be said about the expected combinatorial structure of the
convex hull of \(S\)? These polytopes are simplicial with probability one, but
not much else is known except when more restrictive assumptions are imposed on
\(\mu\). In this paper we show that, with probability close to one, the convex
hull of \(S\) has a high degree of neighborliness no matter the underlying
distribution \(\mu\) as long as \(n\) is not much bigger than \(d\). As a concrete
example, our result implies that if for each \(d\) in \(\mathbb\{N\}\) we choose a
probability distribution \(\mu_d\) on \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) which assigns measure zero
to every hyperplane and then set \(P_n\) to be the convex hull of an i.i.d.
sample of \(n \le 5d/4\) random points from \(\mu_d\), the probability that \(P_n\)
is \(k\)-neighborly approaches one as \(d \to \infty\) for all \(k\le d/20\). We also
give a simple example of a family of distributions which essentially attain our
lower bound on the \(k\)-neighborliness of a random polytope.
