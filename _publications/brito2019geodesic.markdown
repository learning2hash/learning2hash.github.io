We study first passage percolation on the plane for a family of invariant,
ergodic measures on \\(\mathbb\{Z\}^2\\). We prove that for all of these models the
asymptotic shape is the \\(\ell\\)-\\(1\\) ball and that there are exactly four
infinite geodesics starting at the origin a.s. In addition we determine the
exponents for the variance and wandering of finite geodesics. We show that the
variance and wandering exponents do not satisfy the relationship of
\\(\chi=2\xi-1\\) which is expected for independent first passage percolation.
