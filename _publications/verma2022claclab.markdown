This paper summarizes the CLaC submission for SMM4H 2022 Task 10 which
concerns the recognition of diseases mentioned in Spanish tweets. Before
classifying each token, we encode each token with a transformer encoder using
features from Multilingual RoBERTa Large, UMLS gazetteer, and DISTEMIST
gazetteer, among others. We obtain a strict F1 score of 0.869, with competition
mean of 0.675, standard deviation of 0.245, and median of 0.761.
