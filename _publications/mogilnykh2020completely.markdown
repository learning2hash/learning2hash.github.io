Let L be a Desarguesian 2-spread in the Grassmann graph \\(J_q(n,2)\\). We prove
that the collection of the 4-subspaces, which do not contain subspaces from L
is a completely regular code in \\(J_q(n,4)\\). Similarly, we construct a
completely regular code in the Johnson graph \\(J(n,6)\\) from the Steiner
quadruple system of the extended Hamming code. We obtain several new completely
regular codes covering radius 1 in the Grassmann graph \\(J_2(6,3)\\) using binary
linear programming.
