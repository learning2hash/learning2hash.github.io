Anonymity is one of the most important qualities of blockchain technology.
For example, one can simply create a bitcoin address to send and receive funds
without providing KYC to any authority. In general, the real identity behind
cryptocurrency addresses is not known, however, some addresses can be clustered
according to their ownership by analyzing behavioral patterns, allowing those
with known attribution to be assigned labels. These labels may be further used
for legal and compliance purposes to assist in law enforcement investigations.
In this document, we discuss our methodology behind assigning attribution
labels to cryptocurrency addresses.
