This work presents a content-based recommender system for machine learning
classifier algorithms. Given a new data set, a recommendation of what
classifier is likely to perform best is made based on classifier performance
over similar known data sets. This similarity is measured according to a data
set characterization that includes several state-of-the-art metrics taking into
account physical structure, statis- tics, and information theory. A novelty
with respect to prior work is the use of a robust approach based on permutation
tests to directly assess whether a given learning algorithm is able to exploit
the attributes in a data set to predict class labels, and compare it to the
more commonly used F-score metric for evalu- ating classifier performance. To
evaluate our approach, we have conducted an extensive experimentation including
8 of the main machine learning classification methods with varying
configurations and 65 bi- nary data sets, leading to over 2331 experiments. Our
results show that using the information from the permutation test clearly
improves the quality of the recommendations.
