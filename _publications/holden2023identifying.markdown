We introduce and analyse a family of hash and predicate functions that are more likely to produce collisions for small reducible configurations of vectors. These may offer practical improvements to lattice sieving for short vectors. In particular, in one asymptotic regime the family exhibits significantly different convergent behaviour than existing hash functions and predicates.
