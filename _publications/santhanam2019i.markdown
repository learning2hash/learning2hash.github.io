We study how emojis are used to express solidarity in social media in the
context of two major crisis events - a natural disaster, Hurricane Irma in 2017
and terrorist attacks that occurred on November 2015 in Paris. Using annotated
corpora, we first train a recurrent neural network model to classify
expressions of solidarity in text. Next, we use these expressions of solidarity
to characterize human behavior in online social networks, through the temporal
and geospatial diffusion of emojis. Our analysis reveals that emojis are a
powerful indicator of sociolinguistic behaviors (solidarity) that are exhibited
on social media as the crisis events unfold.
