In product search, the retrieval of candidate products before re-ranking is
more critical and challenging than other search like web search, especially for
tail queries, which have a complex and specific search intent. In this paper,
we present a hybrid system for e-commerce search deployed at Walmart that
combines traditional inverted index and embedding-based neural retrieval to
better answer user tail queries. Our system significantly improved the
relevance of the search engine, measured by both offline and online
evaluations. The improvements were achieved through a combination of different
approaches. We present a new technique to train the neural model at scale. and
describe how the system was deployed in production with little impact on
response time. We highlight multiple learnings and practical tricks that were
used in the deployment of this system.
