<p>We study embedding a subset <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of
the unit sphere to the Hamming cube <span
class="math inline">\(\{-1,+1\}^m\)</span>. We characterize the tradeoff
between distortion and sample complexity <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in terms of the Gaussian width <span
class="math inline">\(\omega(K)\)</span> of the set. For subspaces and
several structured sets we show that Gaussian maps provide the optimal
tradeoff <span class="math inline">\(m\sim
\delta^{-2}\omega^2(K)\)</span>, in particular for <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> distortion one needs <span
class="math inline">\(m\approx\delta^{-2}{d}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the subspace dimension. For general
sets, we provide sharp characterizations which reduces to <span
class="math inline">\(m\approx{\delta^{-4}}{\omega^2(K)}\)</span> after
simplification. We provide improved results for local embedding of
points that are in close proximity of each other which is related to
locality sensitive hashing. We also discuss faster binary embedding
where one takes advantage of an initial sketching procedure based on
Fast Johnson-Lindenstauss Transform. Finally, we list several numerical
observations and discuss open problems.</p>
