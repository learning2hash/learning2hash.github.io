We study embedding a subset (K) of the unit sphere to the Hamming cube (-1+1^m). We characterize the tradeoff between distortion and sample complexity (m) in terms of the Gaussian width (omega(K)) of the set. For subspaces and several structured sets we show that Gaussian maps provide the optimal tradeoff (msim delta^-2omega^2(K)) in particular for (delta) distortion one needs (mapproxdelta^-2d) where (d) is the subspace dimension. For general sets we provide sharp characterizations which reduces to (momega^2(K)) after simplification. We provide improved results for local embedding of points that are in close proximity of each other which is related to locality sensitive hashing. We also discuss faster binary embedding where one takes advantage of an initial sketching procedure based on Fast Johnson-Lindenstauss Transform. Finally we list several numerical observations and discuss open problems.
