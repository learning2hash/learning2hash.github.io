DNA code design aims to generate a set of DNA sequences (codewords) with
minimum likelihood of undesired hybridizations among sequences and their
reverse-complement (RC) pairs (cross-hybridization). Inspired by the distinct
hybridization affinities (or stabilities) of perfect double helix constructed
by individual single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and its RC pair, we propose a novel
similarity significance (SS) model to measure the similarity between DNA
sequences. Particularly, instead of directly measuring the similarity of two
sequences by any metric/approach, the proposed SS works in a way to evaluate
how more likely will the undesirable hybridizations occur over the desirable
hybridizations in the presence of the two measured sequences and their RC
pairs. With this SS model, we construct thermodynamically stable DNA codes
subject to several combinatorial constraints using a sorting-based algorithm.
The proposed scheme results in DNA codes with larger code sizes and wider free
energy gaps (hence better cross-hybridization performance) compared to the
existing methods.
