Dimension reduction is a key algorithmic tool with many applications including nearest-neighbor search, compressed sensing and linear algebra in the streaming model. In this work we obtain a {\em sparse} version of the fundamental tool in dimension reduction --- the Johnson--Lindenstrauss transform. Using hashing and local densification, we construct a sparse projection matrix with just \\(\tilde&#123;O&#125;(\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;\epsilon&#125;)\\) non-zero entries per column. We also show a matching lower bound on the sparsity for a large class of projection matrices. Our bounds are somewhat surprising, given the known lower bounds of \\(\Omega(\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;\epsilon^2&#125;)\\) both on the number of rows of any projection matrix and on the sparsity of projection matrices generated by natural constructions. Using this, we achieve an \\(\tilde&#123;O&#125;(\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;\epsilon&#125;)\\) update time per non-zero element for a \\((1\pm\epsilon)\\)-approximate projection, thereby substantially outperforming the \\(\tilde&#123;O&#125;(\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;\epsilon^2&#125;)\\) update time required by prior approaches. A variant of our method offers the same guarantees for sparse vectors, yet its \\(\tilde&#123;O&#125;(d)\\) worst case running time matches the best approach of Ailon and Liberty.
