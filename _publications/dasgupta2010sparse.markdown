Dimension reduction is a key algorithmic tool with many applications including nearest-neighbor search, compressed sensing and linear algebra in the streaming model. In this work we obtain a \{\em sparse\} version of the fundamental tool in dimension reduction --- the Johnson--Lindenstrauss transform. Using hashing and local densification, we construct a sparse projection matrix with just \(\tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash\frac\{1\}\{\epsilon\})\) non-zero entries per column. We also show a matching lower bound on the sparsity for a large class of projection matrices. Our bounds are somewhat surprising, given the known lower bounds of \(\Omega(\textbackslash\frac\{1\}\{\epsilon^2\})\) both on the number of rows of any projection matrix and on the sparsity of projection matrices generated by natural constructions. Using this, we achieve an \(\tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash\frac\{1\}\{\epsilon\})\) update time per non-zero element for a \((1\pm\epsilon)\)-approximate projection, thereby substantially outperforming the \(\tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash\frac\{1\}\{\epsilon^2\})\) update time required by prior approaches. A variant of our method offers the same guarantees for sparse vectors, yet its \(\tilde\{O\}(d)\) worst case running time matches the best approach of Ailon and Liberty.
