A gray-level image texture descriptors based on fractal dimension estimation
is proposed in this work. The proposed method estimates the fractal dimension
using probability (Voss) method. The descriptors are computed applying a
multiscale transform to the fractal dimension curves of the texture image. The
proposed texture descriptor method is evaluated in a classification task of
well known benchmark texture datasets. The results show the great performance
of the proposed method as a tool for texture images analysis and
characterization.
