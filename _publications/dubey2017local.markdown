Face recognition is still a very demanding area of research. This problem
becomes more challenging in unconstrained environment and in the presence of
several variations like pose, illumination, expression, etc. Local descriptors
are widely used for this task. The most of the existing local descriptors
consider only few immediate local neighbors and not able to utilize the wider
local information to make the descriptor more discriminative. The wider local
information based descriptors mainly suffer due to the increased
dimensionality. In this paper, this problem is solved by encoding the
relationship among directional neighbors in an efficient manner. The
relationship between the center pixel and the encoded directional neighbors is
utilized further to form the proposed local directional relation pattern
(LDRP). The descriptor is inherently uniform illumination invariant. The
multi-scale mechanism is also adapted to further boost the discriminative
ability of the descriptor. The proposed descriptor is evaluated under the image
retrieval framework over face databases. Very challenging databases like PaSC,
LFW, PubFig, ESSEX, FERET, AT&T, and FaceScrub are used to test the
discriminative ability and robustness of LDRP descriptor. Results are also
compared with the recent state-of-the-art face descriptors such as LBP, LTP,
LDP, LDN, LVP, DCP, LDGP and LGHP. Very promising performance is observed using
the proposed descriptor over very appealing face databases as compared to the
existing face descriptors. The proposed LDRP descriptor also outperforms the
pre-trained ImageNet CNN models over large-scale FaceScrub face dataset.
Moreover, it also outperforms the deep learning based DLib face descriptor in
many scenarios.
