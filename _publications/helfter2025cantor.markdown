For every couple of Hausdorff functions \(\psi, \varphi\) verifying some mild
assumptions, we construct a compact subset \( K \) of the Baire space such that
the \(\varphi\)-Hausdorff measure and the \(\psi\)-packing measure on \( K \) are
both finite and positive. We then embed such examples in any
infinite-dimensional Banach space to answer positively to a question of Fan on
the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.
