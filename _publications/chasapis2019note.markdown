Our starting point is an improved version of a result of D. Hajela related to
a question of Koml\'\{o\}s: we show that if \\(f(n)\\) is a function such that
\\(\lim\limits_\{n\to\infty \}f(n)=\infty \\) and \\(f(n)=o(n)\\), there exists
\\(n_0=n_0(f)\\) such that for every \\(n\geqslant n_0\\) and any \\(S\subseteq
\\{-1,1\\}^n\\) with cardinality \\(|S|\leqslant 2^\{n/f(n)\}\\) one can find orthonormal
vectors \\(x_1,\ldots ,x_n\in \{\mathbb R\}^n\\) that satisfy
$\\(\|\epsilon_1x_1+\cdots +\epsilon_nx_n\|_\{\infty \}\geqslant c\sqrt\{log
f(n)\}\\)\\( for all \\)(\epsilon_1,\ldots ,\epsilon_n)\in S\\(. We obtain analogous
results in the case where \\)x_1,\ldots ,x_n\\( are independent random points
uniformly distributed in the Euclidean unit ball \\)B_2^n\\( or any symmetric
convex body, and the \\)\ell_\{\infty \}^n\\(-norm is replaced by an arbitrary norm
on \\)\{\mathbb R\}^n$.
