This paper presents TrashCan, a large dataset comprised of images of
underwater trash collected from a variety of sources, annotated both using
bounding boxes and segmentation labels, for development of robust detectors of
marine debris. The dataset has two versions, TrashCan-Material and
TrashCan-Instance, corresponding to different object class configurations. The
eventual goal is to develop efficient and accurate trash detection methods
suitable for onboard robot deployment. Along with information about the
construction and sourcing of the TrashCan dataset, we present initial results
of instance segmentation from Mask R-CNN and object detection from Faster
R-CNN. These do not represent the best possible detection results but provides
an initial baseline for future work in instance segmentation and object
detection on the TrashCan dataset.
