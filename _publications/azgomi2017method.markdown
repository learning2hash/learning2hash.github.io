A basic topic in mining of massive dataset is finding similar items. As an
example, finding similar documents can be recommended. In this case many
methods are existed. For example, Shingling method and length based filtering
are one of them. In Shingling method, from each document, substrings have been
selected with symbol name and, they are placed on one set. For finding similar
documents, the similarities of sets that related with them have been
calculated. In Length based filtering just documents which close these lengths
have been compared. These methods don't consider repetition of symbols. With
considering the repetition can calculate length of documents with more
accurately. In this paper we suggested a method for finding similar documents
with considering the repetition of symbols. This method separated documents to
better form. The main goal of this paper is presentation a method for finding
similar documents with take fewer comparisons and time indeed.
