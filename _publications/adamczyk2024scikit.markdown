In this work, we present scikit-fingerprints, a Python package for
computation of molecular fingerprints for applications in chemoinformatics. Our
library offers an industry-standard scikit-learn interface, allowing intuitive
usage and easy integration with machine learning pipelines. It is also highly
optimized, featuring parallel computation that enables efficient processing of
large molecular datasets. Currently, scikit-fingerprints stands as the most
feature-rich library in the open source Python ecosystem, offering over 30
molecular fingerprints. Our library simplifies chemoinformatics tasks based on
molecular fingerprints, including molecular property prediction and virtual
screening. It is also flexible, highly efficient, and fully open source.
