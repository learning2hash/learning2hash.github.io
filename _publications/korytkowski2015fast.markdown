This paper presents a novel approach to visual objects classification based
on generating simple fuzzy classifiers using local image features to
distinguish between one known class and other classes. Boosting meta learning
is used to find the most representative local features. The proposed approach
is tested on a state-of-the-art image dataset and compared with the
bag-of-features image representation model combined with the Support Vector
Machine classification. The novel method gives better classification accuracy
and the time of learning and testing process is more than 30% shorter.
