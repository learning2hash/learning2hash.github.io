Malware lineage studies the evolutionary relationships among malware and has
important applications for malware analysis. A persistent limitation of prior
malware lineage approaches is to consider every input sample a separate malware
version. This is problematic since a majority of malware are packed and the
packing process produces many polymorphic variants (i.e., executables with
different file hash) of the same malware version. Thus, many samples correspond
to the same malware version and it is challenging to identify distinct malware
versions from polymorphic variants. This problem does not manifest in prior
malware lineage approaches because they work on synthetic malware, malware that
are not packed, or packed malware for which unpackers are available. In this
work, we propose a novel malware lineage approach that works on malware samples
collected in the wild. Given a set of malware executables from the same family,
for which no source code is available and which may be packed, our approach
produces a lineage graph where nodes are versions of the family and edges
describe the relationships between versions. To enable our malware lineage
approach, we propose the first technique to identify the versions of a malware
family and a scalable code indexing technique for determining shared functions
between any pair of input samples. We have evaluated the accuracy of our
approach on 13 open-source programs and have applied it to produce lineage
graphs for 10 popular malware families. Our malware lineage graphs achieve on
average a 26 times reduction from number of input samples to number of
versions.
