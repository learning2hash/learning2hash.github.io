We show exact dimensionality of harmonic measures associated with random
walks on groups acting on a hyperbolic space under finite first moment
condition, and establish the dimension formula by the entropy over the drift.
We also treat the case when a group acts on a non-proper hyperbolic space
acylindrically. Applications of this formula include continuity of the
Hausdorff dimension with respect to driving measures and Brownian motions on
regular coverings of a finite volume Riemannian manifold.
