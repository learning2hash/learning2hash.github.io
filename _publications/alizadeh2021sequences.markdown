For a linear code \\(C\\) of length \\(n\\) with dimension \\(k\\) and minimum distance
\\(d\\), it is desirable that the quantity \\(kd/n\\) is large. Given an arbitrary
field \\(\mathbb\{F\}\\), we introduce a novel, but elementary, construction that
produces a recursively defined sequence of \\(\mathbb\{F\}\\)-linear codes \\(C_1,C_2,
C_3, \dots\\) with parameters \\([n_i, k_i, d_i]\\) such that \\(k_id_i/n_i\\) grows
quickly in the sense that \\(k_id_i/n_i>\sqrt\{k_i\}-1>2i-1\\). Another example of
quick growth comes from a certain subsequence of Reed-Muller codes. Here the
field is \\(\mathbb\{F\}=\mathbb\{F\}_2\\) and \\(k_i d_i/n_i\\) is asymptotic to
\\(3n_i^\{c\}/\sqrt\{\pilog_2(n_i)\}\\) where \\(c=log_2(3/2)\approx 0.585\\).
