In this paper we describe a variation of the classical permutation decoding
algorithm that can be applied to any affine-invariant code with respect to
certain type of information sets. In particular, we can apply it to the family
of first-order Reed-Muller codes with respect to the information sets
introduced in [2]. Using this algortihm we improve considerably the number of
errors we can correct in comparison with the known results in this topic.
