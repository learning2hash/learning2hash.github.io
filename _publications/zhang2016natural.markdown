Natural scene character recognition is challenging due to the cluttered
background, which is hard to separate from text. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for robust scene character recognition. Specifically, we first use
robust principal component analysis (PCA) to denoise character image by
recovering the missing low-rank component and filtering out the sparse noise
term, and then use a simple Histogram of oriented Gradient (HOG) to perform
image feature extraction, and finally, use a sparse representation based
classifier for recognition. In experiments on four public datasets, namely the
Char74K dataset, ICADAR 2003 robust reading dataset, Street View Text (SVT)
dataset and IIIT5K-word dataset, our method was demonstrated to be competitive
with the state-of-the-art methods.
