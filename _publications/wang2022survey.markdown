Shannon separation theorem lays the foundation for traditional image
compression and transmission schemes, which consist of JPEG type image
compression methods and the usual channel coding schemes such as Turbo and LDPC
codes. One of the advantages of the separate design is that each of the two
components, channel coding and source coding can be handled independently
without considering the other, which is the base of decades-long technologies.
