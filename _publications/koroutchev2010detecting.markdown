The purpose of this paper is to introduce an algorithm that can detect the
most unusual part of a digital image in probabilistic setting. The most unusual
part of a given shape is defined as a part of the image that has the maximal
distance to all non intersecting shapes with the same form. The method is
tested on two and three-dimensional images and has shown very good results
without any predefined model. A version of the method independent of the
contrast of the image is considered and is found to be useful for finding the
most unusual part (and the most similar part) of the image conditioned on given
image. The results can be used to scan large image databases, as for example
medical databases.
