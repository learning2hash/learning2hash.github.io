The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted the attention of the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study we aim to conduct an empirical analysis of ChatGPTs recommendation ability from an Information Retrieval (IR) perspective including point-wise pair-wise and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal we re-formulate the above three recommendation policies into a domain-specific prompt format. Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms other large language models across all three ranking policies. Based on the analysis of unit cost improvements we identify that ChatGPT with list-wise ranking achieves the best trade-off between cost and performance compared to point-wise and pair-wise ranking. Moreover ChatGPT shows the potential for mitigating the cold start problem and explainable recommendation. To facilitate further explorations in this area the full code and detailed original results are open-sourced at https://github.com/rainym00d/LLM4RS.
