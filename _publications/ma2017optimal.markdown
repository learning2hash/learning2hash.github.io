In recent years, several classes of codes are introduced to provide some
fault-tolerance and guarantee system reliability in distributed storage
systems, among which locally repairable codes (LRCs for short) play an
important role. However, most known constructions are over large fields with
sizes close to the code length, which lead to the systems computationally
expensive. Due to this, binary LRCs are of interest in practice. In this paper,
we focus on binary linear LRCs with disjoint repair groups. We first derive an
explicit bound for the dimension k of such codes, which can be served as a
generalization of the bounds given in [11, 36, 37]. We also give several new
constructions of binary LRCs with minimum distance \\(d = 6\\) based on weakly
independent sets and partial spreads, which are optimal with respect to our
newly obtained bound. In particular, for locality \\(r\in \\{2,3\\}\\) and minimum
distance \\(d = 6\\), we obtain the desired optimal binary linear LRCs with
disjoint repair groups for almost all parameters.
