We present the first \(\mathrm\{o\}(n)\)-space polynomial-time algorithm for
computing the length of a longest common subsequence. Given two strings of
length \(n\), the algorithm runs in \(\mathrm\{O\}(n^\{3\})\) time with
\(\mathrm\{O\}\left(\frac\{n log^\{1.5\} n\}\{2^\{\sqrt\{log n\}\}\}\right)\) bits of
space.
