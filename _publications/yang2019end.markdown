We demonstrate an end-to-end question answering system that integrates BERT
with the open-source Anserini information retrieval toolkit. In contrast to
most question answering and reading comprehension models today, which operate
over small amounts of input text, our system integrates best practices from IR
with a BERT-based reader to identify answers from a large corpus of Wikipedia
articles in an end-to-end fashion. We report large improvements over previous
results on a standard benchmark test collection, showing that fine-tuning
pretrained BERT with SQuAD is sufficient to achieve high accuracy in
identifying answer spans.
