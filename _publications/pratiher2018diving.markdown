Histopathological images (HI) encrypt resolution dependent heterogeneous textures &amp; diverse color distribution variability, manifesting in micro-structural surface tissue convolutions. Also, inherently high coherency of cancerous cells poses significant challenges to breast cancer (BC) multi-classification. As such, multi-class stratification is sparsely explored &amp; prior work mainly focus on benign &amp; malignant tissue characterization only, which forestalls further quantitative analysis of subordinate classes like adenosis, mucinous carcinoma &amp; fibroadenoma etc, for diagnostic competence. In this work, a fully-automated, near-real-time &amp; computationally inexpensive robust multi-classification deep framework from HI is presented. The proposed scheme employs deep neural network (DNN) aided discriminative ensemble of holistic class-specific manifold learning (CSML) for underlying HI sub-space embedding &amp; HI hashing based local shallow signatures. The model achieves 95.8&#37; accuracy pertinent to multi-classification &amp; 2.8&#37; overall performance improvement &amp; 38.2&#37; enhancement for Lobular carcinoma (LC) sub-class recognition rate as compared to the existing state-of-the-art on well known BreakHis dataset is achieved. Also, 99.3&#37; recognition rate at 200X &amp; a sensitivity of 100&#37; for binary grading at all magnification validates its suitability for clinical deployment in hand-held smart devices.
