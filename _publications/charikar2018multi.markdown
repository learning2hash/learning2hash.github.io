A basic computational primitive in the analysis of massive datasets is summing simple functions over a large number of objects. Modern applications pose an additional challenge in that such functions often depend on a parameter vector \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(y\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} (query) that is unknown a priori. Given a set of points $X\subset \mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( and a pairwise function \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}w:\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\times \mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\to [0,1]$, we study the problem of designing a data-structure that enables sublinear-time approximation of the summation \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(Z\_\{w\}(y)=\frac\{1\}\{|X|\}\sum\_\{x\in X\}w(x,y)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} for any query $y\in \mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}$. By combining ideas from Harmonic Analysis (partitions of unity and approximation theory) with Hashing-Based-Estimators [Charikar, Siminelakis FOCS'17], we provide a general framework for designing such data structures through hashing that reaches far beyond what previous techniques allowed. A key design principle is a collection of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(T\geq 1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} hashing schemes with collision probabilities \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(p\_\{1\},\ldots, p\_\{T\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} such that $\sup\_\{t\in [T]\}\\{p\_\{t\}(x,y)\\} = \Theta(\sqrt\{w(x,y)\})$. This leads to a data-structure that approximates \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(Z\_\{w\}(y)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} using a sub-linear number of samples from each hash family. Using this new framework along with Distance Sensitive Hashing [Aumuller, Christiani, Pagh, Silvestri PODS'18], we show that such a collection can be constructed and evaluated efficiently for any log-convex function \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w(x,y)=e^\{\phi(\langle x,y\rangle)\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of the inner product on the unit sphere \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(x,y\in \mathcal\{S\}^\{d-1\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Our method leads to data structures with sub-linear query time that significantly improve upon random sampling and can be used for Kernel Density or Partition Function Estimation. We provide extensions of our result from the sphere to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{d\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and from scalar functions to vector functions.
