<p>The method of random projection has been a popular tool for data
compression, similarity search, and machine learning. In many practical
scenarios, applying quantization on randomly projected data could be
very helpful to further reduce storage cost and facilitate more
efficient retrievals, while only suffering from little loss in accuracy.
In real-world applications, however, data collected from different
sources may be quantized under different schemes, which calls for a need
to study the asymmetric quantization problem. In this paper, we
investigate the cosine similarity estimators derived in such setting
under the Lloyd-Max (LM) quantization scheme. We thoroughly analyze the
biases and variances of a series of estimators including the basic
simple estimators, their normalized versions, and their debiased
versions. Furthermore, by studying the monotonicity, we show that the
expectation of proposed estimators increases with the true cosine
similarity, on a broader family of stair-shaped quantizers. Experiments
on nearest neighbor search justify the theory and illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed estimators.</p>
