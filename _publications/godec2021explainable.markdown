Two-dimensional data maps can visually reveal information about the relations
between data instances. Popular techniques to construct data maps are t-SNE and
UMAP. The resulting point-based visualizations, though, provide information
only through their interpretation. We here consider a set of abstracts from the
articles on longevity to argue for using keyword extraction methods to label
clusters of documents in the map. Among the considered approaches, the best
results were obtained by recently proposed YAKE!. Surprisingly, a classical
TF-IDF term ranking outperformed graph and embedding-based techniques.
