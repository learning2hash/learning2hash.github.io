Hierarchical semantic structures naturally existing in real45;world datasets can assist in capturing the latent distribution of data to learn robust hash codes for retrieval systems. Although hierarchical semantic structures can be simply expressed by integrating semantically relevant data into a high45;level taxon with coarser45;grained semantics the construction embedding and exploitation of the structures remain tricky for unsupervised hash learning. To tackle these problems we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper45;sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition we extend the K45;Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K45;Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm including hierarchical instance45;wise and hierarchical prototype45;wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art unsupervised hashing methods. Codes will be released.
