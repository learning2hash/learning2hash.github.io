This paper explores novel approaches for improving the spatial codification
for the pooling of local descriptors to solve the semantic segmentation
problem. We propose to partition the image into three regions for each object
to be described: Figure, Border and Ground. This partition aims at minimizing
the influence of the image context on the object description and vice versa by
introducing an intermediate zone around the object contour. Furthermore, we
also propose a richer visual descriptor of the object by applying a Spatial
Pyramid over the Figure region. Two novel Spatial Pyramid configurations are
explored: Cartesian-based and crown-based Spatial Pyramids. We test these
approaches with state-of-the-art techniques and show that they improve the
Figure-Ground based pooling in the Pascal VOC 2011 and 2012 semantic
segmentation challenges.
