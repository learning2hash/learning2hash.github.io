Let \\(G\\) be a connected graph and let \\(\mathbb\{X\}\\) be the set of projective
points defined by the column vectors of the incidence matrix of \\(G\\) over a
field \\(K\\) of any characteristic. We determine the generalized Hamming weights
of the Reed--Muller-type code over the set \\(\mathbb\{X\}\\) in terms of graph
theoretic invariants. As an application to coding theory we show that if \\(G\\) is
non-bipartite and \\(K\\) is a finite field of \\(\{\rm char\}(K)\neq 2\\), then the
\\(r\\)-th generalized Hamming weight of the linear code generated by the rows of
the incidence matrix of \\(G\\) is the \\(r\\)-th weak edge biparticity of \\(G\\). If
\\(\{\rm char\}(K)=2\\) or \\(G\\) is bipartite, we prove that the \\(r\\)-th generalized
Hamming weight of that code is the \\(r\\)-th edge connectivity of \\(G\\).
