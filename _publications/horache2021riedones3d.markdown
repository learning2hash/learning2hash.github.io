Clustering coins with respect to their die is an important component of
numismatic research and crucial for understanding the economic history of
tribes (especially when literary production does not exist, in celtic culture).
It is a very hard task that requires a lot of times and expertise. To cluster
thousands of coins, automatic methods are becoming necessary. Nevertheless,
public datasets for coin die clustering evaluation are too rare, though they
are very important for the development of new methods. Therefore, we propose a
new 3D dataset of 2 070 scans of coins. With this dataset, we propose two
benchmarks, one for point cloud registration, essential for coin die
recognition, and a benchmark of coin die clustering. We show how we
automatically cluster coins to help experts, and perform a preliminary
evaluation for these two tasks. The code of the baseline and the dataset will
be publicly available at https://www.npm3d.fr/coins-riedones3d and
