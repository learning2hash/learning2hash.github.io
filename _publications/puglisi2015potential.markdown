Proximity-based social applications let users interact with people that are
currently close to them, by revealing some information about their preferences
and whereabouts. This information is acquired through passive geo-localisation
and used to build a sense of serendipitous discovery of people, places and
interests. Unfortunately, while this class of applications opens different
interactions possibilities for people in urban settings, obtaining access to
certain identity information could lead a possible privacy attacker to identify
and follow a user in their movements in a specific period of time. The same
information shared through the platform could also help an attacker to link the
victim's online profiles to physical identities. We analyse a set of popular
dating application that shares users relative distances within a certain radius
and show how, by using the information shared on these platforms, it is
possible to formalise a multilateration attack, able to identify the user
actual position. The same attack can also be used to follow a user in all their
movements within a certain period of time, therefore identifying their habits
and Points of Interest across the city. Furthermore we introduce a social
attack which uses common Facebook likes to profile a person and finally
identify their real identity.
