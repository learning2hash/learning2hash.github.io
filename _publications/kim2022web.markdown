In recent years, research on visual document understanding (VDU) has grown
significantly, with a particular emphasis on the development of self-supervised
learning methods. However, one of the significant challenges faced in this
field is the limited availability of publicly accessible visual corpora or
extensive collections of images with detailed text annotations, particularly
for non-Latin or resource-scarce languages. To address this challenge, we
propose Web-based Visual Corpus Builder (Webvicob), a dataset generator engine
capable of constructing large-scale, multilingual visual corpora from raw
Wikipedia HTML dumps. Our experiments demonstrate that the data generated by
Webvicob can be used to train robust VDU models that perform well on various
downstream tasks, such as DocVQA and post-OCR parsing. Furthermore, when using
a dataset of 1 million images generated by Webvicob, we observed an improvement
of over 13% on the DocVQA Task 3 compared to a dataset of 11 million images
from the IIT-CDIP. The implementation of our engine is publicly available on
