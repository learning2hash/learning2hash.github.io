In this work, we propose a method for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction
of wide crime scene, based on a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approach. We used a Kinect V2 Time-of-Flight (TOF) RGB-D camera to provide
colored dense point clouds at a 30 Hz frequency. This device is moved freely (6
degrees of freedom) during the scene exploration. The implemented SLAM solution
aligns successive point clouds using an 3D keypoints description and matching
approach. This type of approach exploits both colorimetric and geometrical
information, and permits reconstruction under poor illumination conditions. Our
solution has been tested for indoor crime scene and outdoor archaeological site
reconstruction, returning a mean error around one centimeter. It is less
precise than environmental laser scanner solution, but more practical and
portable as well as less cumbersome. Also, the hardware is definitively
cheaper.
