In this paper, a copy-move forgery detection method based on Convolutional
Kernel Network is proposed. Different from methods based on conventional
hand-crafted features, Convolutional Kernel Network is a kind of data-driven
local descriptor with the deep convolutional structure. Thanks to the
development of deep learning theories and widely available datasets, the
data-driven methods can achieve competitive performance on different conditions
for its excellent discriminative capability. Besides, our Convolutional Kernel
Network is reformulated as a series of matrix computations and convolutional
operations which are easy to parallelize and accelerate by GPU, leading to high
efficiency. Then, appropriate preprocessing and postprocessing for
Convolutional Kernel Network are adopted to achieve copy-move forgery
detection. Particularly, a segmentation-based keypoints distribution strategy
is proposed and a GPU-based adaptive oversegmentation method is adopted.
Numerous experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the GPU version of Convolutional Kernel Network, and the
state-of-the-art performance of the proposed copy-move forgery detection method
based on Convolutional Kernel Network.
