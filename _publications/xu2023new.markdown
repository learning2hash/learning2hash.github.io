Matrix product codes are generalizations of some well-known constructions of
codes, such as Reed-Muller codes, \([u+v,u-v]\)-construction, etc. Recently, a
bound for the symbol-pair distance of a matrix product code was given in
\cite\{LEL\}, and new families of MDS symbol-pair codes were constructed by using
this bound. In this paper, we generalize this bound to the \(b\)-symbol distance
of a matrix product code and determine all minimum \(b\)-symbol distances of
Reed-Muller codes. We also give a bound for the minimum \(b\)-symbol distance of
codes obtained from the \([u+v,u-v]\)-construction, and use this bound to
construct some \([2n,2n-2]_q\)-linear \(b\)-symbol almost MDS codes with arbitrary
length. All the minimum \(b\)-symbol distances of \([n,n-1]_q\)-linear codes and
\([n,n-2]_q\)-linear codes for \(1\leq b\leq n\) are determined. Some examples are
presented to illustrate these results.
