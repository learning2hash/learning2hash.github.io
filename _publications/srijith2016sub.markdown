Social media has now become the de facto information source on real world
events. The challenge, however, due to the high volume and velocity nature of
social media streams, is in how to follow all posts pertaining to a given event
over time, a task referred to as story detection. Moreover, there are often
several different stories pertaining to a given event, which we refer to as
sub-stories and the corresponding task of their automatic detection as
sub-story detection. This paper proposes hierarchical Dirichlet processes
(HDP), a probabilistic topic model, as an effective method for automatic
sub-story detection. HDP can learn sub-topics associated with sub-stories which
enables it to handle subtle variations in sub-stories. It is compared with
state- of-the-art story detection approaches based on locality sensitive
hashing and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the superior performance of HDP
for sub-story detection on real world Twitter data sets using various
evaluation measures. The ability of HDP to learn sub-topics helps it to recall
the sub- stories with high precision. Another contribution of this paper is in
demonstrating that the conversational structures within the Twitter stream can
be used to improve sub-story detection performance significantly.
