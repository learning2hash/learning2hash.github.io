We introduce the \textit\{multi-view pattern matching\} problem, where a text
can have multiple views. Each view is a string of the same size and drawn from
disjoint alphabets. The pattern is drawn from the union of all alphabets.
  The algorithm we present is an extension of the Horspool algorithm, and in
our experiments on synthetic data it shows an \(3 \times\) improvement over the
naive baseline.
