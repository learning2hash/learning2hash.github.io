A recent "third wave" of Neural Network (NN) approaches now delivers
state-of-the-art performance in many machine learning tasks, spanning speech
recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. Because these
modern NNs often comprise multiple interconnected layers, this new NN research
is often referred to as deep learning. Stemming from this tide of NN work, a
number of researchers have recently begun to investigate NN approaches to
Information Retrieval (IR). While deep NNs have yet to achieve the same level
of success in IR as seen in other areas, the recent surge of interest and work
in NNs for IR suggest that this state of affairs may be quickly changing. In
this work, we survey the current landscape of Neural IR research, paying
special attention to the use of learned representations of queries and
documents (i.e., neural embeddings). We highlight the successes of neural IR
thus far, catalog obstacles to its wider adoption, and suggest potentially
promising directions for future research.
