Gleason's 1970 theorem on weight enumerators of self-dual codes has played a
crucial role for research in coding theory during the last four decades. Plenty
of generalizations have been proved but, to our knowledge, they are all based
on the symmetries given by MacWilliams' identities. This paper is intended to
be a first step towards a more general investigation of symmetries of weight
enumerators. We list the possible groups of symmetries, dealing both with the
finite and infinite case, we develop a new algorithm to compute the group of
symmetries of a given weight enumerator and apply these methods to the family
of Reed-Muller codes, giving, in the binary case, an analogue of Gleason's
theorem for all parameters.
