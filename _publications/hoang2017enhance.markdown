We introduce a novel approach to improve unsupervised hashing. Specifically we propose a very efficient embedding method Gaussian Mixture Model embedding (Gemb). The proposed method using Gaussian Mixture Model embeds feature vector into a low-dimensional vector and simultaneously enhances the discriminative property of features before passing them into hashing. Our experiment shows that the proposed method boosts the hashing performance of many state-of-the-art e.g. Binary Autoencoder (BA) 1 Iterative Quantization (ITQ) 2 in standard evaluation metrics for the three main benchmark datasets.
