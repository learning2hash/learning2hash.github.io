In this paper, we design a benchmark task and provide the associated datasets
for recognizing face images and link them to corresponding entity keys in a
knowledge base. More specifically, we propose a benchmark task to recognize one
million celebrities from their face images, by using all the possibly collected
face images of this individual on the web as training data. The rich
information provided by the knowledge base helps to conduct disambiguation and
improve the recognition accuracy, and contributes to various real-world
applications, such as image captioning and news video analysis. Associated with
this task, we design and provide concrete measurement set, evaluation protocol,
as well as training data. We also present in details our experiment setup and
report promising baseline results. Our benchmark task could lead to one of the
largest classification problems in computer vision. To the best of our
knowledge, our training dataset, which contains 10M images in version 1, is the
largest publicly available one in the world.
