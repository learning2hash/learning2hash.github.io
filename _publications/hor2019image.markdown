With the development of Information technology and communication, a large part
of the databases is dedicated to images and videos. Thus retrieving images
related to a query image from a large database has become an important area of
research in computer vision. Until now, there are various methods of image
retrieval that try to define image contents by texture, color or shape
properties. In this paper, a method is presented for image retrieval based on a
combination of local texture information derived from two different texture
descriptors. First, the color channels of the input image are separated. The
texture information is extracted using two descriptors such as evaluated local
binary patterns and predefined pattern units. After extracting the features, the
similarity matching is done based on distance criteria. The performance of the
proposed method is evaluated in terms of precision and recall on the Simplicity
database. The comparative results showed that the proposed approach offers
higher precision rate than many known methods.
