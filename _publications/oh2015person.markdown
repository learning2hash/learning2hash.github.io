Recognising persons in everyday photos presents major challenges (occluded
faces, different clothing, locations, etc.) for machine vision. We propose a
convnet based person recognition system on which we provide an in-depth
analysis of informativeness of different body cues, impact of training data,
and the common failure modes of the system. In addition, we discuss the
limitations of existing benchmarks and propose more challenging ones. Our
method is simple and is built on open source and open data, yet it improves the
state of the art results on a large dataset of social media photos (PIPA).
