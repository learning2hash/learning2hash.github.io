Abelian string matching problems are becoming an object of considerable
interest in last years. Very recently, Alatabbi et al. \cite\{AILR2015\}
presented the first solution for the longest common Abelian factor problem for
a pair of strings, reaching \(O(\sigma n^2)\) time with \(O(\sigma n log n)\) bits
of space, where \(n\) is the length of the strings and \(\sigma\) is the alphabet
size. In this note we show how the time complexity can be preserved while the
space is reduced by a factor of \(\sigma\), and then how the time complexity can
be improved, if the alphabet is not too small, when superlinear space is
allowed.
