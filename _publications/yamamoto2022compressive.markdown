The use of relative attribute (e.g., beautiful, safe, convenient) -based
image embeddings in visual place recognition, as a domain-adaptive compact
image descriptor that is orthogonal to the typical approach of absolute
attribute (e.g., color, shape, texture) -based image embeddings, is explored in
this paper.
