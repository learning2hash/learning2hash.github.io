    The use of relative attribute (e.g., beautiful, safe, convenient) -based image embeddings in visual place recognition, as a domain-adaptive compact image descriptor that is orthogonal to the typical approach of absolute attribute (e.g., color, shape, texture) -based image embeddings, is explored in this paper.
