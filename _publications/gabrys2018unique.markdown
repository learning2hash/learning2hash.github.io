The problem of reconstructing strings from their substring spectra has a long
history and in its most simple incarnation asks for determining under which
conditions the spectrum uniquely determines the string. We study the problem of
coded string reconstruction from multiset substring spectra, where the strings
are restricted to lie in some codebook. In particular, we consider binary
codebooks that allow for unique string reconstruction and propose a new method,
termed repeat replacement, to create the codebook. Our contributions include
algorithmic solutions for repeat replacement and constructive redundancy bounds
for the underlying coding schemes. We also consider extensions of the problem
to noisy settings in which substrings are compromised by burst and random
errors. The study is motivated by applications in DNA-based data storage
systems that use high throughput readout sequencers.
