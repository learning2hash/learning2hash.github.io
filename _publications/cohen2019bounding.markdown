Consider the empirical measure, \(\hat\{\mathbb\{P\}\}_N\), associated to \(N\)
i.i.d. samples of a given probability distribution \(\mathbb\{P\}\) on the unit
interval. For fixed \(\mathbb\{P\}\) the Wasserstein distance between
\(\hat\{\mathbb\{P\}\}_N\) and \(\mathbb\{P\}\) is a random variable on the sample space
\([0,1]^N\). Our main result is that its normalised quantiles are asymptotically
maximised when \(\mathbb\{P\}\) is a convex combination between the uniform
distribution supported on the two points \(\\{0,1\\}\) and the uniform distribution
on the unit interval \([0,1]\). This allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic
confidence regions for the underlying measure \(\mathbb\{P\}\).
  We also suggest extensions to higher dimensions with numerical evidence.
