With the rise of Social Media, people obtain and share information almost
instantly on a 24/7 basis. Many research areas have tried to gain valuable
insights from these large volumes of freely available user generated content.
  With the goal of extracting knowledge from social media streams that might be
useful in the context of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities,
we designed and developed a framework that provides functionalities for
parallel collection of geo-located tweets from multiple pre-defined bounding
boxes (cities or regions), including filtering of non-complying tweets, text
pre-processing for Portuguese and English language, topic modeling, and
transportation-specific text classifiers, as well as, aggregation and data
visualization.
  We performed an exploratory data analysis of geo-located tweets in 5
different cities: Rio de Janeiro, S\~ao Paulo, New York City, London and
Melbourne, comprising a total of more than 43 million tweets in a period of 3
months. Furthermore, we performed a large scale topic modelling comparison
between Rio de Janeiro and S\~ao Paulo. Interestingly, most of the topics are
shared between both cities which despite being in the same country are
considered very different regarding population, economy and lifestyle.
  We take advantage of recent developments in word embeddings and train such
representations from the collections of geo-located tweets. We then use a
combination of bag-of-embeddings and traditional bag-of-words to train
travel-related classifiers in both Portuguese and English to filter
travel-related content from non-related. We created specific gold-standard data
to perform empirical evaluation of the resulting classifiers. Results are in
line with research work in other application areas by showing the robustness of
using word embeddings to learn word similarities that bag-of-words is not able
to capture.
