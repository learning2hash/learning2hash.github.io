Puzzle solving is a combinatorial challenge due to the difficulty of matching
adjacent pieces. Instead, we infer a mental image from all pieces, which a
given piece can then be matched against avoiding the combinatorial explosion.
Exploiting advancements in Generative Adversarial methods, we learn how to
reconstruct the image given a set of unordered pieces, allowing the model to
learn a joint embedding space to match an encoding of each piece to the cropped
layer of the generator. Therefore we frame the problem as a R@1 retrieval task,
and then solve the linear assignment using differentiable Hungarian attention,
making the process end-to-end. In doing so our model is puzzle size agnostic,
in contrast to prior deep learning methods which are single size. We evaluate
on two new large-scale datasets, where our model is on par with deep learning
methods, while generalizing to multiple puzzle sizes.
