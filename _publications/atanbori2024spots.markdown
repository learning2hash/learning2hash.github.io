Recognising animals based on distinctive body patterns, such as stripes,
spots, or other markings, in night images is a complex task in computer vision.
Existing methods for detecting animals in images often rely on colour
information, which is not always available in night images, posing a challenge
for pattern recognition in such conditions. Nevertheless, recognition at
night-time is essential for most wildlife, biodiversity, and conservation
applications. The SPOTS-10 dataset was created to address this challenge and to
provide a resource for evaluating machine learning algorithms in situ. This
dataset is an extensive collection of grayscale images showcasing diverse
patterns found in ten animal species. Specifically, SPOTS-10 contains 50,000 32
x 32 grayscale images, divided into ten categories, with 5,000 images per
category. The training set comprises 40,000 images, while the test set contains
10,000 images. The SPOTS-10 dataset is freely available on the project GitHub
page: https://github.com/Amotica/SPOTS-10.git by cloning the repository.
