In recent years, deep dictionary learning (DDL)has attracted a great amount
of attention due to its effectiveness for representation learning and visual
recognition.~However, most existing methods focus on unsupervised deep
dictionary learning, failing to further explore the category information.~To
make full use of the category information of different samples, we propose a
novel deep dictionary learning model with an intra-class constraint (DDLIC) for
visual classification. Specifically, we design the intra-class compactness
constraint on the intermediate representation at different levels to encourage
the intra-class representations to be closer to each other, and eventually the
learned representation becomes more discriminative.~Unlike the traditional DDL
methods, during the classification stage, our DDLIC performs a layer-wise
greedy optimization in a similar way to the training stage. Experimental
results on four image datasets show that our method is superior to the
state-of-the-art methods.
