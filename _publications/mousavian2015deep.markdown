Several recent approaches showed how the representations learned by
Convolutional Neural Networks can be repurposed for novel tasks. Most commonly
it has been shown that the activation features of the last fully connected
layers (fc7 or fc6) of the network, followed by a linear classifier outperform
the state-of-the-art on several recognition challenge datasets. Instead of
recognition, this paper focuses on the image retrieval problem and proposes a
examines alternative pooling strategies derived for CNN features. The presented
scheme uses the features maps from an earlier layer 5 of the CNN architecture,
which has been shown to preserve coarse spatial information and is semantically
meaningful. We examine several pooling strategies and demonstrate superior
performance on the image retrieval task (INRIA Holidays) at the fraction of the
computational cost, while using a relatively small memory requirements. In
addition to retrieval, we see similar efficiency gains on the SUN397 scene
categorization dataset, demonstrating wide applicability of this simple
strategy. We also introduce and evaluate a novel GeoPlaces5K dataset from
different geographical locations in the world for image retrieval that stresses
more dramatic changes in appearance and viewpoint.
