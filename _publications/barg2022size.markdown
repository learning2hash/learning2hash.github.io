We address the maximum size of binary codes and binary constant weight codes
with few distances. Previous works established a number of bounds for these
quantities as well as the exact values for a range of small code lengths. As
our main results, we determine the exact size of maximal binary codes with two
distances for all lengths \\(n\ge 6\\) as well as the exact size of maximal binary
constant weight codes with 2,3, and 4 distances for several values of the
weight and for all but small lengths.
