We develop a new class of distances for objects including lines, hyperplanes,
and trajectories, based on the distance to a set of landmarks. These distances
easily and interpretably map objects to a Euclidean space, are simple to
compute, and perform well in data analysis tasks. For trajectories, they match
and in some cases significantly out-perform all state-of-the-art other metrics,
can effortlessly be used in k-means clustering, and directly plugged into
approximate nearest neighbor approaches which immediately out-perform the best
recent advances in trajectory similarity search by several orders of magnitude.
These distances do not require a geometry distorting dual (common in the line
or halfspace case) or complicated alignment (common in trajectory case). We
show reasonable and often simple conditions under which these distances are
metrics.
