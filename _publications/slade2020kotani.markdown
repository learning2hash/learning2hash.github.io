In 1991, Shinichi Kotani proved a theorem giving a sufficient condition to
conclude that a function \(f(x)\) on \(\{\mathbb Z\}^d\) decays like \(|x|^\{-(d-2)\}\)
for large \(x\), assuming that its Fourier transform \(\hat f(k)\) is such that
\(|k|^\{2\}\hat f(k)\) is well behaved for \(k\) near zero. The proof was not
published. We prove an extension of Kotani's Theorem, based on Kotani's
unpublished proof.
