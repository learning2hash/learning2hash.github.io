Image compositions as a tool for analysis of artworks is of extreme
significance for art historians. These compositions are useful in analyzing the
interactions in an image to study artists and their artworks. Max Imdahl in his
work called Ikonik, along with other prominent art historians of the 20th
century, underlined the aesthetic and semantic importance of the structural
composition of an image. Understanding underlying compositional structures
within images is challenging and a time consuming task. Generating these
structures automatically using computer vision techniques (1) can help art
historians towards their sophisticated analysis by saving lot of time;
providing an overview and access to huge image repositories and (2) also
provide an important step towards an understanding of man made imagery by
machines. In this work, we attempt to automate this process using the existing
state of the art machine learning techniques, without involving any form of
training. Our approach, inspired by Max Imdahl's pioneering work, focuses on
two central themes of image composition: (a) detection of action regions and
action lines of the artwork; and (b) pose-based segmentation of foreground and
background. Currently, our approach works for artworks comprising of
protagonists (persons) in an image. In order to validate our approach
qualitatively and quantitatively, we conduct a user study involving experts and
non-experts. The outcome of the study highly correlates with our approach and
also demonstrates its domain-agnostic capability. We have open-sourced the code
