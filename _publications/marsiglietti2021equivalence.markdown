We establish quantitative comparisons between classical distances for
probability distributions belonging to the class of convex probability
measures. Distances include total variation distance, Wasserstein distance,
Kullback-Leibler distance and more general R\'enyi divergences. This extends a
result of Meckes and Meckes (2014).
