A common problem appearing across the field of data science is \\(k\\)-NN
(\\(k\\)-nearest neighbours), particularly within the context of Geographic
Information Systems. In this article, we present a novel data structure, the
GeoTree, which holds a collection of geohashes (string encodings of GPS
co-ordinates). This enables a constant \\(O\left(1\right)\\) time search algorithm
that returns a set of geohashes surrounding a given geohash in the GeoTree,
representing the approximate \\(k\\)-nearest neighbours of that geohash.
Furthermore, the GeoTree data structure retains \\(O\left(n\right)\\) memory
requirement. We apply the data structure to a property price index algorithm
focused on price comparison with historical neighbouring sales, demonstrating
an enhanced performance. The results show that this data structure allows for
the development of a real-time property price index, and can be scaled to
larger datasets with ease.
