We study the maximum cardinality problem of a set of few distances in the
Hamming and Johnson spaces. We formulate semidefinite programs for this problem
and extend the 2011 works by Barg-Musin and Musin-Nozaki. As our main result,
we find new parameters for which the maximum size of two- and three-distance
sets is known exactly.
