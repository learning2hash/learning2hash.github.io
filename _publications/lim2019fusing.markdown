Geo-tagged Twitter data has been used recently to infer insights on the human
aspects of social media. Insights related to demographics, spatial distribution
of cultural activities, space-time travel trajectories for humans as well as
happiness has been mined from geo-tagged twitter data in recent studies. To
date, not much study has been done on the impact of the geolocation features of
a Tweet on its sentiment. This observation has inspired us to propose the usage
of geo-location features as a method to perform sentiment classification. In
this method, the sentiment classification of geo-tagged tweets is performed by
concatenating geo-location features and one-hot encoded word vectors as inputs
for convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks. The addition of language-independent features in the form of
geo-location features has helped to enrich the tweet representation in order to
combat the sparse nature of short tweet message. The results achieved has
demonstrated that concatenating geo-location features to one-hot encoded word
vectors can achieve higher accuracy as compared to the usage of word vectors
alone for the purpose of sentiment classification.
