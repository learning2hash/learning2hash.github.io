Due to the wide diffusion of JPEG coding standard, the image forensic
community has devoted significant attention to the development of double JPEG
(DJPEG) compression detectors through the years. The ability of detecting
whether an image has been compressed twice provides paramount information
toward image authenticity assessment. Given the trend recently gained by
convolutional neural networks (CNN) in many computer vision tasks, in this
paper we propose to use CNNs for aligned and non-aligned double JPEG
compression detection. In particular, we explore the capability of CNNs to
capture DJPEG artifacts directly from images. Results show that the proposed
CNN-based detectors achieve good performance even with small size images (i.e.,
64x64), outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, especially in the non-aligned
case. Besides, good results are also achieved in the commonly-recognized
challenging case in which the first quality factor is larger than the second
one.
