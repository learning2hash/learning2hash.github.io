Representations of sets are challenging to learn because operations on sets
should be permutation-invariant. To this end, we propose a
Permutation-Optimisation module that learns how to permute a set end-to-end.
The permuted set can be further processed to learn a permutation-invariant
representation of that set, avoiding a bottleneck in traditional set models. We
demonstrate our model's ability to learn permutations and set representations
with either explicit or implicit supervision on four datasets, on which we
achieve state-of-the-art results: number sorting, image mosaics, classification
from image mosaics, and visual question answering.
