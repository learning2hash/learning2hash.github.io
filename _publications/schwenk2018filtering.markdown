We learn a joint multilingual sentence embedding and use the distance between
sentences in different languages to filter noisy parallel data and to mine for
parallel data in large news collections. We are able to improve a competitive
baseline on the WMT'14 English to German task by 0.3 BLEU by filtering out 25%
of the training data. The same approach is used to mine additional bitexts for
the WMT'14 system and to obtain competitive results on the BUCC shared task to
identify parallel sentences in comparable corpora. The approach is generic, it
can be applied to many language pairs and it is independent of the architecture
of the machine translation system.
