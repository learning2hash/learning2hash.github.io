In a recent application of the Bokeh Python library for visualizing
physico-chemical properties of chemical entities text-mined from the scientific
literature, we found ourselves facing the task of smoothing hexagonally binned
data in Cartesian coordinates. To the best of our knowledge, no documentation
for how to do this exist in the public domain. This short paper shows how to
accomplish this in general and for Bokeh in particular. We illustrate the
method with a real-world example and discuss some potential advantages of using
hexagonal bins in these and similar applications.
