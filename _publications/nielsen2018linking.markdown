The linkage of ImageNet WordNet synsets to Wikidata items will leverage deep
learning algorithm with access to a rich multilingual knowledge graph. Here I
will describe our on-going efforts in linking the two resources and issues
faced in matching the Wikidata and WordNet knowledge graphs. I show an example
on how the linkage can be used in a deep learning setting with real-time image
classification and labeling in a non-English language and discuss what
opportunities lies ahead.
