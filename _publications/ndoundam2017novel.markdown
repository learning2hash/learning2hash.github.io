We propose a new model of steganography based on a list of pseudo-randomly
sorted sequences of characters. Given a list \(L\) of \(m\) columns containing \(n\)
distinct strings each, with low or no semantic relationship between columns
taken two by two, and a secret message \(s \in \\{0,1\\}^*\), our model embeds \(s\)
in \(L\) block by block, by generating, for each column of \(L\), a permutation
number and by reordering strings contained in it according to that number.
Where, letting \(l\) be average bit length of a string, the embedding capacity is
given by \([(m-1)*log_2(n!-1)/n*l]\). We've shown that optimal efficiency of the
method can be obtained with the condition that \((n >> l)\). The results which
has been obtained by experiments, show that our model performs a better hiding
process than some of the important existing methods, in terms of hiding
capacity.
