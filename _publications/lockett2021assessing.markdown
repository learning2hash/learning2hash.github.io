Malware often uses obfuscation techniques or is modified slightly to evade
signature detection from antivirus software and malware analysis tools.
Traditionally, to determine if a file is malicious and identify what type of
malware a sample is, a cryptographic hash of a file is calculated. A more
recent and flexible solution for malware detection is YARA, which enables the
creation of rules to identify and classify malware based on a file's binary
patterns. In this paper, the author will critically evaluate the effectiveness
of YARA rules for signature-based detection and classification of malware in
comparison to alternative methods, which include cryptographic and fuzzy
hashing.
