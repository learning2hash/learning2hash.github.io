Malware often uses obfuscation techniques or is modified slightly to evade signature detection from antivirus software and malware analysis tools. Traditionally to determine if a file is malicious and identify what type of malware a sample is a cryptographic hash of a file is calculated. A more recent and flexible solution for malware detection is YARA which enables the creation of rules to identify and classify malware based on a files binary patterns. In this paper the author will critically evaluate the effectiveness of YARA rules for signature-based detection and classification of malware in comparison to alternative methods which include cryptographic and fuzzy hashing.
