This paper discusses the connection between the phase retrieval problem and
permutation invariant embeddings. We show that the real phase retrieval problem
for \(\mathbb\{R\}^d/O(1)\) is equivalent to Euclidean embeddings of the quotient
space \(\mathbb\{R\}^\{2\times d\}/S_2\) performed by the sorting encoder introduced
in an earlier work. In addition, this relationship provides us with inversion
algorithms of the orbits induced by the group of permutation matrices.
