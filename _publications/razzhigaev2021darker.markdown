Several methods for inversion of face recognition models were recently
presented, attempting to reconstruct a face from deep templates. Although some
of these approaches work in a black-box setup using only face embeddings,
usually, on the end-user side, only similarity scores are provided. Therefore,
these algorithms are inapplicable in such scenarios. We propose a novel
approach that allows reconstructing the face querying only similarity scores of
the black-box model. While our algorithm operates in a more general setup,
experiments show that it is query efficient and outperforms the existing
methods.
