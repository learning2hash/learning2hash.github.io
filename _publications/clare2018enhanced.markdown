In this note we consider the concept of alphabet ordering in the context of
string factoring. We propose a greedy-type algorithm which produces Lyndon
factorizations with small numbers of factors along with a modification for
large numbers of factors. For the technique we introduce the Exponent Parikh
vector. Applications and research directions derived from circ-UMFFs are
discussed.
