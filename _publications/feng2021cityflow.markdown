Natural Language (NL) descriptions can be one of the most convenient or the
only way to interact with systems built to understand and detect city scale
traffic patterns and vehicle-related events. In this paper, we extend the
widely adopted CityFlow Benchmark with NL descriptions for vehicle targets and
introduce the CityFlow-NL Benchmark. The CityFlow-NL contains more than 5,000
unique and precise NL descriptions of vehicle targets, making it the first
multi-target multi-camera tracking with NL descriptions dataset to our
knowledge. Moreover, the dataset facilitates research at the intersection of
multi-object tracking, retrieval by NL descriptions, and temporal localization
of events. In this paper, we focus on two foundational tasks: the Vehicle
Retrieval by NL task and the Vehicle Tracking by NL task, which take advantage
of the proposed CityFlow-NL benchmark and provide a strong basis for future
research on the multi-target multi-camera tracking by NL description task.
