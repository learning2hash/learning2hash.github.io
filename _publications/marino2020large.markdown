This paper presents a linear prioritized local algorithm that computes large
independent sets on a random \\(d\\)-regular graph with small and fixed degree \\(d\\).
We studied experimentally the independence ratio obtained by the algorithm when
\\( d \in [3,100]\\). For all \\(d \in [5,100]\\), our results are larger than lower
bounds calculated by exact methods, thus providing improved estimates of lower
bounds.
