The interest in offensive content identification in social media has grown
substantially in recent years. Previous work has dealt mostly with post level
annotations. However, identifying offensive spans is useful in many ways. To
help coping with this important challenge, we present MUDES, a multilingual
system to detect offensive spans in texts. MUDES features pre-trained models, a
Python API for developers, and a user-friendly web-based interface. A detailed
description of MUDES' components is presented in this paper.
