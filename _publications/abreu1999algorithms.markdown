The free distance of a convolutional code is a reliable indicator of its
performance. However its computation is not an easy task. In this paper, we
present some algorithms to compute the free distance with good efficiency that
work for convolutional codes of all rates and over any field. Furthermore we
discuss why an algorithm which is claimed to be very efficient is incorrect.
