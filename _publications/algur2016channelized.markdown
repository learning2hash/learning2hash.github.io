The Color is one of the most important and easily identifiable features for
describing the visual content. The MPEG standard has developed a number of
descriptors that covers different aspects of the visual content. The Dominant
color descriptor is one of them. This paper proposes a channelized binning
approach a novel method for extraction of the dominant color pixel value which
is a variant of the dominant color descriptor. The Channelized binning method
treats the problem as a statistical problem and tries to avoid color
quantization and interpolation guessing of number and centroid of dominant
colors. Channelized binning is an iterative approach which automatically
estimates the number of dominant pixel values and their centroids. It operates
on 24 bit full RGB color space, by considering one color channel at a time and
hence avoiding the color quantization. Results show that the proposed method
can successfully extract dominant color pixel values.
