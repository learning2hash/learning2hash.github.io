Due to its promising classification performance, sparse representation based
classification(SRC) algorithm has attracted great attention in the past few
years. However, the existing SRC type methods apply only to vector data in
Euclidean space. As such, there is still no satisfactory approach to conduct
classification task for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which is
very useful in computer vision. To address this problem, in this paper, a
neighborhood preserved kernel SRC method is proposed on SPD manifolds.
Specifically, by embedding the SPD matrices into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Space (RKHS), the proposed method can perform classification on SPD manifolds
through an appropriate Log-Euclidean kernel. Through exploiting the geodesic
distance between SPD matrices, our method can effectively characterize the
intrinsic local Riemannian geometry within data so as to well unravel the
underlying sub-manifold structure. Despite its simplicity, experimental results
on several famous database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better
classification results than the state-of-the-art approaches.
