The problem of landmark recognition has achieved excellent results in
small-scale datasets. When dealing with large-scale retrieval, issues that were
irrelevant with small amount of data, quickly become fundamental for an
efficient retrieval phase. In particular, computational time needs to be kept
as low as possible, whilst the retrieval accuracy has to be preserved as much
as possible. In this paper we propose a novel multi-index hashing method called
Bag of Indexes (BoI) for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search. It allows
to drastically reduce the query time and outperforms the accuracy results
compared to the state-of-the-art methods for large-scale landmark recognition.
It has been demonstrated that this family of algorithms can be applied on
different embedding techniques like VLAD and R-MAC obtaining excellent results
in very short times on different public datasets: Holidays+Flickr1M, Oxford105k
and Paris106k.
