Document digitization is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we
propose a shape based approach for automatic stamp verification/detection in
document images using an unsupervised feature learning. Given a small set of
training images, our algorithm learns an appropriate shape representation using
an unsupervised clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our framework in challenging scenarios.
