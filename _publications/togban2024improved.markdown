To display an image, the color space in which the image is encoded is assumed
to be known. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely realistic. In this paper,
we propose to identify the color space of a given color image using pixel
embedding and the Gaussian process. Five color spaces are supported, namely
Adobe RGB, Apple RGB, ColorMatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB and sRGB. The results
obtained show that this problem deserves more efforts.
