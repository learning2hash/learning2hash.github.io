<p>In 1733, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in France, set the
ground of geometric probability theory by defining an enlightening
problem: What is the probability that a needle thrown randomly on a
ground made of equispaced parallel strips lies on two of them? In this
work, we show that the solution to this problem, and its generalization
to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> dimensions, allows us to
discover a quantized form of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i.e.,
one that combines a linear dimensionality reduction procedure with a
uniform quantization of precision <span
class="math inline">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span>. In particular, given a
finite set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal S \subset
\mathbb R^N\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> points
and a distortion level <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span>, as soon as <span
class="math inline">\(M &gt;
M_0 = O(\epsilon^{-2} \log S)\)</span>, we can (randomly) construct a
mapping from <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal S, \ell_2)\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\((\delta\mathbb Z^M, \ell_1)\)</span> that
approximately preserves the pairwise distances between the points of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal S\)</span>. Interestingly, compared
to the common JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric and we observe
both an additive and a multiplicative distortions on the embedded
distances. These two distortions, however, decay as <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{(\log
S)/M})\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> increases.
Moreover, for coarse quantization, i.e., for high <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> compared to the set radius, the
distortion is mainly additive, while for small <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> we tend to a Lipschitz isometric
embedding. Finally, we prove the existence of a “nearly” quasi-isometric
embedding of <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal S,
\ell_2)\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\((\delta\mathbb Z^M,
\ell_2)\)</span>. This one involves a non-linear distortion of the <span
class="math inline">\(\ell_2\)</span>-distance in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal S\)</span> that vanishes for distant
points in this set. Noticeably, the additive distortion in this case is
slower, and decays as <span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt[4]{(\log
S)/M})\)</span>.</p>
