In 1733, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in France, set the ground of geometric probability theory by defining an enlightening problem: What is the probability that a needle thrown randomly on a ground made of equispaced parallel strips lies on two of them? In this work, we show that the solution to this problem, and its generalization to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(N\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} dimensions, allows us to discover a quantized form of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i.e., one that combines a linear dimensionality reduction procedure with a uniform quantization of precision \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta>0\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. In particular, given a finite set $\mathcal S \subset \mathbb R^N\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( of \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}S\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( points and a distortion level \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\epsilon>0\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(, as soon as \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}M > M\_0 = O(\epsilon^\{-2\} \log S)$, we can (randomly) construct a mapping from \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((\mathcal S, \ell\_2)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} to \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((\delta\mathbb Z^M, \ell\_1)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} that approximately preserves the pairwise distances between the points of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal S\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Interestingly, compared to the common JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric and we observe both an additive and a multiplicative distortions on the embedded distances. These two distortions, however, decay as $O(\sqrt\{(\log S)/M\})\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( when \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}M$ increases. Moreover, for coarse quantization, i.e., for high \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} compared to the set radius, the distortion is mainly additive, while for small \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\delta\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} we tend to a Lipschitz isometric embedding. Finally, we prove the existence of a nearly quasi-isometric embedding of $(\mathcal S, \ell\_2)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\( into \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}(\delta\mathbb Z^M, \ell\_2)$. This one involves a non-linear distortion of the \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-distance in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\mathcal S\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} that vanishes for distant points in this set. Noticeably, the additive distortion in this case is slower, and decays as \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(\sqrt[4]\{(\log S)/M\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
