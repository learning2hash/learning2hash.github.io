Prototype-based methods are of the particular interest for domain specialists
and practitioners as they summarize a dataset by a small set of
representatives. Therefore, in a classification setting, interpretability of
the prototypes is as significant as the prediction accuracy of the algorithm.
Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods make inefficient trade-offs between
these concerns by sacrificing one in favor of the other, especially if the
given data has a kernel-based representation. In this paper, we propose a novel
interpretable multiple-kernel prototype learning (IMKPL) to construct highly
interpretable prototypes in the feature space, which are also efficient for the
discriminative representation of the data. Our method focuses on the local
discrimination of the classes in the feature space and shaping the prototypes
based on condensed class-homogeneous neighborhoods of data. Besides, IMKPL
learns a combined embedding in the feature space in which the above objectives
are better fulfilled. When the base kernels coincide with the data dimensions,
this embedding results in a discriminative features selection. We evaluate
IMKPL on several benchmarks from different domains which demonstrate its
superiority to the related state-of-the-art methods regarding both
interpretability and discriminative representation.
