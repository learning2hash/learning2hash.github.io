For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.
