We introduce FindingEmo, a new image dataset containing annotations for 25k
images, specifically tailored to Emotion Recognition. Contrary to existing
datasets, it focuses on complex scenes depicting multiple people in various
naturalistic, social settings, with images being annotated as a whole, thereby
going beyond the traditional focus on faces or single individuals. Annotated
dimensions include Valence, Arousal and Emotion label, with annotations
gathered using Prolific. Together with the annotations, we release the list of
URLs pointing to the original images, as well as all associated source code.
