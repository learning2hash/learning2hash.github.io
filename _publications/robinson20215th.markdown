Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW), held as a data challenge in
conjunction with the 16th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and
Gesture Recognition (FG), is a large-scale, multi-track visual kinship
recognition evaluation. For the fifth edition of RFIW, we continue to attract
scholars, bring together professionals, publish new work, and discuss
prospects. In this paper, we summarize submissions for the three tasks of this
year's RFIW: specifically, we review the results for kinship verification,
tri-subject verification, and family member search and retrieval. We look at
the RFIW problem, share current efforts, and make recommendations for promising
future directions.
