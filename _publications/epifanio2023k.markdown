In this paper we consider the weighted \(k\)-Hamming and \(k\)-Edit distances,
that are natural generalizations of the classical Hamming and Edit distances.
As main results of this paper we prove that for any \(k\geq 2\) the
DECIS-\(k\)-Hamming problem is \(\mathbb\{P\}\)-SPACE-complete and the DECIS-\(k\)-Edit
problem is NEXPTIME-complete.
