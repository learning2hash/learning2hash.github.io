Nearest neighbor search is a problem of finding the data points from the
database such that the distances from them to the query point are the smallest.
Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been
widely studied recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of
preserving the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise
similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization,
and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity
preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as
we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition,
we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and
point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of
search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost. Finally, we introduce a few
emerging topics.
