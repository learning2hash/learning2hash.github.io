Matching datasets of multiple modalities has become an important task in data
analysis. Existing methods often rely on the embedding and transformation of
each single modality without utilizing any correspondence information, which
often results in sub-optimal matching performance. In this paper, we propose a
nonlinear manifold matching algorithm using shortest-path distance and joint
neighborhood selection. Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built
for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is
calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and
matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing
algorithms, our approach exhibits superior performance for matching disparate
datasets of multiple modalities.
