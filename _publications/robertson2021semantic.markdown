The semantics of emoji has, to date, been considered from a static
perspective. We offer the first longitudinal study of how emoji semantics
changes over time, applying techniques from computational linguistics to six
years of Twitter data. We identify five patterns in emoji semantic development
and find evidence that the less abstract an emoji is, the more likely it is to
undergo semantic change. In addition, we analyse select emoji in more detail,
examining the effect of seasonality and world events on emoji semantics. To aid
future work on emoji and semantics, we make our data publicly available along
with a web-based interface that anyone can use to explore semantic change in
emoji.
