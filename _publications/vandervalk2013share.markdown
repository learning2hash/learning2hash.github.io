Here we describe the SHARE system, a web service based framework for
distributed querying and reasoning on the semantic web. The main innovations of
SHARE are: (1) the extension of a SPARQL query engine to perform on-demand data
retrieval from web services, and (2) the extension of an OWL reasoner to test
property restrictions by means of web service invocations. In addition to
enabling queries across distributed datasets, the system allows for a target
dataset that is significantly larger than is possible under current,
centralized approaches. Although the architecture is equally applicable to all
types of data, the SHARE system targets bioinformatics, due to the large number
of interoperable web services that are already available in this area. SHARE is
built entirely on semantic web standards, and is the successor of the BioMOBY
project.
