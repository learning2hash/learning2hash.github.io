In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding
with unit norm code vectors where reconstruction quality is evaluated using an
inner product (cosine distance). To use these codes for discriminative
classification, we describe a model we term Energy-Based Spherical Sparse
Coding (EB-SSC) in which the hypothesized class label introduces a learned
linear bias into the coding step. We evaluate and visualize performance of
stacking this encoder to make a deep layered model for image classification.
