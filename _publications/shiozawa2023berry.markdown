We obtain the uniform convergence rate for the Gaussian fluctuation of the
radial part of the Brownian motion on a hyperbolic space. We also show that
this result is sharp if the dimension of the hyperbolic space is two or general
odd. Our approach is based on the repetitive use of the Millson formula and the
integration by parts formula.
