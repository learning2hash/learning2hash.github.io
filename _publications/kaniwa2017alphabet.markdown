Suffix trees have recently become very successful data structures in handling
large data sequences such as DNA or Protein sequences. Consequently parallel
architectures have become ubiquitous. We present a novel alphabet-dependent
parallel algorithm which attempts to take advantage of the perverseness of the
multicore architecture. Microsatellites are important for their biological
relevance hence our algorithm is based on time efficient construction for
identification of such. We experimentally achieved up to 15x speedup over the
sequential algorithm on different input sizes of biological sequences.
