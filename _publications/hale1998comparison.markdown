This paper presents the results of using Roget's International Thesaurus as
the taxonomy in a semantic similarity measurement task. Four similarity metrics
were taken from the literature and applied to Roget's The experimental
evaluation suggests that the traditional edge counting approach does
surprisingly well (a correlation of r=0.88 with a benchmark set of human
similarity judgements, with an upper bound of r=0.90 for human subjects
performing the same task.)
