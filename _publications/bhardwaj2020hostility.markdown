In this paper, we present a novel hostility detection dataset in Hindi
language. We collect and manually annotate ~8200 online posts. The annotated
dataset covers four hostility dimensions: fake news, hate speech, offensive,
and defamation posts, along with a non-hostile label. The hostile posts are
also considered for multi-label tags due to a significant overlap among the
hostile classes. We release this dataset as part of the CONSTRAINT-2021 shared
task on hostile post detection.
