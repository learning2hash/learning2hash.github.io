<p>Current state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS)
algorithms generate indices that must be stored in main memory for fast
high-recall search. This makes them expensive and limits the size of the
dataset. We present a new graph-based indexing and search system called
DiskANN that can index, store, and search a billion point database on a
single workstation with just 64GB RAM and an inexpensive solid-state
drive (SSD). Contrary to current wisdom, we demonstrate that the
SSD-based indices built by DiskANN can meet all three desiderata for
large-scale ANNS: high-recall, low query latency and high density
(points indexed per node). On the billion point SIFT1B bigann dataset,
DiskANN serves &gt; 5000 queries a second with &lt; 3ms mean latency and
95%+ 1-recall@1 on a 16 core machine, where state-of-the-art
billion-point ANNS algorithms with similar memory footprint like FAISS
and IVFOADC+G+P plateau at around 50% 1-recall@1. Alternately, in the
high recall regime, DiskANN can index and serve 5 âˆ’ 10x more points per
node compared to state-of-the-art graph- based methods such as HNSW and
NSG. Finally, as part of our overall DiskANN system, we introduce
Vamana, a new graph-based ANNS index that is more versatile than the
graph indices even for in-memory indices.</p>
