We present a visualization tool to exhaustively search and browse through a
set of large-scale machine learning datasets. Built on the top of the VizWiz
dataset, our dataset browser tool has the potential to support and enable a
variety of qualitative and quantitative research, and open new directions for
visualizing and researching with multimodal information. The tool is publicly
available at https://vizwiz.org/browse.
