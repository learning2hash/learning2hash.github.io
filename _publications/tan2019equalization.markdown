Recent object detection and instance segmentation tasks mainly focus on
datasets with a relatively small set of categories, e.g. Pascal VOC with 20
classes and COCO with 80 classes. The new large vocabulary dataset LVIS brings
new challenges to conventional methods. In this work, we propose an
equalization loss to solve the long tail of rare categories problem. Combined
with exploiting the data from detection datasets to alleviate the effect of
missing-annotation problems during the training, our method achieves 5.1%
overall AP gain and 11.4% AP gain of rare categories on LVIS benchmark without
any bells and whistles compared to Mask R-CNN baseline. Finally we achieve 28.9
mask AP on the test-set of the LVIS and rank 1st place in LVIS Challenge 2019.
