In this study, we investigate interaction-based neural matching models for
ad-hoc cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) using cross-lingual word
embeddings (CLWEs). With experiments conducted on the CLEF collection over four
language pairs, we evaluate and provide insight into different neural model
architectures, different ways to represent query-document interactions and
word-pair similarity distributions in CLIR. This study paves the way for
learning an end-to-end CLIR system using CLWEs.
