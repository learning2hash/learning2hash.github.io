We present a new, simple, and efficient approach for computing the Lempel-Ziv
(LZ77) factorization of a string in linear time, based on suffix arrays.
Computational experiments on various data sets show that our approach
constantly outperforms the currently fastest algorithm LZ OG (Ohlebusch and Gog
2011), and can be up to 2 to 3 times faster in the processing after obtaining
the suffix array, while requiring the same or a little more space.
