Visual understanding of complex urban street scenes is an enabling factor for
a wide range of applications. Object detection has benefited enormously from
large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic
urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the
complexity of real-world urban scenes.
  To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale
dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level
semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo
video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these
images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have
coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of
weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms
of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our
accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset
characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several
state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.
