We present a Few-Shot Relation Classification Dataset (FewRel), consisting of
70, 000 sentences on 100 relations derived from Wikipedia and annotated by
crowdworkers. The relation of each sentence is first recognized by distant
supervision methods, and then filtered by crowdworkers. We adapt the most
recent state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for relation classification
and conduct a thorough evaluation of these methods. Empirical results show that
even the most competitive few-shot learning models struggle on this task,
especially as compared with humans. We also show that a range of different
reasoning skills are needed to solve our task. These results indicate that
few-shot relation classification remains an open problem and still requires
further research. Our detailed analysis points multiple directions for future
research. All details and resources about the dataset and baselines are
released on http://zhuhao.me/fewrel.
