With the development of Internet culture, cuteness has become a popular
concept. Many people are curious about what factors making a person look cute.
However, there is rare research to answer this interesting question. In this
work, we construct a dataset of personal images with comprehensively annotated
cuteness scores and facial attributes to investigate this high-level concept in
depth. Based on this dataset, through an automatic attributes mining process,
we find several critical attributes determining the cuteness of a person. We
also develop a novel Continuous Latent Support Vector Machine (C-LSVM) method
to predict the cuteness score of one person given only his image. Extensive
evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cuteness
prediction.
