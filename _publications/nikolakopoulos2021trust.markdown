Collaborative recommendation approaches based on nearest-neighbors are still
highly popular today due to their simplicity, their efficiency, and their
ability to produce accurate and personalized recommendations. This chapter
offers a comprehensive survey of neighborhood-based methods for the item
recommendation problem. It presents the main characteristics and benefits of
such methods, describes key design choices for implementing a
neighborhood-based recommender system, and gives practical information on how
to make these choices. A broad range of methods is covered in the chapter,
including traditional algorithms like k-nearest neighbors as well as advanced
approaches based on matrix factorization, sparse coding and random walks.
