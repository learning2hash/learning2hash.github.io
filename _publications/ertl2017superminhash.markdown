This paper presents a new algorithm for calculating hash signatures of sets
which can be directly used for Jaccard similarity estimation. The new approach
is an improvement over the MinHash algorithm, because it has a better runtime
behavior and the resulting signatures allow a more precise estimation of the
Jaccard index.
