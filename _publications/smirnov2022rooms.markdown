In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of room interior pictures with
overlaying and scene text, totalling to 4836 annotated images in 25 product
categories. We provide details on the collection and annotation process of our
dataset, and analyze its statistics. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method
for overlaying text detection, that leverages the character region-aware text
detection framework to guide the classification model. We validate our approach
and show its efficiency in terms of binary classification metrics, reaching the
final performance of 0.95 F1 score, with false positive and false negative
rates of 0.02 and 0.06 correspondingly.
