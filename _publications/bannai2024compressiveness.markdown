The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is a reversible transform that converts a
string \(w\) into another string \(\mathsf\{BWT\}(w)\). The size of the run-length
encoded BWT (RLBWT) can be interpreted as a measure of repetitiveness in the
class of representations called dictionary compression which are essentially
representations based on copy and paste operations. In this paper, we shed new
light on the compressiveness of BWT and the bijective BWT (BBWT). We first
extend previous results on the relations of their run-length compressed sizes
\(r\) and \(r_B\). We also show that the so-called ``clustering effect'' of BWT and
BBWT can be captured by measures other than empirical entropy or run-length
encoding. In particular, we show that BWT and BBWT do not increase the
repetitiveness of the string with respect to various measures based on
dictionary compression by more than a polylogarithmic factor. Furthermore, we
show that there exists an infinite family of strings that are maximally
incompressible by any dictionary compression measure, but become very
compressible after applying BBWT. An interesting implication of this result is
that it is possible to transcend dictionary compression in some cases by simply
applying BBWT before applying dictionary compression.
