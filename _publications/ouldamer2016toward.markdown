This paper presents preliminary works on using Word Embedding (word2vec) for
query expansion in the context of Personalized Information Retrieval.
Traditionally, word embeddings are learned on a general corpus, like Wikipedia.
In this work we try to personalize the word embeddings learning, by achieving
the learning on the user's profile. The word embeddings are then in the same
context than the user interests. Our proposal is evaluated on the CLEF Social
Book Search 2016 collection. The results obtained show that some efforts should
be made in the way to apply Word Embedding in the context of Personalized
Information Retrieval.
