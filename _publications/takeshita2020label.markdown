Our daily life is surrounded by textual information. Nowadays, the automatic
collection of textual information becomes possible owing to the drastic
improvement of scene text detectors and recognizer. The purpose of this paper
is to conduct a large-scale survey of co-occurrence between visual objects
(such as book and car) and scene texts with a large image dataset and a
state-of-the-art scene text detector and recognizer. Especially, we focus on
the function of "label" texts, which are attached to objects for detailing the
objects. By analyzing co-occurrence between objects and scene texts, it is
possible to observe the statistics about the label texts and understand how the
scene texts will be useful for recognizing the objects and vice versa.
