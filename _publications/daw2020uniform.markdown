Let \(B =\\{ B_t \, : \, t \geq 0 \\}\) be a real-valued fractional Brownian
motion of index \(H \in (0,1)\). We prove that the macroscopic Hausdorff
dimension of the level sets \(\mathcal\{L\}_x = \left\\{ t \in \mathbb\{R\}_+ \, : \,
B_t=x \right\\}\) is, with probability one, equal to \(1-H\) for all
\(x\in\mathbb\{R\}\).
