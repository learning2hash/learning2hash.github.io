In this paper, we propose a new method for query expansion, which uses
FarsNet (Persian WordNet) to find similar tokens related to the query and
expand the semantic meaning of the query. For this purpose, we use synonymy
relations in FarsNet and extract the related synonyms to query words. This
algorithm is used to enhance information retrieval systems and improve search
results. The overall evaluation of this system in comparison to the baseline
method (without using query expansion) shows an improvement of about 9 percent
in Mean Average Precision (MAP).
