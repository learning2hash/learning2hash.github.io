In this paper, we study the codes \(\mathcal C_k(n,q)\) arising from the
incidence of points and \(k\)-spaces in \(\text\{PG\}(n,q)\) over the field \(\mathbb
F_p\), with \(q = p^h\), \(p\) prime. We classify all codewords of minimum weight of
the dual code \(\mathcal C_k(n,q)^\perp\) in case \(q \in \\{4,8\\}\). This is
equivalent to classifying the smallest sets of even type in \(\text\{PG\}(n,q)\)
for \(q \in \\{4,8\\}\). We also provide shorter proofs for some already known
results, namely of the best known lower bound on the minimum weight of
\(\mathcal C_k(n,q)^\perp\) for general values of \(q\), and of the classification
of all codewords of \(\mathcal C_\{n-1\}(n,q)\) of weight up to \(2q^\{n-1\}\).
