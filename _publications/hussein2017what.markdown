A fuzzy system was created in MATLAB to identify an item of clothing as a
dress, shirt, or pair of pants from a series of input images. The system was
initialized using a high-contrast vector-image of each item of clothing as the
state closest to a direct solution. Nine other user-input images (three of each
item) were also used to determine the characteristic function of each item and
recognize each pattern. Mamdani inference systems were used for edge location
and identification of characteristic regions of interest for each item of
clothing. Based on these non-dimensional trends, a second Mamdani fuzzy
inference system was used to characterize each image as containing a shirt, a
dress, or a pair of pants. An outline of the fuzzy inference system and image
processing techniques used for creating an image pattern recognition system are
discussed.
