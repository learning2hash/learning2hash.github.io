The analysis of the spatial arrangement of colors and roughness/smoothness of
figures is relevant due to its wide range of applications. This paper proposes
a texture classification method that extracts data from images using the
Hilbert curve. Three information theory quantifiers are then computed:
permutation entropy, permutation complexity, and Fisher information measure.
The proposal exhibits some important properties: (i) it allows to discriminate
figures according to varying degrees of correlations (as measured by the Hurst
exponent), (ii) it is invariant to rotation and symmetry transformations, (iii)
it can be used either in black and white or color images. Validations have been
made not only using synthetic images but also using the well-known Brodatz
image database.
