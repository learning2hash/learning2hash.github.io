Research on automated, image based identification of clothing categories and
fashion landmarks has recently gained significant interest due to its potential
impact on areas such as robotic clothing manipulation, automated clothes
sorting and recycling, and online shopping. Several public and annotated
fashion datasets have been created to facilitate research advances in this
direction. In this work, we make the first step towards leveraging the data and
techniques developed for fashion image analysis in vision-based robotic
clothing manipulation tasks. We focus on techniques that can generalize from
large-scale fashion datasets to less structured, small datasets collected in a
robotic lab. Specifically, we propose training data augmentation methods such
as elastic warping, and model adjustments such as rotation invariant
convolutions to make the model generalize better. Our experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms stateof-the art models with respect to clothing
category classification and fashion landmark detection when tested on
previously unseen datasets. Furthermore, we present experimental results on a
new dataset composed of images where a robot holds different garments,
collected in our lab.
