Mallows and Riordan showed in 1968 that labeled trees with a small number of inversions are related to labeled graphs that are connected and sparse. Wright enumerated sparse connected graphs in 1977 and Kreweras related the inversions of trees to the so-called ``parking problem in 1980. A~combination of these three results leads to a surprisingly simple analysis of the behavior of hashing by linear probing including higher moments of the cost of successful search.
