SNS providers are known to carry out the recompression and resizing of
uploaded videos/images, but most conventional methods for detecting tampered
videos/images are not robust enough against such operations. In addition,
videos are temporally operated such as the insertion of new frames and the
permutation of frames, of which operations are difficult to be detected by
using conventional methods. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel
method with a robust hashing algorithm for detecting temporally operated videos
even when applying resizing and compression to the videos.
