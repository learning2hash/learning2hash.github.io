Let (A_q(nd)) be the maximum order (maximum number of codewords) of a (q)-ary code of length (n) and Hamming distance at least (d). And let (A(ndw)) that of a binary code of constant weight (w). Building on results from algebraic graph theory and ErdHos-ko-Rado like theorems in extremal combinatorics we show how several known bounds on (A_q(nd)) and (A(ndw)) can be easily obtained in a single framework. For instance both the Hamming and Singleton bounds can derived as an application of a property relating the clique number and the independence number of vertex transitive graphs. Using the same techniques we also derive some new bounds and present some additional applications.
