<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A_q(n,d)\)</span> be the maximum
order (maximum number of codewords) of a <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-ary code of length <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and Hamming distance at least <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. And let <span
class="math inline">\(A(n,d,w)\)</span> that of a binary code of
constant weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Building on
results from algebraic graph theory and Erds-ko-Rado like theorems in
extremal combinatorics, we show how several known bounds on <span
class="math inline">\(A_q(n,d)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A(n,d,w)\)</span> can be easily obtained in a
single framework. For instance, both the Hamming and Singleton bounds
can derived as an application of a property relating the clique number
and the independence number of vertex transitive graphs. Using the same
techniques, we also derive some new bounds and present some additional
applications.</p>
