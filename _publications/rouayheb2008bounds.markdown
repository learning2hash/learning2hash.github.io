Let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A\_q(n,d)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} be the maximum order (maximum number of codewords) of a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(q\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-ary code of length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and Hamming distance at least \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. And let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(n,d,w)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} that of a binary code of constant weight \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(w\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Building on results from algebraic graph theory and Erd\H\{o\}s-ko-Rado like theorems in extremal combinatorics, we show how several known bounds on \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A\_q(n,d)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A(n,d,w)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} can be easily obtained in a single framework. For instance, both the Hamming and Singleton bounds can derived as an application of a property relating the clique number and the independence number of vertex transitive graphs. Using the same techniques, we also derive some new bounds and present some additional applications.
