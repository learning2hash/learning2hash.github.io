We study the convex relaxation of clustering and hamming embedding focusing on the asymmetric case (co-clustering and asymmetric hamming embedding) understanding their relationship to LSH as studied by (Charikar 2002) and to the max-norm ball and the differences between their symmetric and asymmetric versions.
