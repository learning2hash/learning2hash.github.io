Let \(\\{B(\xi_n,r_n)\\}_\{n\ge1\}\) be a sequence of random balls whose centers
\(\\{\xi_n\\}_\{n\ge1\}\) is a stationary process, and \(\\{r_n\\}_\{n\ge1\}\) is a
sequence of positive numbers decreasing to 0. Our object is the random covering
set \(E=\limsup\limits_\{n\to\infty\}B(\xi_n,r_n)\), that is, the points covered by
\(B(\xi_n,r_n)\) infinitely often. The sizes of \(E\) are investigated from the
viewpoint of measure, dimension and topology.
