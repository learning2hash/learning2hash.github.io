We introduce the Symplectic Grassmann codes as projective codes defined by
symplectic Grassmannians, in analogy with the orthogonal Grassmann codes
introduced in [4]. Note that the Lagrangian-Grassmannian codes are a special
class of Symplectic Grassmann codes. We describe the weight enumerator of the
Lagrangian--Grassmannian codes of rank \(2\) and \(3\) and we determine the minimum
distance of the line Symplectic Grassmann codes.
