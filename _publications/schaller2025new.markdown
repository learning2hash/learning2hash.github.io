Non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions have recently attracted a lot
of attention. In this work, we focus on multiplicity-free codes, a family of
non-binary codes where all symbols are distinct. Our main contribution is a new
explicit construction of such codes, based on set and permutation codes. We
show that our multiplicity-free codes can correct multiple deletions and
provide a decoding algorithm. We also show that, for a certain regime of
parameters, our constructed codes have size larger than all the previously
known non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions.
