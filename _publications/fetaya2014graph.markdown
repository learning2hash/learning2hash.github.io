We consider the problem of learning from a similarity matrix (such as
spectral clustering and lowd imensional embedding), when computing pairwise
similarities are costly, and only a limited number of entries can be observed.
We provide a theoretical analysis using standard notions of graph
approximation, significantly generalizing previous results (which focused on
spectral clustering with two clusters). We also propose a new algorithmic
approach based on adaptive sampling, which experimentally matches or improves
on previous methods, while being considerably more general and computationally
cheaper.
