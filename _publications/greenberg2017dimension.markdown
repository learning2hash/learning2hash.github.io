We show that a sequence has effective Hausdorff dimension 1 if and only if it
is coarsely similar to a Martin-L\"\{o\}f random sequence. More generally, a
sequence has effective dimension \(s\) if and only if it is coarsely similar to a
weakly \(s\)-random sequence. Further, for any \(s<t\), every sequence of effective
dimension \(s\) can be changed on density at most \(H^\{-1\}(t)-H^\{-1\}(s)\) of its
bits to produce a sequence of effective dimension \(t\), and this bound is
optimal.
