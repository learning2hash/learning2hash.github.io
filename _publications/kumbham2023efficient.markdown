Video lectures are becoming more popular and in demand as online classroom
teaching is becoming more prevalent. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such
as NPTEL, have been creating high-quality educational content that is freely
accessible to students online. A large number of colleges across the country
are now using NPTEL videos in their classrooms. So more video lectures are
being recorded, maintained, and uploaded. These videos generally contain
information about that video before the lecture begins. We generally observe
that these educational videos have metadata containing five to six attributes:
Institute Name, Publisher Name, Department Name, Professor Name, Subject Name,
and Topic Name. It would be easy to maintain these videos if we could organize
them according to their categories. The indexing of these videos based on this
information is beneficial for students all around the world to efficiently
utilise these videos. In this project, we are trying to get the metadata
information mentioned above from the video lectures.
