In fashion e-commerce platforms, product discovery is one of the key
components of a good user experience. There are numerous ways using which
people find the products they desire. Similar product recommendations is one of
the popular modes using which users find products that resonate with their
intent. Generally these recommendations are not personalized to a specific
user. Traditionally, collaborative filtering based approaches have been popular
in the literature for recommending non-personalized products given a query
product. Also, there has been focus on personalizing the product listing for a
given user. In this paper, we marry these approaches so that users will be
recommended with personalized similar products. Our experimental results on a
large fashion e-commerce platform (Myntra) show that we can improve the key
metrics by applying personalization on similar product recommendations.
