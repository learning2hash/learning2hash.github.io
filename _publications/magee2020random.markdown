Let \\(X\\) be a compact connected hyperbolic surface, that is, a closed
connected orientable smooth surface with a Riemannian metric of constant
curvature -1. For each \\(n\in\mathbf\{N\}\\), let \\(X_\{n\}\\) be a random degree-\\(n\\)
cover of \\(X\\) sampled uniformly from all degree-\\(n\\) Riemannian covering spaces
of \\(X\\). An eigenvalue of \\(X\\) or \\(X_\{n\}\\) is an eigenvalue of the associated
Laplacian operator \\(\Delta_\{X\}\\) or \\(\Delta_\{X_\{n\}\}\\). We say that an eigenvalue
of \\(X_n\\) is new if it occurs with greater multiplicity than in \\(X\\). We prove
that for any \\(\epsilon>0\\), with probability tending to 1 as \\(n\to\infty\\),
there are no new eigenvalues of \\(X_n\\) below \\(\frac\{3\}\{16\}-\epsilon\\). We
conjecture that the same result holds with \\(\frac\{3\}\{16\}\\) replaced by
\\(\frac\{1\}\{4\}\\).
