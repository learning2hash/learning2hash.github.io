Event recognition from still images is of great importance for image
understanding. However, compared with event recognition in videos, there are
much fewer research works on event recognition in images. This paper addresses
the issue of event recognition from images and proposes an effective method
with deep neural networks. Specifically, we design a new architecture, called
Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Network (OS-CNN). This architecture is
decomposed into object net and scene net, which extract useful information for
event understanding from the perspective of objects and scene context,
respectively. Meanwhile, we investigate different network architectures for
OS-CNN design, and adapt the deep (AlexNet) and very-deep (GoogLeNet) networks
to the task of event recognition. Furthermore, we find that the deep and
very-deep networks are complementary to each other. Finally, based on the
proposed OS-CNN and comparative study of different network architectures, we
come up with a solution of five-stream CNN for the track of cultural event
recognition at the ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge 2015. Our method
obtains the performance of 85.5% and ranks the \(1^\{st\}\) place in this
challenge.
