Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) is the earliest mature writing system in China,
which represents a crucial stage in the development of hieroglyphs.
Nevertheless, the substantial quantity of undeciphered OBI characters remains a
significant challenge for scholars, while conventional methods of ancient
script research are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we
propose a cross-font image retrieval network (CFIRN) to decipher OBI characters
by establishing associations between OBI characters and other script forms,
simulating the interpretive behavior of paleography scholars. Concretely, our
network employs a siamese framework to extract deep features from character
images of various fonts, fully exploring structure clues with different
resolutions by multiscale feature integration (MFI) module and multiscale
refinement classifier (MRC). Extensive experiments on three challenging
cross-font image retrieval datasets demonstrate that, given undeciphered OBI
characters, our CFIRN can effectively achieve accurate matches with characters
from other gallery fonts, thereby facilitating the deciphering.
