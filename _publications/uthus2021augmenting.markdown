We describe Verse by Verse, our experiment in augmenting the creative process
of writing poetry with an AI. We have created a group of AI poets, styled after
various American classic poets, that are able to offer as suggestions generated
lines of verse while a user is composing a poem. In this paper, we describe the
underlying system to offer these suggestions. This includes a generative model,
which is tasked with generating a large corpus of lines of verse offline and
which are then stored in an index, and a dual-encoder model that is tasked with
recommending the next possible set of verses from our index given the previous
line of verse.
