Aiming at recognizing the samples from novel categories with few reference
samples, few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging problem. We found that the
existing works often build their few-shot model based on the image-level
feature by mixing all local-level features, which leads to the discriminative
location bias and information loss in local details. To tackle the problem,
this paper returns the perspective to the local-level feature and proposes a
series of local-level strategies. Specifically, we present (a) a local-agnostic
training strategy to avoid the discriminative location bias between the base
and novel categories, (b) a novel local-level similarity measure to capture the
accurate comparison between local-level features, and (c) a local-level
knowledge transfer that can synthesize different knowledge transfers from the
base category according to different location features. Extensive experiments
justify that our proposed local-level strategies can significantly boost the
performance and achieve 2.8%-7.2% improvements over the baseline across
different benchmark datasets, which also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.
