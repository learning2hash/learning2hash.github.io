There is a large volume of late antique and medieval Hebrew texts. They
represent a crucial linguistic and cultural bridge between Biblical and modern
Hebrew. Poetry is prominent in these texts and one of its main haracteristics
is the frequent use of metaphor. Distinguishing figurative and literal language
use is a major task for scholars of the Humanities, especially in the fields of
literature, linguistics, and hermeneutics. This paper presents a new,
challenging dataset of late antique and medieval Hebrew poetry with expert
annotations of metaphor, as well as some baseline results, which we hope will
facilitate further research in this area.
