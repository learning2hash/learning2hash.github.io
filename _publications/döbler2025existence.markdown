We completely characterize the class of univariate distributions allowing for
a Stein kernel and illustrate our result by means of some concrete
distributions. Moreover, we apply our findings to prove a quantitative version
of the central limit theorem with optimal rate \(n^\{-1/2\}\) in total variation
distance for i.i.d. random variables whose distribution belongs to that class.
