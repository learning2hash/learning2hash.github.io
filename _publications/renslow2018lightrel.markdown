We present LightRel, a lightweight and fast relation classifier. Our goal is
to develop a high baseline for different relation extraction tasks. By defining
only very few data-internal, word-level features and external knowledge sources
in the form of word clusters and word embeddings, we train a fast and simple
linear classifier.
