MNIST and Fashion MNIST are extremely popular for testing in the machine
learning space. Fashion MNIST improves on MNIST by introducing a harder
problem, increasing the diversity of testing sets, and more accurately
representing a modern computer vision task. In order to increase the data
quality of FashionMNIST, this paper investigates near duplicate images between
training and testing sets. Near-duplicates between testing and training sets
artificially increase the testing accuracy of machine learning models. This
paper identifies near-duplicate images in Fashion MNIST and proposes a dataset
with near-duplicates removed.
