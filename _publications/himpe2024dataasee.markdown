Metadata management for distributed data sources is a long-standing but
ever-growing problem. To counter this challenge in a research-data and
library-oriented setting, this work constructs a data architecture, derived
from the data-lake: the metadata-lake. A proof-of-concept implementation of
this proposed metadata aggregator is presented and also evaluated.
