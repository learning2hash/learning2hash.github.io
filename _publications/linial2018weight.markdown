We investigate the weight distribution of random binary linear codes. For
\\(0<\lambda<1\\) and \\(n\to\infty\\) pick uniformly at random \\(\lambda n\\) vectors in
\\(\mathbb\{F\}_2^n\\) and let \\(C \le \mathbb\{F\}_2^n\\) be the orthogonal complement of
their span. Given \\(0<\gamma<1/2\\) with \\(0< \lambda < h(\gamma)\\) let \\(X\\) be the
random variable that counts the number of words in \\(C\\) of Hamming weight
\\(\gamma n\\). In this paper we determine the asymptotics of the moments of \\(X\\) of
all orders \\(o(\frac\{n\}\{log n\})\\).
