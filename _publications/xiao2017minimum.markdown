This paper presents a new decoding for polynomial residue codes, called the
minimum degree-weighted distance decoding. The newly proposed decoding is based
on the degree-weighted distance and different from the traditional minimum
Hamming distance decoding. It is shown that for the two types of minimum
distance decoders, i.e., the minimum degree-weighted distance decoding and the
minimum Hamming distance decoding, one is not absolutely stronger than the
other, but they can complement each other from different points of view.
