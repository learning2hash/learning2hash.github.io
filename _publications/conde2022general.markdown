The Google Universal Image Embedding (GUIE) Challenge is one of the first
competitions in multi-domain image representations in the wild, covering a wide
distribution of objects: landmarks, artwork, food, etc. This is a fundamental
computer vision problem with notable applications in image retrieval, search
engines and e-commerce. In this work, we explain our 4th place solution to the
GUIE Challenge, and our "bag of tricks" to fine-tune zero-shot Vision
Transformers (ViT) pre-trained using CLIP.
