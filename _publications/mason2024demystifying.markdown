The Local Moran's I statistic is a valuable tool for identifying localized
patterns of spatial autocorrelation. Understanding these patterns is crucial in
spatial analysis, but interpreting the statistic can be difficult. To simplify
this process, we introduce three novel visualizations that enhance the
interpretation of Local Moran's I results. These visualizations can be
interactively linked to one another, and to established visualizations, to
offer a more holistic exploration of the results. We provide a JavaScript
library with implementations of these new visual elements, along with a web
dashboard that demonstrates their integrated use.
