This paper presents the 6th place solution to the Google Universal Image
Embedding competition on Kaggle. Our approach is based on the CLIP
architecture, a powerful pre-trained model used to learn visual representation
from natural language supervision. We also utilized the SubCenter ArcFace loss
with dynamic margins to improve the distinctive power of class separability and
embeddings. Finally, a diverse dataset has been created based on the test's set
categories and the leaderboard's feedback. By carefully crafting a training
scheme to enhance transfer learning, our submission scored 0.685 on the private
leaderboard.
