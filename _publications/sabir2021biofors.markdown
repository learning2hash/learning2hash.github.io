Research in media forensics has gained traction to combat the spread of
misinformation. However, most of this research has been directed towards
content generated on social media. Biomedical image forensics is a related
problem, where manipulation or misuse of images reported in biomedical research
documents is of serious concern. The problem has failed to gain momentum beyond
an academic discussion due to an absence of benchmark datasets and standardized
tasks. In this paper we present BioFors -- the first dataset for benchmarking
common biomedical image manipulations. BioFors comprises 47,805 images
extracted from 1,031 open-source research papers. Images in BioFors are divided
into four categories -- Microscopy, Blot/Gel, FACS and Macroscopy. We also
propose three tasks for forensic analysis -- external duplication detection,
internal duplication detection and cut/sharp-transition detection. We benchmark
BioFors on all tasks with suitable state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results and
analysis show that existing algorithms developed on common computer vision
datasets are not robust when applied to biomedical images, validating that more
research is required to address the unique challenges of biomedical image
forensics.
