Cover song detection has been an active field in the Music Information
Retrieval (MIR) community during the past decades. Most of the research
community focused in solving it for a wide range of music genres with diverse
characteristics. Western classical music, a genre heavily based on the
recording of "cover songs", or musical works, represents a large heritage,
offering immediate application for an efficient fingerprint algorithm. We
propose an engineering approach for retrieving a cover song from a reference
database thanks to a fingerprint designed for classical musical works. We open
a new data set to encourage the scientific community to use it for further
researches regarding this genre.
