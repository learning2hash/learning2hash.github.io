Cover song detection has been an active field in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community during the past decades. Most of the research community focused in solving it for a wide range of music genres with diverse characteristics. Western classical music, a genre heavily based on the recording of "cover songs", or musical works, represents a large heritage, offering immediate application for an efficient fingerprint algorithm. We propose an engineering approach for retrieving a cover song from a reference database thanks to a fingerprint designed for classical musical works. We open a new data set to encourage the scientific community to use it for further researches regarding this genre.
