The MacWilliams' Extension Theorem is a classical result by Florence Jessie
MacWilliams. It shows that every linear isometry between linear block-codes
endowed with the Hamming distance can be extended to a linear isometry of the
ambient space. Such an extension fails to exist in general for rank-metric
codes, that is, one can easily find examples of linear isometries between
rank-metric codes which cannot be extended to linear isometries of the ambient
space. In this paper, we explore to what extent a MacWilliams' Extension
Theorem may hold for rank-metric codes. We provide an extensive list of
examples of obstructions to the existence of an extension, as well as a
positive result.
