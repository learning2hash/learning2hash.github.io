In this work, we present new state-of-the-art results of 93.59,% and 79.59,%
for Turkish and Czech named entity recognition based on the model of (Lample et
al., 2016). We contribute by proposing several schemes for representing the
morphological analysis of a word in the context of named entity recognition. We
show that a concatenation of this representation with the word and character
embeddings improves the performance. The effect of these representation schemes
on the tagging performance is also investigated.
