This letter introduces the LOOP binary descriptor (local optimal oriented
pattern) that encodes rotation invariance into the main formulation itself.
This makes any post processing stage for rotation invariance redundant and
improves on both accuracy and time complexity. We consider fine-grained
lepidoptera (moth/butterfly) species recognition as the representative problem
since it involves repetition of localized patterns and textures that may be
exploited for discrimination. We evaluate the performance of LOOP against its
predecessors as well as few other popular descriptors. Besides experiments on
standard benchmarks, we also introduce a new small image dataset on NZ
Lepidoptera. Loop performs as well or better on all datasets evaluated compared
to previous binary descriptors. The new dataset and demo code of the proposed
method are to be made available through the lead author's academic webpage and
GitHub.
