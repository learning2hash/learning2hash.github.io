Low rank representation (LRR) has recently attracted great interest due to
its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional sub- space structures
embedded in data. One of its successful applications is subspace clustering, by
which data are clustered according to the subspaces they belong to. In this
paper, at a higher level, we intend to cluster subspaces into classes of
subspaces. This is naturally described as a clustering problem on Grassmann
manifold. The novelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space
onto an LRR model on Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized LRR framework.
The new method has many applications in data analysis in computer vision tasks.
The proposed models have been evaluated on a number of practical data analysis
applications. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform
a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.
