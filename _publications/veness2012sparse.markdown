This short paper describes a simple coding technique, Sparse Sequential
Dirichlet Coding, for multi-alphabet memoryless sources. It is appropriate in
situations where only a small, unknown subset of the possible alphabet symbols
can be expected to occur in any particular data sequence. We provide a
competitive analysis which shows that the performance of Sparse Sequential
Dirichlet Coding will be close to that of a Sequential Dirichlet Coder that
knows in advance the exact subset of occurring alphabet symbols. Empirically we
show that our technique can perform similarly to the more computationally
demanding Sequential Sub-Alphabet Estimator, while using less computational
resources.
