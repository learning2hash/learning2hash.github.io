scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms and
utilities for use in research, education and industry applications. It is
released under the liberal "Modified BSD" open source license, provides a
well-documented API in the Python programming language, and is developed by an
active, international team of collaborators. In this paper we highlight the
advantages of open source to achieve the goals of the scikit-image library, and
we showcase several real-world image processing applications that use
scikit-image.
