This work addresses the task of multilabel image classification. Inspired by
the great success from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
single-label visual-semantic embedding, we exploit extending these models for
multilabel images. Specifically, we propose an image-dependent ranking model,
which returns a ranked list of labels according to its relevance to the input
image. In contrast to conventional CNN models that learn an image
representation (i.e. the image embedding vector), the developed model learns a
mapping (i.e. a transformation matrix) from an image in an attempt to
differentiate between its relevant and irrelevant labels. Despite the
conceptual simplicity of our approach, experimental results on a public
benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
performance while using fewer training images than other multilabel
classification methods.
