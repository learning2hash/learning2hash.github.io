A variety of computer vision applications depend on the efficiency of image
matching algorithms used. Various descriptors are designed to detect and match
features in images. Deployment of this algorithms in mobile applications
creates a need for low computation time. Binary descriptors requires less
computation time than float-point based descriptors because of the intensity
comparison between pairs of sample points and comparing after creating a binary
string. In order to decrease time complexity, quality of keypoints matched is
often compromised. We propose a keypoint descriptor named Morphological Retina
Keypoint Descriptor (MREAK) inspired by the function of human pupil which
dilates and constricts responding to the amount of light. By using
morphological operators of opening and closing and modifying the retinal
sampling pattern accordingly, an increase in the number of accurately matched
keypoints is observed. Our results show that matched keypoints are more
efficient than FREAK descriptor and requires low computation time than various
descriptors like SIFT, BRISK and SURF.
