Video understanding has received more attention in the past few years due to
the availability of several large-scale video datasets. However, annotating
large-scale video datasets are cost-intensive. In this work, we propose a
time-efficient video annotation method using spatio-temporal feature similarity
and t-SNE dimensionality reduction to speed up the annotation process
massively. Placing the same actions from different videos near each other in
the two-dimensional space based on feature similarity helps the annotator to
group-label video clips. We evaluate our method on two subsets of the
ActivityNet (v1.3) and a subset of the Sports-1M dataset. We show that t-EVA
can outperform other video annotation tools while maintaining test accuracy on
video classification.
