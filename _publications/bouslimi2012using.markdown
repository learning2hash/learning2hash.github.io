Medical images annotation is most of the time a repetitive hard task.
Collecting old similar annotations and assigning them to new medical images may
not only enhance the annotation process, but also reduce ambiguity caused by
repetitive annotations. The goal of this work is to propose an approach based
on Hausdorff distance able to compute similarity between a new medical image
and old stored images. User has to choose then one of the similar images and
annotations related to the selected one are assigned to the new one.
