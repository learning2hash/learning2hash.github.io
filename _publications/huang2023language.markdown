A big convergence of language multimodal perception action and world modeling is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. In this work we introduce Kosmos-1 a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can perceive general modalities learn in context (i.e. few-shot) and follow instructions (i.e. zero-shot). Specifically we train Kosmos-1 from scratch on web-scale multimodal corpora including arbitrarily interleaved text and images image-caption pairs and text data. We evaluate various settings including zero-shot few-shot and multimodal chain-of-thought prompting on a wide range of tasks without any gradient updates or finetuning. Experimental results show that Kosmos-1 achieves impressive performance on (i) language understanding generation and even OCR-free NLP (directly fed with document images) (ii) perception-language tasks including multimodal dialogue image captioning visual question answering and (iii) vision tasks such as image recognition with descriptions (specifying classification via text instructions). We also show that MLLMs can benefit from cross-modal transfer i.e. transfer knowledge from language to multimodal and from multimodal to language. In addition we introduce a dataset of Raven IQ test which diagnoses the nonverbal reasoning capability of MLLMs.
