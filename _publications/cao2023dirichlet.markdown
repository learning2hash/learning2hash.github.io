We prove the existence of a strongly local, regular, self-similar Dirichlet
form with a sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimate on an unconstrained Sierpinski
carpet in \(\mathbb\{R\}^3\). In the setting under consideration, the walk
dimension \(d_W\) and the Hausdorff dimension \(d_H\) always satisfy the inequality
that \(d_H>d_W\).
