This paper gives an overview of our current Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
research. We recently released the OMR dataset *DeepScores* as well as the
object detection method *Deep Watershed Detector*. We are currently taking
some additional steps to improve both of them. Here we summarize current and
future efforts, aimed at improving usefulness on real-world task and tackling
extreme class imbalance.
