Recommender systems are a class of machine learning algorithms that provide
relevant recommendations to a user based on the user's interaction with similar
items or based on the content of the item. In settings where the content of the
item is to be preserved, a content-based approach would be beneficial. This
paper aims to highlight the advantages of the content-based approach through
learned embeddings and leveraging these advantages to provide better and
personalised movie recommendations based on user preferences to various movie
features such as genre and keyword tags.
