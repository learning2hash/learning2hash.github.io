Research in sociology and linguistics shows that people use language not only
to express their own identity but to understand the identity of others. Recent
work established a connection between expression of identity and emoji usage on
social media, through use of emoji skin tone modifiers. Motivated by that
finding, this work asks if, as with language, readers are sensitive to such
acts of self-expression and use them to understand the identity of authors. In
behavioral experiments (n=488), where text and emoji content of social media
posts were carefully controlled before being presented to participants, we find
in the affirmative -- emoji are a salient signal of author identity. That
signal is distinct from, and complementary to, the one encoded in language.
Participant groups (based on self-identified ethnicity) showed no differences
in how they perceive this signal, except in the case of the default yellow
emoji. While both groups associate this with a White identity, the effect was
stronger in White participants. Our finding that emoji can index social
variables will have experimental applications for researchers but also
implications for designers: supposedly ``neutral`` defaults may be more
representative of some users than others.
