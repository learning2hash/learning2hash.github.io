We introduce the Evidential Transformer, an uncertainty-driven transformer
model for improved and robust image retrieval. In this paper, we make several
contributions to content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We incorporate
probabilistic methods into image retrieval, achieving robust and reliable
results, with evidential classification surpassing traditional training based
on multiclass classification as a baseline for deep metric learning.
Furthermore, we improve the state-of-the-art retrieval results on several
datasets by leveraging the Global Context Vision Transformer (GC ViT)
architecture. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the reliability
of our approach, setting a new benchmark in CBIR in all test settings on the
Stanford Online Products (SOP) and CUB-200-2011 datasets.
