A pun is a form of wordplay for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect,
where a word suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy (homographic
pun) or phonological similarity to another word (heterographic pun). This paper
presents an approach that addresses pun detection and pun location jointly from
a sequence labeling perspective. We employ a new tagging scheme such that the
model is capable of performing such a joint task, where useful structural
information can be properly captured. We show that our proposed model is
effective in handling both homographic and heterographic puns. Empirical
results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve new
state-of-the-art results.
