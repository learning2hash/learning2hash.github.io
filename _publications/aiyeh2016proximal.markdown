The focus of this article is on the detection and classification of patterns
based on groupoids. The approach hinges on descriptive proximity of points in a
set based on the neighborliness property. This approach lends support to image
analysis and understanding and in studying nearness of image segments. A
practical application of the approach is in terms of the analysis of natural
images for pattern identification and classification.
