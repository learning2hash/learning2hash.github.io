This paper presents the release of EmojiNet, the largest machine-readable
emoji sense inventory that links Unicode emoji representations to their English
meanings extracted from the Web. EmojiNet is a dataset consisting of: (i)
12,904 sense labels over 2,389 emoji, which were extracted from the web and
linked to machine-readable sense definitions seen in BabelNet, (ii) context
words associated with each emoji sense, which are inferred through word
embedding models trained over Google News corpus and a Twitter message corpus
for each emoji sense definition, and (iii) recognizing discrepancies in the
presentation of emoji on different platforms, specification of the most likely
platform-based emoji sense for a selected set of emoji. The dataset is hosted
as an open service with a REST API and is available at
http://emojinet.knoesis.org/. The development of this dataset, evaluation of
its quality, and its applications including emoji sense disambiguation and
emoji sense similarity are discussed.
