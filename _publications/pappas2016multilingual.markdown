The impact of culture in visual emotion perception has recently captured the
attention of multimedia research. In this study, we pro- vide powerful
computational linguistics tools to explore, retrieve and browse a dataset of
16K multilingual affective visual concepts and 7.3M Flickr images. First, we
design an effective crowdsourc- ing experiment to collect human judgements of
sentiment connected to the visual concepts. We then use word embeddings to
repre- sent these concepts in a low dimensional vector space, allowing us to
expand the meaning around concepts, and thus enabling insight about
commonalities and differences among different languages. We compare a variety
of concept representations through a novel evaluation task based on the notion
of visual semantic relatedness. Based on these representations, we design
clustering schemes to group multilingual visual concepts, and evaluate them
with novel metrics based on the crowdsourced sentiment annotations as well as
visual semantic relatedness. The proposed clustering framework enables us to
analyze the full multilingual dataset in-depth and also show an application on
a facial data subset, exploring cultural in- sights of portrait-related
affective visual concepts.
