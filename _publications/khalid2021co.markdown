Urdu is a widely spoken language in South Asia. Though immoderate literature
exists for the Urdu language still the data isn't enough to naturally process
the language by NLP techniques. Very efficient language models exist for the
English language, a high resource language, but Urdu and other under-resourced
languages have been neglected for a long time. To create efficient language
models for these languages we must have good word embedding models. For Urdu,
we can only find word embeddings trained and developed using the skip-gram
model. In this paper, we have built a corpus for Urdu by scraping and
integrating data from various sources and compiled a vocabulary for the Urdu
language. We also modify fasttext embeddings and N-Grams models to enable
training them on our built corpus. We have used these trained embeddings for a
word similarity task and compared the results with existing techniques.
