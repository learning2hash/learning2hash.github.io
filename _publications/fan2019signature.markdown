In this paper, we study the signature codes for weighted binary adder channel
(WbAC) and collusion-resistant multimedia fingerprinting. Let \\(A(n,t)\\) denote
the maximum cardinality of a \\(t\\)-signature code of length \\(n\\), and \\(A(n,w,t)\\)
denote the maximum cardinality of a \\(t\\)-signature code of length \\(n\\) and
constant weight \\(w\\). First, we derive asymptotic and general upper bounds of
\\(A(n,t)\\) by relating signature codes to \\(B_t\\) codes and bipartite graphs with
large girth respectively, and also show the upper bounds are tight for certain
cases. Second, we determine the exact values of \\(A(n,2,2)\\) and \\(A(n,3,2)\\) for
infinitely many \\(n\\) by connecting signature codes with \\(C_4\\)-free graphs and
union-free families, respectively. Third, we provide two explicit constructions
for \\(t\\)-signature codes which have efficient decoding algorithms and
applications to two-level signature codes. Furthermore, we show from the
geometric viewpoint that there does not exist any binary code with complete
traceability for noisy WbAC and multimedia fingerprinting. A new type of
signature codes with a weaker requirement than complete traceability is
introduced for the noisy scenario.
