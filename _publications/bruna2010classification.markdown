A scattering vector is a local descriptor including multiscale and
multi-direction co-occurrence information. It is computed with a cascade of
wavelet decompositions and complex modulus. This scattering representation is
locally translation invariant and linearizes deformations. A supervised
classification algorithm is computed with a PCA model selection on scattering
vectors. State of the art results are obtained for handwritten digit
recognition and texture classification.
