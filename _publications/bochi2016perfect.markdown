In this note we study inhomogeneous random bipartite graphs in random
environment. These graphs can be thought of as an extension of the classical
Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs in a random environment. We show that the
expected number of perfect matchings obeys a precise quenched asymptotic and
that it can be approximated using an iterative process that converges
exponentially fast.
