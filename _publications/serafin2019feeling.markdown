We provide short-time asymptotics with rates of convergence for the Laplace
Dirichlet heat kernel in a ball. The boundary behaviour is precisely described.
Presented results may be considered as a complement or a generalization of the
famous "principle of not feeling the boundary" in case of a ball.
