<p>The binary Hamming codes with parameters <span
class="math inline">\([2^m-1, 2^m-1-m, 3]\)</span> are perfect. Their
extended codes have parameters <span class="math inline">\([2^m,
2^m-1-m, 4]\)</span> and are distance-optimal. The first objective of
this paper is to construct a class of binary linear codes with
parameters <span
class="math inline">\([2^{m+s}+2^s-2^m,2^{m+s}+2^s-2^m-2m-2,4]\)</span>,
which have better information rates than the class of extended binary
Hamming codes, and are also distance-optimal. The second objective is to
construct a class of distance-optimal binary codes with parameters <span
class="math inline">\([2^m+2, 2^m-2m, 6]\)</span>. Both classes of
binary linear codes have new parameters.</p>
