The binary Hamming codes with parameters \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\([2^m-1, 2^m-1-m, 3]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} are perfect. Their extended codes have parameters \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\([2^m, 2^m-1-m, 4]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and are distance-optimal. The first objective of this paper is to construct a class of binary linear codes with parameters \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\([2^\{m+s\}+2^s-2^m,2^\{m+s\}+2^s-2^m-2m-2,4]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, which have better information rates than the class of extended binary Hamming codes, and are also distance-optimal. The second objective is to construct a class of distance-optimal binary codes with parameters \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\([2^m+2, 2^m-2m, 6]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Both classes of binary linear codes have new parameters.
