The binary Hamming codes with parameters \\([2^m-1, 2^m-1-m, 3]\\) are perfect. Their extended codes have parameters \\([2^m, 2^m-1-m, 4]\\) and are distance-optimal. The first objective of this paper is to construct a class of binary linear codes with parameters \\([2^\{m+s\}+2^s-2^m,2^\{m+s\}+2^s-2^m-2m-2,4]\\), which have better information rates than the class of extended binary Hamming codes, and are also distance-optimal. The second objective is to construct a class of distance-optimal binary codes with parameters \\([2^m+2, 2^m-2m, 6]\\). Both classes of binary linear codes have new parameters.
