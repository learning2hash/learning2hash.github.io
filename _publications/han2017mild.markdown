Loop Closure Detection (LCD) has been proved to be extremely useful in global consistent visual Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and appearance-based robot relocalization. Methods exploiting binary features in bag of words representation have recently gained a lot of popularity for their efficiency, but suffer from low recall due to the inherent drawback that high dimensional binary feature descriptors lack well-defined centroids. In this paper, we propose a realtime LCD approach called MILD (Multi-Index Hashing for Loop closure Detection), in which image similarity is measured by feature matching directly to achieve high recall without introducing extra computational complexity with the aid of Multi-Index Hashing (MIH). A theoretical analysis of the approximate image similarity measurement using MIH is presented, which reveals the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy from a probabilistic perspective. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art LCD methods demonstrate the superiority of MILD in both efficiency and accuracy.
