Loop Closure Detection (LCD) has been proved to be extremely useful in global
consistent visual Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and
appearance-based robot relocalization. Methods exploiting binary features in
bag of words representation have recently gained a lot of popularity for their
efficiency, but suffer from low recall due to the inherent drawback that high
dimensional binary feature descriptors lack well-defined centroids. In this
paper, we propose a realtime LCD approach called MILD (Multi-Index Hashing for
Loop closure Detection), in which image similarity is measured by feature
matching directly to achieve high recall without introducing extra
computational complexity with the aid of Multi-Index Hashing (MIH). A
theoretical analysis of the approximate image similarity measurement using MIH
is presented, which reveals the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy from
a probabilistic perspective. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art LCD
methods demonstrate the superiority of MILD in both efficiency and accuracy.
