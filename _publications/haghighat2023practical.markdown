Noisy shuffling channels capture the main characteristics of DNA storage
systems where distinct segments of data are received out of order, after being
corrupted by substitution errors. For realistic schemes with short-length
segments, practical indexing and channel coding strategies are required to
restore the order and combat the channel noise. In this paper, we develop a
finite-length concatenated coding scheme that employs Reed-Solomon (RS) codes
as outer codes and polar codes as inner codes, and utilizes an implicit
indexing method based on cosets of the polar code. We propose a matched
decoding method along with a metric for detecting the index that successfully
restores the order, and correct channel errors at the receiver. Residual errors
that are not corrected by the matched decoder are then corrected by the outer
RS code. We derive analytical approximations for the frame error rate of the
proposed scheme, and also evaluate its performance through simulations to
demonstrate that the proposed implicit indexing method outperforms explicit
indexing.
