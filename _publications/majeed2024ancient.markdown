Many languages have vast amounts of handwritten texts, such as ancient
scripts about folktale stories and historical narratives or contemporary
documents and letters. Digitization of those texts has various applications,
such as daily tasks, cultural studies, and historical research. Syriac is an
ancient, endangered, and low-resourced language that has not received the
attention it requires and deserves. This paper reports on a research project
aimed at developing a optical character recognition (OCR) model based on the
handwritten Syriac texts as a starting point to build more digital services for
this endangered language. A dataset was created, KHAMIS (inspired by the East
Syriac poet, Khamis bar Qardahe), which consists of handwritten sentences in
the East Syriac script. We used it to fine-tune the Tesseract-OCR engine's
pretrained Syriac model on handwritten data. The data was collected from
volunteers capable of reading and writing in the language to create KHAMIS.
KHAMIS currently consists of 624 handwritten Syriac sentences collected from 31
university students and one professor, and it will be partially available
online and the whole dataset available in the near future for development and
research purposes. As a result, the handwritten OCR model was able to achieve a
character error rate of 1.097-1.610% and 8.963-10.490% on both training and
evaluation sets, respectively, and both a character error rate of 18.89-19.71%
and a word error rate of 62.83-65.42% when evaluated on the test set, which is
twice as better than the default Syriac model of Tesseract.
