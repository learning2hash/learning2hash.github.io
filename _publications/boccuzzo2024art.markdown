Art authentication has historically established itself as a task requiring
profound connoisseurship of one particular artist. Nevertheless, famous art
forgers such as Wolfgang Beltracchi were able to deceive dozens of art experts.
In recent years Artificial Intelligence algorithms have been successfully
applied to various image processing tasks. In this work, we leverage the
growing improvements in AI to present an art authentication framework for the
identification of the forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. Differently from existing
literature on AI-aided art authentication, we focus on a specialized model of a
forger, rather than an artist, flipping the approach of traditional AI methods.
We use a carefully compiled dataset of known artists forged by Beltracchi and a
set of known works by the forger to train a multiclass image classification
model based on EfficientNet. We compare the results with Kolmogorov Arnold
Networks (KAN) which, to the best of our knowledge, have never been tested in
the art domain. The results show a general agreement between the different
models' predictions on artworks flagged as forgeries, which are then closely
studied using visual analysis.
