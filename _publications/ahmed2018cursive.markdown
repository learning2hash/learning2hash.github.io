The camera captured images have various aspects to investigate. Generally,
the emphasis of research depends on the interesting regions. Sometimes the
focus could be on color segmentation, object detection or scene text analysis.
The image analysis, visibility and layout analysis are the tasks easier for
humans as suggested by behavioral trait of humans, but in contrast when these
same tasks are supposed to perform by machines then it seems to be challenging.
The learning machines always learn from the properties associated to provided
samples. The numerous approaches are designed in recent years for scene text
extraction and recognition and the efforts are underway to improve the
accuracy. The convolutional approach provided reasonable results on non-cursive
text analysis appeared in natural images. The work presented in this manuscript
exploited the strength of linear pyramids by considering each pyramid as a
feature of the provided sample. Each pyramid image process through various
empirically selected kernels. The performance was investigated by considering
Arabic text on each image pyramid of EASTR-42k dataset. The error rate of 0.17%
was reported on Arabic scene text recognition.
