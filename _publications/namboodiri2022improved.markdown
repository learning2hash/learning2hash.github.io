The multi-access variant of the coded caching problem with \(N\) files, \(K\)
users and \(K\) caches, where each user has access to \(L\) neighbouring caches in
a cyclic wrap-around manner, is considered. A cut-set based lower bound on the
optimal rate-memory trade-off of the multi-access coded caching (MACC) scheme
is derived. Furthermore, an improved lower bound on the optimal rate-memory
trade-off of the MACC scheme is derived using non-cut-set arguments. The
improved lower bound is tighter than the previously known lower bounds for the
same setting.
