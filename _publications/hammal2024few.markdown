Named-entity recognition (NER) is a task that typically requires large
annotated datasets, which limits its applicability across domains with varying
entity definitions. This paper addresses few-shot NER, aiming to transfer
knowledge to new domains with minimal supervision. Unlike previous approaches
that rely solely on limited annotated data, we propose a weakly supervised
algorithm that combines small labeled datasets with large amounts of unlabeled
data. Our method extends the k-means algorithm with label supervision, cluster
size constraints and domain-specific discriminative subspace selection. This
unified framework achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot NER on several
English datasets.
