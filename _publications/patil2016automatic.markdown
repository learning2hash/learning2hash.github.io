Non-photorealistic rendering techniques work on image features and often
manipulate a set of characteristics such as edges and texture to achieve a
desired depiction of the scene. Most computational photography methods
decompose an image using edge preserving filters and work on the resulting base
and detail layers independently to achieve desired visual effects. We propose a
new approach for content-aware non-photorealistic rendering of images where we
manipulate the visually salient and the non-salient regions separately. We
propose a novel content-aware framework in order to render an image for
applications such as detail exaggeration, artificial blurring and image
abstraction. The processed regions of the image are blended seamlessly for all
these applications. We demonstrate that content awareness of the proposed
method leads to automatic generation of non-photorealistic rendering of the
same image for the different applications mentioned above.
