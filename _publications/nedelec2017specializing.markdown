We propose a unified product embedded representation that is optimized for
the task of retrieval-based product recommendation. To this end, we introduce a
new way to fuse modality-specific product embeddings into a joint product
embedding, in order to leverage both product content information, such as
textual descriptions and images, and product collaborative filtering signal. By
introducing the fusion step at the very end of our architecture, we are able to
train each modality separately, allowing us to keep a modular architecture that
is preferable in real-world recommendation deployments. We analyze our
performance on normal and hard recommendation setups such as cold-start and
cross-category recommendations and achieve good performance on a large product
shopping dataset.
