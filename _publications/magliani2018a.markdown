The recent advances brought by deep learning allowed to improve the performance
in image retrieval tasks. Through the many convolutional layers, available in a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it is possible to obtain a hierarchy of
features from the evaluated image. At every step, the patches extracted are
smaller than the previous levels and more representative. Following this idea,
this paper introduces a new detector applied on the feature maps extracted from
pre-trained CNN. Specifically, this approach lets to increase the number of
features in order to increase the performance of the aggregation algorithms like
the most famous and used VLAD embedding. The proposed approach is tested on
different public datasets: Holidays, Oxford5k, Paris6k and UKB.
