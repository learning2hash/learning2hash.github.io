Traditional clustering algorithms often focus on the most fine-grained
information and achieve clustering by calculating the distance between each
pair of data points or implementing other calculations based on points. This
way is not inconsistent with the cognitive mechanism of "global precedence" in
human brain, resulting in those methods' bad performance in efficiency,
generalization ability and robustness. To address this problem, we propose a
new clustering algorithm called granular-ball clustering (GBCT) via
granular-ball computing. Firstly, GBCT generates a smaller number of
granular-balls to represent the original data, and forms clusters according to
the relationship between granular-balls, instead of the traditional point
relationship. At the same time, its coarse-grained characteristics are not
susceptible to noise, and the algorithm is efficient and robust; besides, as
granular-balls can fit various complex data, GBCT performs much better in
non-spherical data sets than other traditional clustering methods. The
completely new coarse granularity representation method of GBCT and cluster
formation mode can also used to improve other traditional methods.
