The idea of representations of the data in negatively curved manifolds
recently attracted a lot of attention and gave a rise to the new research
direction named \{\it hyperbolic machine learning\} (ML). In order to unveil the
full potential of this new paradigm, efficient techniques for data analysis and
statistical modeling in hyperbolic spaces are necessary. In the present paper
rigorous mathematical framework for clustering in hyperbolic spaces is
established. First, we introduce the \(k\)-means clustering in hyperbolic balls,
based on the novel definition of barycenter. Second, we present the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning mixtures of novel
probability distributions in hyperbolic balls. In such a way we lay the
foundation of unsupervised learning in hyperbolic spaces.
