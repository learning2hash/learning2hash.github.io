Tables are an extremely powerful visual and interactive tool for structuring
and manipulating data, making spreadsheet programs one of the most popular
computer applications. In this paper we introduce and address the task of
recommending related tables: given an input table, identifying and returning a
ranked list of relevant tables. One of the many possible application scenarios
for this task is to provide users of a spreadsheet program proactively with
recommendations for related structured content on the Web. At its core, the
related table recommendation task boils down to computing the similarity
between a pair of tables. We develop a theoretically sound framework for
performing table matching. Our approach hinges on the idea of representing
table elements in multiple semantic spaces, and then combining element-level
similarities using a discriminative learning model. Using a purpose-built test
collection from Wikipedia tables, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
delivers state-of-the-art performance.
