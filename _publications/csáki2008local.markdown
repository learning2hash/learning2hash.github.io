We study some properties of the local time of the asymmetric Bernoulli walk
on the line. These properties are very similar to the corresponding ones of the
simple symmetric random walks in higher (\(d\geq3\)) dimension, which we
established in the recent years. The goal of this paper is to highlight these
similarities.
