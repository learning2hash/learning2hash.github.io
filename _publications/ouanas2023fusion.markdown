Kinship verification from face images is a novel and formidable challenge in
the realms of pattern recognition and computer vision. This work makes notable
contributions by incorporating a preprocessing technique known as Multiscale
Retinex (MSR), which enhances image quality. Our approach harnesses the
strength of complementary deep (VGG16) and shallow texture descriptors (BSIF)
by combining them at the score level using Logistic Regression (LR) technique.
We assess the effectiveness of our approach by conducting comprehensive
experiments on three challenging kinship datasets: Cornell Kin Face, UB Kin
Face and TS Kin Face
