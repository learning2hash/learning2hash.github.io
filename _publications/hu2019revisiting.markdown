Shadow detection in general photos is a nontrivial problem, due to the
complexity of the real world. Though recent shadow detectors have already
achieved remarkable performance on various benchmark data, their performance is
still limited for general real-world situations. In this work, we collected
shadow images for multiple scenarios and compiled a new dataset of 10,500
shadow images, each with labeled ground-truth mask, for supporting shadow
detection in the complex world. Our dataset covers a rich variety of scene
categories, with diverse shadow sizes, locations, contrasts, and types.
Further, we comprehensively analyze the complexity of the dataset, present a
fast shadow detection network with a detail enhancement module to harvest
shadow details, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to detect
shadows in general situations.
