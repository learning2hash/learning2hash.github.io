In a recent work, Bombin, Duclos-Cianci, and Poulin showed that every local
translationally invariant 2D topological stabilizer code is locally equivalent
to a finite number of copies of Kitaev's toric code. For 2D color codes,
Delfosse relaxed the constraint on translation invariance and mapped a 2D color
code onto three surface codes. In this paper, we propose an alternate map based
on linear algebra. We show that any 2D color code can be mapped onto exactly
two copies of a related surface code. The surface code in our map is induced by
the color code and easily derived from the color code. Furthermore, our map
does not require any ancilla qubits for the surface codes.
