To simplify the parameter of the deep learning network a cascaded compressive sensing model CSNet is implemented for image classification. Firstly we use cascaded compressive sensing network to learn feature from the data. Secondly CSNet generates the feature by binary hashing and block-wise histograms. Finally a linear SVM classifier is used to classify these features. The experiments on the MNIST dataset indicate that higher classification accuracy can be obtained by this algorithm.
