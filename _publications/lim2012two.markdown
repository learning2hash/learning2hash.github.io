There is recent interest in compressing data sets for non-sequential
settings, where lack of obvious orderings on their data space, require notions
of data equivalences to be considered. For example, Varshney & Goyal (DCC,
2006) considered multiset equivalences, while Choi & Szpankowski (IEEE Trans.
IT, 2012) considered isomorphic equivalences in graphs. Here equivalences are
considered under a relatively broad framework - finite-dimensional,
non-sequential data spaces with equivalences under group action, for which
analogues of two well-studied embedding theorems are derived: the Whitney
embedding theorem and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Only the canonical data
points need to be carefully embedded, each such point representing a set of
data points equivalent under group action. Two-step embeddings are considered.
First, a group invariant is applied to account for equivalences, and then
secondly, a linear embedding takes it down to low-dimensions. Our results
require hypotheses on discriminability of the applied invariant, such notions
related to seperating invariants (Dufresne, 2008), and completeness in pattern
recognition (Kakarala, 1992). In the latter theorem, the embedding complexity
depends on the size of the canonical part, which may be significantly smaller
than the whole data set, up to a factor equal to the size the group.
