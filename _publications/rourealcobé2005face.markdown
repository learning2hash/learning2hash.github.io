This paper presents experimental results using the ORL (40 people) and FERET
(994 people) databases. The ORL database can be useful for securing
applications where few users attempting to access are expected. This is the
case, for instance, of a PDA or PC where the password is the face of the user.
On the other hand, the FERET database is useful for studying those situations
where the number of authorized users is around a thousand people.
