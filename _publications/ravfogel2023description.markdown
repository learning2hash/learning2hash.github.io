<p>Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many
information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings
appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in
current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and
sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of
similarity for effective retrieval of text? We identify the need to
search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and
the corresponding notion of . We demonstrate the inadequacy of current
text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly
improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is
trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a
LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new
capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.</p>
