Copy detection, which is a task to determine whether an image is a modified copy
of any image in a database, is an unsolved problem. Thus, we addressed copy
detection by training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with contrastive
learning. Training with a large memory-bank and hard data augmentation enables
the CNNs to obtain more discriminative representation. Our proposed negative
embedding subtraction further boosts the copy detection accuracy. Using our
methods, we achieved 1st place in the Facebook AI Image Similarity Challenge:
Descriptor Track. Our code is publicly available here:
