Copy detection, which is a task to determine whether an image is a modified
copy of any image in a database, is an unsolved problem. Thus, we addressed
copy detection by training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with
contrastive learning. Training with a large memory-bank and hard data
augmentation enables the CNNs to obtain more discriminative representation. Our
proposed negative embedding subtraction further boosts the copy detection
accuracy. Using our methods, we achieved 1st place in the Facebook AI Image
Similarity Challenge: Descriptor Track. Our code is publicly available here:
