In this paper we analyze hashing from a worst-case perspective. To this end we study a new property of hash families that is strongly related to d-perfect hashing namely c-ideality. On the one hand this notion generalizes the definition of perfect hashing which has been studied extensively; on the other hand it provides a direct link to the notion of c-approximativity. We focus on the usually neglected case where the average load \alpha is at least 1 and prove upper and lower parametrized bounds on the minimal size of c-ideal hash families. As an aside we show how c-ideality helps to analyze the advice complexity of hashing. The concept of advice introduced a decade ago lets us measure the information content of an online problem. We prove hashings advice complexity to be linear in the hash table size.
