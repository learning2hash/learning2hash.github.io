We describe a new class of subsampling techniques for CNNs, termed
multisampling, that significantly increases the amount of information kept by
feature maps through subsampling layers. One version of our method, which we
call checkered subsampling, significantly improves the accuracy of
state-of-the-art architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet without any
additional parameters and, remarkably, improves the accuracy of certain
pretrained ImageNet models without any training or fine-tuning. We glean
possible insight into the nature of data augmentations and demonstrate
experimentally that coarse feature maps are bottlenecking the performance of
neural networks in image classification.
