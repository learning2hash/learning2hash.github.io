Current large open vision models could be useful for one and few-shot object
recognition. Nevertheless, gradient-based re-training solutions are costly. On
the other hand, open-vocabulary object detection models bring closer visual and
textual concepts in the same latent space, allowing zero-shot detection via
prompting at small computational cost. We propose a lightweight method to turn
the latter into a one-shot or few-shot object recognition models without
requiring textual descriptions. Our experiments on the TEgO dataset using the
YOLO-World model as a base show that performance increases with the model size,
the number of examples and the use of image augmentation.
