<p>Given a data stream <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A} = \langle
a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m \rangle\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> elements where each <span
class="math inline">\(a_i \in [n]\)</span>, the Distinct Elements
problem is to estimate the number of distinct elements in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.Distinct Elements has been a
subject of theoretical and empirical investigations over the past four
decades resulting in space optimal algorithms for it.All the current
state-of-the-art algorithms are, however, beyond the reach of an
undergraduate textbook owing to their reliance on the usage of notions
such as pairwise independence and universal hash functions. We present a
simple, intuitive, sampling-based space-efficient algorithm whose
description and the proof are accessible to undergraduates with the
knowledge of basic probability theory.</p>
