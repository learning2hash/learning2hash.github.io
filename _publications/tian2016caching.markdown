We propose a new caching scheme where linear combinations of the file
segments are cached at the users, for the cases where the number of files is no
greater than the number of users. When a user requests a certain file in the
delivery phase, the other file segments in the cached linear combinations can
be viewed as interferences. The proposed scheme combines rank metric codes and
maximum distance separable codes to facilitate the decoding and elimination of
these interferences, and also to simultaneously deliver useful contents to the
intended users. The performance of the proposed scheme can be explicitly
evaluated, and we show that the tradeoff points achieved by this scheme can
strictly improve known tradeoff inner bounds in the literature; for certain
special cases, the new tradeoff points can be shown to be optimal.
