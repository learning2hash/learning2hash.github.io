Zero-shot image classification using auxiliary information, such as
attributes describing discriminative object properties, requires time-consuming
annotation by domain experts. We instead propose a method that relies on human
gaze as auxiliary information, exploiting that even non-expert users have a
natural ability to judge class membership. We present a data collection
paradigm that involves a discrimination task to increase the information
content obtained from gaze data. Our method extracts discriminative descriptors
from the data and learns a compatibility function between image and gaze using
three novel gaze embeddings: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid
(GFG) and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS). We introduce two new
gaze-annotated datasets for fine-grained image classification and show that
human gaze data is indeed class discriminative, provides a competitive
alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and outperforms other baselines for
zero-shot image classification.
