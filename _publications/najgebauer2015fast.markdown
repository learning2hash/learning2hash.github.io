This paper describes a method for searching for common sets of descriptors between collections of images. The presented method operates on local interest keypoints which are generated using the SURF algorithm. The use of a dictionary of descriptors allowed achieving good performance of the content-based image retrieval. The method can be used to initially determine a set of similar pairs of keypoints between images. For this purpose we use a certain level of tolerance between values of descriptors as values of feature descriptors are almost never equal but similar between different images. After that the method compares the structure of rotation and location of interest points in one image with the point structure in other images. Thus we were able to find similar areas in images and determine the level of similarity between them even when images contain different scenes.
