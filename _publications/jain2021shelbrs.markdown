Location-Based Recommendation Services (LBRS) has seen an unprecedented rise
in its usage in recent years. LBRS facilitates a user by recommending services
based on his location and past preferences. However, leveraging such services
comes at a cost of compromising one's sensitive information like their shopping
preferences, lodging places, food habits, recently visited places, etc. to the
third-party servers. Losing such information could be crucial and threatens
one's privacy. Nowadays, the privacy-aware society seeks solutions that can
provide such services, with minimized risks. Recently, a few privacy-preserving
recommendation services have been proposed that exploit the fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) properties to address the issue. Though, it reduced privacy
risks but suffered from heavy computational overheads that ruled out their
commercial applications. Here, we propose SHELBRS, a lightweight LBRS that is
based on switchable homomorphic encryption (SHE), which will benefit the users
as well as the service providers. A SHE exploits both the additive as well as
the multiplicative homomorphic properties but with comparatively much lesser
processing time as it's FHE counterpart. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed scheme with the other state-of-the-art approaches without compromising
security.
