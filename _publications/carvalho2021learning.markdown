Generating static novel views from an already captured image is a hard task
in computer vision and graphics, in particular when the single input image has
dynamic parts such as persons or moving objects. In this paper, we tackle this
problem by proposing a new framework, called CycleMPI, that is capable of
learning a multiplane image representation from single images through a cyclic
training strategy for self-supervision. Our framework does not require stereo
data for training, therefore it can be trained with massive visual data from
the Internet, resulting in a better generalization capability even for very
challenging cases. Although our method does not require stereo data for
supervision, it reaches results on stereo datasets comparable to the state of
the art in a zero-shot scenario. We evaluated our method on RealEstate10K and
Mannequin Challenge datasets for view synthesis and presented qualitative
results on Places II dataset.
