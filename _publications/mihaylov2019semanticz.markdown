We describe our system for finding good answers in a community forum, as
defined in SemEval-2016, Task 3 on Community Question Answering. Our approach
relies on several semantic similarity features based on fine-tuned word
embeddings and topics similarities. In the main Subtask C, our primary
submission was ranked third, with a MAP of 51.68 and accuracy of 69.94. In
Subtask A, our primary submission was also third, with MAP of 77.58 and
accuracy of 73.39.
