Over the past decade, learning a dictionary from input images for sparse
modeling has been one of the topics which receive most research attention in
image processing and compressed sensing. Most existing dictionary learning
methods consider an over-complete dictionary, such as the K-SVD method, which
may result in high mutual incoherence and therefore has a negative impact in
recognition. On the other side, the sparse codes are usually optimized by
adding the \(\ell_0\) or \(\ell_1\)-norm penalty, but with no strict sparsity
guarantee. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal dictionary learning model
which can obtain strictly sparse codes and orthogonal dictionary with global
sequence convergence guarantee. We find that our method can result in better
denoising results than over-complete dictionary based learning methods, and has
the additional advantage of high computation efficiency.
