The popularity of deep learning is increasing by the day. However, despite
the recent advancements in hardware, deep neural networks remain
computationally intensive. Recent work has shown that by preserving the angular
distance between vectors, random feature maps are able to reduce dimensionality
without introducing bias to the estimator. We test a variety of established
hashing pipelines as well as a new approach using Kac's random walk matrices.
We demonstrate that this method achieves similar accuracy to existing
pipelines.
