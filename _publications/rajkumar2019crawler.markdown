Due to the advancement in computer communication and storage technologies,
large amount of image data is available on World Wide Web (WWW). In order to
locate a particular set of images the available search engines may be used with
the help of keywords. Here, the filtering of unwanted data is not done. For the
purpose of retrieving relevant images with appropriate keyword(s) an image
crawler is designed and implemented. Here, keyword(s) are submitted as query
and with the help of sender engine, images are downloaded along with metadata
like URL, filename, file size, file access date and time etc.,. Later, with the
help of URL, images already present in repository and newly downloaded are
compared for uniqueness. Only unique URLs are in turn considered and stored in
repository. The images in the repository are used to build novel Content Based
Image Retrieval (CBIR) system in future. This repository may be used for
various purposes. This image crawler tool is useful in building image datasets
which can be used by any CBIR system for training and testing purposes.
