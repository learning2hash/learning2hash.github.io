Concentration bounds are given for throwing balls into bins independently
according to a distribution \(p\). The probability of a \(k\)-loaded bin after \(m\)
balls is shown to be controlled on both sides by \(\rho_\{m,k\} := m \|p\|_k / k\).
This gives concentration inequalities for the maximum load as well as for the
waiting time until a \(k\)-loaded bin.
