We show an optimal data45;dependent hashing scheme for the approximate near neighbor problem. For an n45;point data set in a d45;dimensional space our data structure achieves query time O(d n^123;ρ+o(1)125;) and space O(n^123;1+ρ+o(1)125; + dn) where ρ=tfrac123;1125;123;2c^245;1125; for the Euclidean space and approximation c1. For the Hamming space we obtain an exponent of ρ=tfrac123;1125;123;2c45;1125;. Our result completes the direction set forth in AINR14 who gave a proof45;of45;concept that data45;dependent hashing can outperform classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In contrast to AINR14 the new bound is not only optimal but in fact improves over the best (optimal) LSH data structures IM98AI06 for all approximation factors c1. From the technical perspective we proceed by decomposing an arbitrary dataset into several subsets that are in a certain sense pseudo45;random.
