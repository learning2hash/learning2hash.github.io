We show an optimal data-dependent hashing scheme for the approximate near neighbor problem. For an \(n\)-point data set in a \(d\)-dimensional space our data structure achieves query time \(O(d n^\&amp;\#123;\rho+o(1)\&amp;\#125;)\) and space $O(n^&amp;\#123;1+\rho+o(1)&amp;\#125; + dn)\(, where \)\rho=\tfrac&amp;\#123;1&amp;\#125;&amp;\#123;2c^2-1&amp;\#125;$ for the Euclidean space and approximation \(c>1\). For the Hamming space, we obtain an exponent of \(\rho=\tfrac\&amp;\#123;1\&amp;\#125;\&amp;\#123;2c-1\&amp;\#125;\). Our result completes the direction set forth in [AINR14] who gave a proof-of-concept that data-dependent hashing can outperform classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In contrast to [AINR14], the new bound is not only optimal, but in fact improves over the best (optimal) LSH data structures [IM98,AI06] for all approximation factors \(c>1\). From the technical perspective, we proceed by decomposing an arbitrary dataset into several subsets that are, in a certain sense, pseudo-random.
