We show an optimal data-dependent hashing scheme for the approximate near neighbor problem. For an \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-point data set in a \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-dimensional space our data structure achieves query time \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(d n^\{\rho+o(1)\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and space $O(n^\{1+\rho+o(1)\} + dn)\{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(, where \\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}\rho=\tfrac\{1\}\{2c^2-1\}$ for the Euclidean space and approximation \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c>1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. For the Hamming space, we obtain an exponent of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho=\tfrac\{1\}\{2c-1\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. Our result completes the direction set forth in [AINR14] who gave a proof-of-concept that data-dependent hashing can outperform classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In contrast to [AINR14], the new bound is not only optimal, but in fact improves over the best (optimal) LSH data structures [IM98,AI06] for all approximation factors \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c>1\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. From the technical perspective, we proceed by decomposing an arbitrary dataset into several subsets that are, in a certain sense, pseudo-random.
