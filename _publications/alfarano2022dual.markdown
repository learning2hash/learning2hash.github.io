We are concerned with linear redundancy storage schemes regarding their
ability to provide concurrent (local) recovery of multiple data objects. This
paper initiates a study of such systems within the classical coding theory. We
show how we can use the structural properties of the generator matrix defining
the scheme to obtain a bounding polytope for the set of data access rates the
system can support. We derive two dual distance outer bounds, which are sharp
for some large classes of matrix families.
