Anti-Muslim hate speech has emerged within memes, characterized by
context-dependent and rhetorical messages using text and images that seemingly
mimic humor but convey Islamophobic sentiments. This work presents a novel
dataset and proposes a classifier based on the Vision-and-Language Transformer
(ViLT) specifically tailored to identify anti-Muslim hate within memes by
integrating both visual and textual representations. Our model leverages joint
modal embeddings between meme images and incorporated text to capture nuanced
Islamophobic narratives that are unique to meme culture, providing both high
detection accuracy and interoperability.
