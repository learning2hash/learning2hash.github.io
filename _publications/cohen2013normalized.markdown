Normalized Google distance (NGD) is a relative semantic distance based on the
World Wide Web (or any other large electronic database, for instance Wikipedia)
and a search engine that returns aggregate page counts. The earlier NGD between
pairs of search terms (including phrases) is not sufficient for all
applications. We propose an NGD of finite multisets of search terms that is
better for many applications. This gives a relative semantics shared by a
multiset of search terms. We give applications and compare the results with
those obtained using the pairwise NGD. The derivation of NGD method is based on
Kolmogorov complexity.
