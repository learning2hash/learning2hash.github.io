A result of Chebyshev (1864) and Hoeffding1956\}, on bounding an expectation
of a given function with respect to a Bernoulli convolution (also called
Poisson binomial law, or law of the number of successes in independent trials)
with any given first moment, is here generalised to the case of any given first
few moments, as indicated in the title.
  A nonprobabilistic, and perhaps more obvious, reformulation is: Every
permutation invariant and separately affine-linear function of \(n\) real
variables \(x_i\in[a,b]\) assumes its extremal values given the power sums
\(\sum_\{i=1\}^nx_i^1,\ldots, \sum_\{i=1\}^nx_i^r\) at vectors \(x\) with at most \(r\)
coordinate values different from \(a\) and \(b\).
