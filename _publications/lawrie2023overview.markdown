This is the first year of the TREC Neural CLIR (NeuCLIR) track, which aims to
study the impact of neural approaches to cross-language information retrieval.
The main task in this year's track was ad hoc ranked retrieval of Chinese,
Persian, or Russian newswire documents using queries expressed in English.
Topics were developed using standard TREC processes, except that topics
developed by an annotator for one language were assessed by a different
annotator when evaluating that topic on a different language. There were 172
total runs submitted by twelve teams.
