Zero45;Shot Hashing aims at learning a hashing model that is trained only by instances from seen categories but can generate well to those of unseen categories. Typically it is achieved by utilizing a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen domain to unseen domain. Existing efforts mainly focus on single45;modal retrieval task especially Image45;Based Image Retrieval (IBIR). However as a highlighted research topic in the field of hashing cross45;modal retrieval is more common in real world applications. To address the Cross45;Modal Zero45;Shot Hashing (CMZSH) retrieval task we propose a novel Attribute45;Guided Network (AgNet) which can perform not only IBIR but also Text45;Based Image Retrieval (TBIR). In particular AgNet aligns different modal data into a semantically rich attribute space which bridges the gap caused by modality heterogeneity and zero45;shot setting. We also design an effective strategy that exploits the attribute to guide the generation of hash codes for image and text within the same network. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (AwA SUN and ImageNet) demonstrate the superiority of AgNet on both cross45;modal and single45;modal zero45;shot image retrieval tasks.
