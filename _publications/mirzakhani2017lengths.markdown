We prove Poisson approximation results for the bottom part of the length
spectrum of a random closed hyperbolic surface of large genus. Here, a random
hyperbolic surface is a surface picked at random using the Weil-Petersson
volume form on the corresponding moduli space. As an application of our result,
we compute the large genus limit of the expected systole.
