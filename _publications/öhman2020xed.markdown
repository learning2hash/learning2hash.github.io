We introduce XED, a multilingual fine-grained emotion dataset. The dataset
consists of human-annotated Finnish (25k) and English sentences (30k), as well
as projected annotations for 30 additional languages, providing new resources
for many low-resource languages. We use Plutchik's core emotions to annotate
the dataset with the addition of neutral to create a multilabel multiclass
dataset. The dataset is carefully evaluated using language-specific BERT models
and SVMs to show that XED performs on par with other similar datasets and is
therefore a useful tool for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.
