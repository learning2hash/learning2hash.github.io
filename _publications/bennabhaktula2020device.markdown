One of the challenging problems in digital image forensics is the capability
to identify images that are captured by the same camera device. This knowledge
can help forensic experts in gathering intelligence about suspects by analyzing
digital images. In this paper, we propose a two-part network to quantify the
likelihood that a given pair of images have the same source camera, and we
evaluated it on the benchmark Dresden data set containing 1851 images from 31
different cameras. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones
addressing the challenge of device-based image matching. Though the proposed
approach is not yet forensics ready, our experiments show that this direction
is worth pursuing, achieving at this moment 85 percent accuracy. This ongoing
work is part of the EU-funded project 4NSEEK concerned with forensics against
child sexual abuse.
