Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superior capability
for extracting information from raw signals in computer vision. Recently,
character-level and multi-channel CNNs have exhibited excellent performance for
sentence classification tasks. We apply CNNs to large-scale authorship
attribution, which aims to determine an unknown text's author among many
candidate authors, motivated by their ability to process character-level
signals and to differentiate between a large number of classes, while making
fast predictions in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. We extensively
evaluate CNN-based approaches that leverage word and character channels and
compare them against state-of-the-art methods for a large range of author
numbers, shedding new light on traditional approaches. We show that
character-level CNNs outperform the state-of-the-art on four out of five
datasets in different domains. Additionally, we present the first application
of authorship attribution to reddit.
