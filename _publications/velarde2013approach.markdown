We present a novel method of classification and segmentation of melodies in
symbolic representation. The method is based on filtering pitch as a signal
over time with the Haar-wavelet, and we evaluate it on two tasks. The filtered
signal corresponds to a single-scale signal ws from the continuous Haar wavelet
transform. The melodies are first segmented using local maxima or
zero-crossings of w_s. The segments of w_s are then classified using the
k-nearest neighbour algorithm with Euclidian and city-block distances. The
method proves more effective than using unfiltered pitch signals and
Gestalt-based segmentation when used to recognize the parent works of segments
from Bach's Two-Part Inventions (BWV 772-786). When used to classify 360 Dutch
folk tunes into 26 tune families, the performance of the method is comparable
to the use of pitch signals, but not as good as that of string-matching methods
based on multiple features.
