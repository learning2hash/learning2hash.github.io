Motivated by many recent constructions of permutation polynomials over
\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^2\}\), we study permutation polynomials over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^3\}\) in
terms of their coefficients. Based on the multivariate method and resultant
elimination, we construct several new classes of sparse permutation polynomials
over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q^3\}\), \(q=p^\{k\}\), \(p\geq3\). Some of them are complete
mappings.
