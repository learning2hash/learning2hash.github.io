We present the first sample compression algorithm for nearest neighbors with
non-trivial performance guarantees. We complement these guarantees by
demonstrating almost matching hardness lower bounds, which show that our bound
is nearly optimal. Our result yields new insight into margin-based nearest
neighbor classification in metric spaces and allows us to significantly sharpen
and simplify existing bounds. Some encouraging empirical results are also
presented.
