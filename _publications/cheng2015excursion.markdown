Let \\(X= \\{X(p), p\in M\\}\\) be a centered Gaussian random field, where \\(M\\) is a
smooth Riemannian manifold. For a suitable compact subset \\(D\subset M\\), we
obtain the approximations to excursion probability \\(\mathbb\{P\}\\{\sup_\{p\in D\}
X(p) \ge u \\}\\), as \\(u\to \infty\\), for two cases: (i) \\(X\\) is smooth and
isotropic; (ii) \\(X\\) is non-smooth and locally isotropic. For case (i), the
expected Euler characteristic approximation is formulated explicitly; while for
case (ii), it is shown that the asymptotics is similar to Pickands'
approximation on Euclidean space which involves Pickands' constant and the
volume of \\(D\\). These extend the results in \citep\{Cheng:2014\} from sphere to
general Riemannian manifolds.
