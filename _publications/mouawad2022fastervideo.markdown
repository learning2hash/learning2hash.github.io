Object detection and tracking in videos represent essential and
computationally demanding building blocks for current and future visual
perception systems. In order to reduce the efficiency gap between available
methods and computational requirements of real-world applications, we propose
to re-think one of the most successful methods for image object detection,
Faster R-CNN, and extend it to the video domain. Specifically, we extend the
detection framework to learn instance-level embeddings which prove beneficial
for data association and re-identification purposes. Focusing on the
computational aspects of detection and tracking, our proposed method reaches a
very high computational efficiency necessary for relevant applications, while
still managing to compete with recent and state-of-the-art methods as shown in
the experiments we conduct on standard object tracking benchmarks
