A code equivalence between index coding and network coding was established,
which shows that any index-coding instance can be mapped to a network-coding
instance, for which any index code can be translated to a network code with the
same decoding-error performance, and vice versa. Also, any network-coding
instance can be mapped to an index-coding instance with a similar code
translation. In this paper, we extend the equivalence to secure index coding
and secure network coding, where eavesdroppers are present in the networks, and
any code construction needs to guarantee security constraints in addition to
decoding-error performance.
