In this paper we introduce a novel method for general semantic segmentation
that can benefit from general semantics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Our segmentation proposes visually and semantically coherent image segments. We
use binary encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of the
clustering on the high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary codes are
very robust against noise and non-semantic changes in the image. These binary
encoding can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the
network. This results in real-time segmentation. To the best of our knowledge
our method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using
CNN. All the previous papers were limited to few number of category of the
images (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Experiments show that our segmentation algorithm
outperform the state-of-the-art non-semantic segmentation methods by large
margin.
