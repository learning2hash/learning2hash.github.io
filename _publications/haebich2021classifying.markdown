This proposal is for the creation and annotation of an egocentric video data
set of hazardous cycling situations. The resulting data set will facilitate
projects to improve the safety and experience of cyclists. Since cyclists are
highly sensitive to road surface conditions and hazards they require more
detail about road conditions when navigating their route. Features such as tram
tracks, cobblestones, gratings, and utility access points can pose hazards or
uncomfortable riding conditions for their journeys. Possible uses for the data
set are identifying existing hazards in cycling infrastructure for municipal
authorities, real time hazard and surface condition warnings for cyclists, and
the identification of conditions that cause cyclists to make sudden changes in
their immediate route.
