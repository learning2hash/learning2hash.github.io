The Novelties corpus is a collection of novels (and parts of novels)
annotated for Alias Resolution, among other tasks. This document describes the
guidelines applied during the annotation process. It contains the instructions
used by the annotators, as well as a number of examples retrieved from the
annotated novels, and illustrating how canonical names should be defined, and
which names should be considered as referring to the same entity.
