In this short survey we concern ourselves with minimal codes, a classical
object in coding theory. We will explain the relation between minimal codes and
various other mathematical domains, in particular with finite projective
geometry. This latter connection has sparked a renewed interest in minimal
codes, giving rise to new constructions as well as new questions.
