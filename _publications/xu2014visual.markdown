Images have become one of the most popular types of media through which users
convey their emotions within online social networks. Although vast amount of
research is devoted to sentiment analysis of textual data, there has been very
limited work that focuses on analyzing sentiment of image data. In this work,
we propose a novel visual sentiment prediction framework that performs image
understanding with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, the
proposed sentiment prediction framework performs transfer learning from a CNN
with millions of parameters, which is pre-trained on large-scale data for
object recognition. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets from
Twitter and Tumblr demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual
sentiment analysis framework.
