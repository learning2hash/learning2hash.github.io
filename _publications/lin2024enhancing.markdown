In analyzing vast amounts of digitally stored historical image data, existing
content-based retrieval methods often overlook significant non-semantic
information, limiting their effectiveness for flexible exploration across varied
themes. To broaden the applicability of image retrieval methods for diverse
purposes and uncover more general patterns, we innovatively introduce a crucial
factor from computational aesthetics, namely image composition, into this topic.
By explicitly integrating composition-related information extracted by CNN into
the designed retrieval model, our method considers both the image's composition
rules and semantic information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the image retrieval network guided by composition information
outperforms those relying solely on content information, facilitating the
identification of images in databases closer to the target image in human
perception. Please visit https://github.com/linty5/CCBIR to try our codes.
