We seek to build a large collection of images with ground truth labels to be used for object
detection and recognition research. Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation
and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large
dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety
of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the
art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset
to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering
of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision
and images from the web.
