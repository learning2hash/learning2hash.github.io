Identifying kinship relations has garnered interest due to several
applications such as organizing and tagging the enormous amount of videos being
uploaded on the Internet. Existing research in kinship verification primarily
focuses on kinship prediction with image pairs. In this research, we propose a
new deep learning framework for kinship verification in unconstrained videos
using a novel Supervised Mixed Norm regularization Autoencoder (SMNAE). This
new autoencoder formulation introduces class-specific sparsity in the weight
matrix. The proposed three-stage SMNAE based kinship verification framework
utilizes the learned spatio-temporal representation in the video frames for
verifying kinship in a pair of videos. A new kinship video (KIVI) database of
more than 500 individuals with variations due to illumination, pose, occlusion,
ethnicity, and expression is collected for this research. It comprises a total
of 355 true kin video pairs with over 250,000 still frames. The effectiveness
of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the KIVI database and six existing
kinship databases. On the KIVI database, SMNAE yields video-based kinship
verification accuracy of 83.18% which is at least 3.2% better than existing
algorithms. The algorithm is also evaluated on six publicly available kinship
databases and compared with best-reported results. It is observed that the
proposed SMNAE consistently yields best results on all the databases
