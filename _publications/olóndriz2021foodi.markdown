In this paper we introduce the FooDI-ML dataset. This dataset contains over
1.5M unique images and over 9.5M store names, product names descriptions, and
collection sections gathered from the Glovo application. The data made
available corresponds to food, drinks and groceries products from 37 countries
in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The dataset comprehends
33 languages, including 870K samples of languages of countries from Eastern
Europe and Western Asia such as Ukrainian and Kazakh, which have been so far
underrepresented in publicly available visio-linguistic datasets. The dataset
also includes widely spoken languages such as Spanish and English. To assist
further research, we include benchmarks over two tasks: text-image retrieval
and conditional image generation.
