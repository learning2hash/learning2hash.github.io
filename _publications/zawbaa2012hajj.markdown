In this note, new Hajj and Umrah Event Recognition datasets (HUER) are
presented. The demonstrated datasets are based on videos and images taken
during 2011-2012 Hajj and Umrah seasons. HUER is the first collection of
datasets covering the six types of Hajj and Umrah ritual events (rotating in
Tawaf around Kabaa, performing Sa'y between Safa and Marwa, standing on the
mount of Arafat, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, staying two or three days in
Mina, and throwing Jamarat). The HUER datasets also contain video and image
databases for nine types of human actions during Hajj and Umrah (walking,
drinking from Zamzam water, sleeping, smiling, eating, praying, sitting,
shaving hairs and ablutions, reading the holy Quran and making duaa). The
spatial resolutions are 1280 x 720 pixels for images and 640 x 480 pixels for
videos and have lengths of 20 seconds in average with 30 frame per second
rates.
