We show that there is no cyclically monotone stationary matching of two
independent Poisson processes in dimension \\(d=2\\). The proof combines the
harmonic approximation result from \cite\{GHO\} with local asymptotics for the
two-dimensional matching problem for which we give a new self-contained proof
using martingale arguments.
