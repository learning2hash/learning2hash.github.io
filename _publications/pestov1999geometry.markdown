We suggest that the curse of dimensionality affecting the similarity-based search in large datasets is a manifestation of the phenomenon of concentration of measure on high-dimensional structures. We prove that, under certain geometric assumptions on the query domain \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}\Omega\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} and the dataset \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}X\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}, if \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}\Omega\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} satisfies the so-called concentration property, then for most query points \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}x^\ast\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} the ball of radius \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}(1+\e)d\_X(x^\ast)\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} centred at \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}x^\ast\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} contains either all points of \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}X\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} or else at least \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}C\_1\exp(-C\_2\e^2n)\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} of them. Here \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}d\_X(x^\ast)\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} is the distance from \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}x^\ast\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} to the nearest neighbour in \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}X\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} and \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}n\{\{ '\}\}' \}\} is the dimension of \{\{ '\{\{' \}\}\Omega\{\{ '\}\}' \}\}.
