<p>We suggest that the curse of dimensionality affecting the
similarity-based search in large datasets is a manifestation of the
phenomenon of concentration of measure on high-dimensional structures.
We prove that, under certain geometric assumptions on the query domain
<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and the dataset <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> satisfies the so-called
concentration property, then for most query points <span
class="math inline">\(x^\ast\)</span> the ball of radius <span
class="math inline">\((1+\e)d_X(x^\ast)\)</span> centred at <span
class="math inline">\(x^\ast\)</span> contains either all points of
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or else at least <span
class="math inline">\(C_1\exp(-C_2\e^2n)\)</span> of them. Here <span
class="math inline">\(d_X(x^\ast)\)</span> is the distance from <span
class="math inline">\(x^\ast\)</span> to the nearest neighbour in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the dimension of <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
