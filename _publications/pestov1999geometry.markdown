We suggest that the curse of dimensionality affecting the similarity-based search in large datasets is a manifestation of the phenomenon of concentration of measure on high-dimensional structures. We prove that, under certain geometric assumptions on the query domain \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\Omega\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and the dataset \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, if \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\Omega\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} satisfies the so-called concentration property, then for most query points \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(x^\ast\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} the ball of radius \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\((1+\e)d\_X(x^\ast)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} centred at \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(x^\ast\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} contains either all points of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} or else at least \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(C\_1\exp(-C\_2\e^2n)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} of them. Here \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\_X(x^\ast)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is the distance from \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(x^\ast\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} to the nearest neighbour in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(X\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is the dimension of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\Omega\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
