We consider the problem of Private Information Retrieval with Private Side
Information (PIR-PSI), wherein a user wants to retrieve a file from replication
based non-colluding databases by using the prior knowledge of a subset of the
files stored on the databases. The PIR-PSI framework ensures that the privacy
of the demand and the side information are jointly preserved, thereby finding
potential applications when multiple files have to be downloaded spread across
different time-instants. Although the capacity of the PIR-PSI setting is known,
we observe that the underlying capacity achieving code construction uses
Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes thereby contributing to high
computational complexity when retrieving the demand. Pointing at this drawback
of MDS-based PIR-PSI codes, we propose XOR-based PIR-PSI codes for a simple yet
non-trivial setting of two non-colluding databases and two side information
files at the user. While our codes offer substantial reduction in complexity
when compared to MDS based codes, the code-rate marginally falls short of the
capacity of the PIR-PSI setting. Nevertheless, we show that our code-rate is
strictly higher than that of XOR-based codes for PIR with no side information,
thereby implying that our codes can be useful when downloading multiple files
in a sequential manner, instead of applying XOR-based PIR codes on each file.
