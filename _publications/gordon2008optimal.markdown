One way to find closest pairs in large datasets is to use hash functions. In
recent years locality-sensitive hash functions for various metrics have been
given: projecting an n-cube onto k bits is simple hash function that performs
well. In this paper we investigate alternatives to projection. For various
parameters hash functions given by complete decoding algorithms for codes work
better, and asymptotically random codes perform better than projection.
