Organize songs, albums, and artists in groups with shared similarity could be
done with the help of genre labels. In this paper, we present a novel approach
for automatic classifying musical genre in Brazilian music using only the song
lyrics. This kind of classification remains a challenge in the field of Natural
Language Processing. We construct a dataset of 138,368 Brazilian song lyrics
distributed in 14 genres. We apply SVM, Random Forest and a Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network combined with different word embeddings
techniques to address this classification task. Our experiments show that the
BLSTM method outperforms the other models with an F1-score average of \(0.48\).
Some genres like "gospel", "funk-carioca" and "sertanejo", which obtained 0.89,
0.70 and 0.69 of F1-score, respectively, can be defined as the most distinct
and easy to classify in the Brazilian musical genres context.
