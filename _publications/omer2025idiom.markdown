Idiom detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the computerized
process of recognizing figurative expressions within a text that convey
meanings beyond the literal interpretation of the words. While idiom detection
has seen significant progress across various languages, the Kurdish language
faces a considerable research gap in this area despite the importance of idioms
in tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis. This study addresses
idiom detection in Sorani Kurdish by approaching it as a text classification
task using deep learning techniques. To tackle this, we developed a dataset
containing 10,580 sentences embedding 101 Sorani Kurdish idioms across diverse
contexts. Using this dataset, we developed and evaluated three deep learning
models: KuBERT-based transformer sequence classification, a Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), and a BiLSTM model with an attention
mechanism. The evaluations revealed that the transformer model, the fine-tuned
BERT, consistently outperformed the others, achieving nearly 99% accuracy while
the RCNN achieved 96.5% and the BiLSTM 80%. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Transformer-based architectures in low-resource languages like
Kurdish. This research provides a dataset, three optimized models, and insights
into idiom detection, laying a foundation for advancing Kurdish NLP.
