We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2019 Task 6 on
Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval).
The task was based on a new dataset, the Offensive Language Identification
Dataset (OLID), which contains over 14,000 English tweets. It featured three
sub-tasks. In sub-task A, the goal was to discriminate between offensive and
non-offensive posts. In sub-task B, the focus was on the type of offensive
content in the post. Finally, in sub-task C, systems had to detect the target
of the offensive posts. OffensEval attracted a large number of participants and
it was one of the most popular tasks in SemEval-2019. In total, about 800 teams
signed up to participate in the task, and 115 of them submitted results, which
we present and analyze in this report.
