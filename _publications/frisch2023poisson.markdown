We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products
\(A\wr B= \bigoplus_\{B\} A\rtimes B\) of countable groups \(A\) and \(B\), for
probability measures \(\mu\) with finite entropy where lamp configurations
stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of \(\mu\) to \(B\) is
Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of \((A\wr B,\mu)\) is equal to the
space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting
measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and
Lyons-Peres, for \(B=\mathbb\{Z\}^d\), \(d\ge 3\), and measures \(\mu\) with a finite
first moment.
