We extend the equivalence between network coding and index coding by Effros,
El Rouayheb, and Langberg to the secure communication setting in the presence
of an eavesdropper. Specifically, we show that the most general versions of
secure network-coding setup by Chan and Grant and the secure index-coding setup
by Dau, Skachek, and Chee, which also include the randomised encoding setting,
are equivalent.
