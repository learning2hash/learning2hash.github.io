This study investigates ImageBind's ability to generate meaningful fused
multimodal embeddings for online auto parts listings. We propose a simplistic
embedding fusion workflow that aims to capture the overlapping information of
image/text pairs, ultimately combining the semantics of a post into a joint
embedding. After storing such fused embeddings in a vector database, we
experiment with dimensionality reduction and provide empirical evidence to
convey the semantic quality of the joint embeddings by clustering and examining
the posts nearest to each cluster centroid. Additionally, our initial findings
with ImageBind's emergent zero-shot cross-modal retrieval suggest that pure
audio embeddings can correlate with semantically similar marketplace listings,
indicating potential avenues for future research.
