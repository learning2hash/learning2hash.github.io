The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a widely used feature descriptor
in computer vision for the purpose of object detection. In the paper, a
modified HOG descriptor is described, it uses a lookup table and the method of
integral image to speed up the detection performance by a factor of 5~10. By
exploiting the special hardware features of a given platform(e.g. a digital
signal processor), further improvement can be made to the HOG descriptor in
order to have real-time object detection and tracking.
