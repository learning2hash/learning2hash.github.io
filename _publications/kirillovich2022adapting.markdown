The paper is dedicated to the use of LodView for navigation over the
multilingual Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud. First, we define the class of
Pubby-like tools, that LodView belongs to, and clarify the relation of this
class to the classes of URI dereferenciation tools, RDF browsers and LOD
visualization tools. Second, we reveal several limitations of LodView that
impede its use for the designated purpose, and propose improvements to be made
for fixing these limitations. These improvements are: 1) resolution of Cyrillic
URIs; 2) decoding Cyrillic URIs in Turtle representations of resources; 3)
support of Cyrillic literals; 4) user-friendly URLs for RDF representations of
resources; 5) support of hash URIs; 6) expanding nested resources; 7) support
of RDF collections; 8) pagination of resource property values; and 9) support
of \(\LaTeX\) math notation. Third, we partially implement several of the
proposed improvements.
