We discuss quantitative estimates of the local spectral dimension of the
two-dimensional Sierpinski gasket. The present arguments were inspired by a
previous study of the distribution of the Kusuoka measure by R. Bell, C.-W. Ho,
and R. S. Strichartz [Energy measures of harmonic functions on the Sierpi\'nski
gasket, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 63 (2014), 831-868].
