We present a very simple, unsupervised method for the pairwise matching of
documents from heterogeneous collections. We demonstrate our method with the
Concept-Project matching task, which is a binary classification task involving
pairs of documents from heterogeneous collections. Although our method only
employs standard resources without any domain- or task-specific modifications,
it clearly outperforms the more complex system of the original authors. In
addition, our method is transparent, because it provides explicit information
about how a similarity score was computed, and efficient, because it is based
on the aggregation of (pre-computable) word-level similarities.
