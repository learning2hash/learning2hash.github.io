The emph123;Sparse Johnson45;Lindenstrauss Transform125; of Kane and Nelson (SODA 2012) provides a linear dimensionality45;reducing map A in R^123;m × u125; in ell95;2 that preserves distances up to distortion of 1 + varepsilon with probability 1 45; δ where m = O(varepsilon^123;45;2125; log 1/δ) and each column of A has O(varepsilon m) non45;zero entries. The previous analyses of the Sparse Johnson45;Lindenstrauss Transform all assumed access to a Omega(log 1/δ)45;wise independent hash function. The main contribution of this paper is a more general analysis of the Sparse Johnson45;Lindenstrauss Transform with less assumptions on the hash function. We also show that the emph123;Mixed Tabulation hash function125; of Dahlgaard Knudsen Rotenberg and Thorup (FOCS 2015) satisfies the conditions of our analysis thus giving us the first analysis of a Sparse Johnson45;Lindenstrauss Transform that works with a practical hash function.
