Despite the plethora of born-digital content, vast troves of important
content remain accessible only on physical media such as paper or microfilm.
The traditional approach to indexing undigitized content is using manually
created metadata that describes it at some level of aggregation (e.g., folder,
box, or collection). Searchers led in this way to some subset of the content
often must then manually examine substantial quantities of physical media to
find what they are looking for. This paper proposes a complementary approach,
in which selective digitization of a small portion of the content is used as a
basis for proximity-based indexing as a way of bringing the user closer to the
specific content for which they are looking. Experiments with 35 boxes of
partially digitized US State Department records indicate that box-level indexes
built in this way can provide a useful basis for search.
