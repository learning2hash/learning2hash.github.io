Low-cardinality activations permit an algorithm based on fetching the
inference values from pre-calculated lookup tables instead of calculating them
every time. This algorithm can have extensions, some of which offer abilities
beyond those of the currently used algorithms. It also allows for a simpler and
more effective CNN-specialized hardware.
