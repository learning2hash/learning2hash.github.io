We consider the problem of embedding a relation, represented as a directed
graph, into Euclidean space. For three types of embeddings motivated by the
recent literature on knowledge graphs, we obtain characterizations of which
relations they are able to capture, as well as bounds on the minimal
dimensionality and precision needed.
