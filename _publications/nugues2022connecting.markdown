The \textit\{Petit Larousse illustr\'e\} is a French dictionary first published
in 1905. Its division in two main parts on language and on history and
geography corresponds to a major milestone in French lexicography as well as a
repository of general knowledge from this period. Although the value of many
entries from 1905 remains intact, some descriptions now have a dimension that
is more historical than contemporary. They are nonetheless significant to
analyze and understand cultural representations from this time. A comparison
with more recent information or a verification of these entries would require a
tedious manual work. In this paper, we describe a new lexical resource, where
we connected all the dictionary entries of the history and geography part to
current data sources. For this, we linked each of these entries to a wikidata
identifier. Using the wikidata links, we can automate more easily the
identification, comparison, and verification of historically-situated
representations. We give a few examples on how to process wikidata identifiers
and we carried out a small analysis of the entities described in the dictionary
to outline possible applications. The resource, i.e. the annotation of 20,245
dictionary entries with wikidata links, is available from GitHub
