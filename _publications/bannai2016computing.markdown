Given a string on an integer alphabet, we present an algorithm that computes
the set of all distinct squares belonging to this string in time linear to the
string length. As an application, we show how to compute the tree topology of
the minimal augmented suffix tree in linear time. Asides from that, we
elaborate an algorithm computing the longest previous table in a succinct
representation using compressed working space.
