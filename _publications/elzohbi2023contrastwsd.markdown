This paper presents ContrastWSD, a RoBERTa-based metaphor detection model
that integrates the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) to extract and contrast the contextual meaning with the
basic meaning of a word to determine whether it is used metaphorically in a
sentence. By utilizing the word senses derived from a WSD model, our model
enhances the metaphor detection process and outperforms other methods that rely
solely on contextual embeddings or integrate only the basic definitions and
other external knowledge. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark
datasets and compare it with strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness in
advancing metaphor detection.
