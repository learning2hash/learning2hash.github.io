A sunflower is a family of sets that have the same pairwise intersections. We
simplify a recent result of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang that gives an upper
bound on the size of every family of sets of size \(k\) that does not contain a
sunflower. We show how to use the converse of Shannon's noiseless coding
theorem to give a cleaner proof of their result.
