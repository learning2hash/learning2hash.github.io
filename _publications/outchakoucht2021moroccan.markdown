Darija Open Dataset (DODa) is an open-source project for the Moroccan
dialect. With more than 10,000 entries DODa is arguably the largest open-source
collaborative project for Darija-English translation built for Natural Language
Processing purposes. In fact, besides semantic categorization, DODa also adopts
a syntactic one, presents words under different spellings, offers verb-to-noun
and masculine-to-feminine correspondences, contains the conjugation of hundreds
of verbs in different tenses, and many other subsets to help researchers better
understand and study Moroccan dialect. This data paper presents a description
of DODa, its features, how it was collected, as well as a first application in
Image Classification using ImageNet labels translated to Darija. This
collaborative project is hosted on GitHub platform under MIT's Open-Source
license and aims to be a standard resource for researchers, students, and
anyone who is interested in Moroccan Dialect
