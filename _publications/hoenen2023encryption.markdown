It is possible to interpret text as numbers (and vice versa) if one interpret
letters and other characters as digits and assume that they have an inherent
immutable ordering. This is demonstrated by the conventional digit set of the
hexadecimal system of number coding, where the letters ABCDEF in this exact
alphabetic sequence stand each for a digit and thus a numerical value. In this
article, we consequently elaborate this thought and include all symbols and the
standard ordering of the unicode standard for digital character coding. We show
how this can be used to form digit sets of different sizes and how subsequent
simple conversion between bases can result in encryption mimicking results of
wrong encoding and accidental noise. Unfortunately, because of encoding
peculiarities, switching bases to a higher one does not necessarily result in
efficient disk space compression automatically.
