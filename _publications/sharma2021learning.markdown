This paper provides a novel framework that learns canonical embeddings for
non-rigid shape matching. In contrast to prior work in this direction, our
framework is trained end-to-end and thus avoids instabilities and constraints
associated with the commonly-used Laplace-Beltrami basis or sequential
optimization schemes. On multiple datasets, we demonstrate that learning self
symmetry maps with a deep functional map projects 3D shapes into a low
dimensional canonical embedding that facilitates non-rigid shape correspondence
via a simple nearest neighbor search. Our framework outperforms multiple recent
learning based methods on FAUST and SHREC benchmarks while being
computationally cheaper, data-efficient, and robust.
