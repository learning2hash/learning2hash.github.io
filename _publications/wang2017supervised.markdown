Recently, hashing methods have been widely used in large-scale image retrieval.
However, most existing hashing methods did not consider the hierarchical
relation of labels, which means that they ignored the rich information stored in
the hierarchy. Moreover, most of previous works treat each bit in a hash code
equally, which does not meet the scenario of hierarchical labeled data. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, called supervised hierarchical
deep hashing (SHDH), to perform hash code learning for hierarchical labeled
data. Specifically, we define a novel similarity formula for hierarchical
labeled data by weighting each layer, and design a deep convolutional neural
network to obtain a hash code for each data point. Extensive experiments on
several real-world public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.
