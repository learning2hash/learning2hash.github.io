The automatic discovery of behaviour is of high importance when aiming to
assess and improve the quality of life of people. Egocentric images offer a
rich and objective description of the daily life of the camera wearer. This
work proposes a new method to identify a person's patterns of behaviour from
collected egocentric photo-streams. Our model characterizes time-frames based
on the context (place, activities and environment objects) that define the
images composition. Based on the similarity among the time-frames that describe
the collected days for a user, we propose a new unsupervised greedy method to
discover the behavioural pattern set based on a novel semantic clustering
approach. Moreover, we present a new score metric to evaluate the performance
of the proposed algorithm. We validate our method on 104 days and more than
100k images extracted from 7 users. Results show that behavioural patterns can
be discovered to characterize the routine of individuals and consequently their
lifestyle.
