We present WineGraph, an extended version of FlavorGraph, a heterogeneous
graph incorporating wine data into its structure. This integration enables
food-wine pairing based on taste and sommelier-defined rules. Leveraging a food
dataset comprising 500,000 reviews and a wine reviews dataset with over 130,000
entries, we computed taste descriptors for both food and wine. This information
was then utilised to pair food items with wine and augment FlavorGraph with
additional data. The results demonstrate the potential of heterogeneous graphs
to acquire supplementary information, proving beneficial for wine pairing.
