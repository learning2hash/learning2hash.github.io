We design a data-dependent metric in \(\mathbb R^d\) and use it to define the
\(k\)-nearest neighbors of a given point. Our metric is invariant under all
affine transformations. We show that, with this metric, the standard
\(k\)-nearest neighbor regression estimate is asymptotically consistent under the
usual conditions on \(k\), and minimal requirements on the input data.
