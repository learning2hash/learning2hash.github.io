We introduce in this paper a runtime-efficient tree hashing algorithm for the identification of isomorphic subtrees with two important applications in genetic programming for symbolic regression fast online calculation of population diversity and algebraic simplification of symbolic expression trees. Based on this hashing approach we propose a simple diversity-preservation mechanism with promising results on a collection of symbolic regression benchmark problems.
