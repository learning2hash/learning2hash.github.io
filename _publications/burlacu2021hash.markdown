    We introduce in this paper a runtime-efficient tree hashing algorithm for the identification of isomorphic subtrees, with two important applications in genetic programming for symbolic regression: fast, online calculation of population diversity and algebraic simplification of symbolic expression trees. Based on this hashing approach, we propose a simple diversity-preservation mechanism with promising results on a collection of symbolic regression benchmark problems.
