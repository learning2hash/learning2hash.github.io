We consider an n-dimensional Brownian Motion trapped inside a bounded convex
set by normally-reflecting boundaries. It is well-known that this process is
uniformly ergodic. However, the rates of this ergodicity are not
well-understood, especially in the regime of very high-dimensional sets. Here
we present new bounds on these rates for convex sets with a given diameter. Our
bounds do not depend upon the smoothness of the boundary nor the value of the
ambient dimension, n.
