Demographics, in particular, gender, age, and race, are a key predictor of
human behavior. Despite the significant effect that demographics plays, most
scientific studies using online social media do not consider this factor,
mainly due to the lack of such information. In this work, we use
state-of-the-art face analysis software to infer gender, age, and race from
profile images of 350K Twitter users from New York. For the period from
November 1, 2014 to October 31, 2015, we study which hashtags are used by
different demographic groups. Though we find considerable overlap for the most
popular hashtags, there are also many group-specific hashtags.
