Motivated by the duplication-correcting problem for data storage in live DNA,
we study the construction of constant-weight codes in \(\ell_1\)-metric. By using
packings and group divisible designs in combinatorial design theory, we give
constructions of optimal codes over non-negative integers and optimal ternary
codes with \(\ell_1\)-weight \(w\leq 4\) for all possible distances. In general, we
derive the size of the largest ternary code with constant weight \(w\) and
distance \(2w-2\) for sufficiently large length \(n\) satisfying \(n\equiv
1,w,-w+2,-2w+3\pmod\{w(w-1)\}\).
