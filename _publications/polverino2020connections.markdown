The aim of this paper is to survey on the known results on maximum scattered
linear sets and MRD-codes. In particular, we investigate the link between these
two areas. In "A new family of linear maximum rank distance codes" (2016)
Sheekey showed how maximum scattered linear sets of \(\mathrm\{PG\}(1,q^n)\) define
square MRD-codes. Later in "Maximum scattered linear sets and MRD-codes" (2017)
maximum scattered linear sets in \(\mathrm\{PG\}(r-1,q^n)\), \(r>2\), were used to
construct non square MRD-codes. Here, we point out a new relation regarding the
other direction. We also provide an alternative proof of the well-known
Blokhuis-Lavrauw's bound for the rank of maximum scattered linear sets shown in
"Scattered spaces with respect to a spread in \(\mathrm\{PG\}(n,q)\)" (2000).
