We study higher order convexity properties of random point sets in the unit
square. Given \(n\) uniform i.i.d random points, we derive asymptotic estimates
for the maximal number of them which are in \(k\)-monotone position, subject to
mild boundary conditions. Besides determining the order of magnitude of the
expectation, we also prove strong concentration estimates. We provide a general
framework that includes the previously studied cases of \(k=1\) (longest
increasing sequences) and \(k=2\) (longest convex chains).
