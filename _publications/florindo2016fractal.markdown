This work presents a novel descriptor for texture images based on fractal
geometry and its application to image analysis. The descriptors are provided by
estimating the triangular prism fractal dimension under different scales with a
weight exponential parameter, followed by dimensionality reduction using
Karhunen-Lo\`\{e\}ve transform. The efficiency of the proposed descriptors is
tested on two well-known texture data sets, that is, Brodatz and Vistex, both
for classification and image retrieval. The novel method is also tested
concerning invariances in situations when the textures are rotated or affected
by Gaussian noise. The obtained results outperform other classical and
state-of-the-art descriptors in the literature and demonstrate the power of the
triangular descriptors in these tasks, suggesting their use in practical
applications of image analysis based on texture features.
