A cube-like graph is a Cayley graph for the elementary abelian group of order
\\(2^n\\). In studies of the chromatic number of cube-like graphs, the \\(k\\)th power
of the \\(n\\)-dimensional hypercube, \\(Q_n^k\\), is frequently considered. This
coloring problem can be considered in the framework of coding theory, as the
graph \\(Q_n^k\\) can be constructed with one vertex for each binary word of length
\\(n\\) and edges between vertices exactly when the Hamming distance between the
corresponding words is at most \\(k\\). Consequently, a proper coloring of \\(Q_n^k\\)
corresponds to a partition of the \\(n\\)-dimensional binary Hamming space into
codes with minimum distance at least \\(k+1\\). The smallest open case, the
chromatic number of \\(Q_8^2\\), is here settled by finding a 13-coloring. Such
13-colorings with specific symmetries are further classified.
