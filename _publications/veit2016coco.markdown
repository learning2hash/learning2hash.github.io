This paper describes the COCO-Text dataset. In recent years large-scale
datasets like SUN and Imagenet drove the advancement of scene understanding and
object recognition. The goal of COCO-Text is to advance state-of-the-art in
text detection and recognition in natural images. The dataset is based on the
MS COCO dataset, which contains images of complex everyday scenes. The images
were not collected with text in mind and thus contain a broad variety of text
instances. To reflect the diversity of text in natural scenes, we annotate text
with (a) location in terms of a bounding box, (b) fine-grained classification
into machine printed text and handwritten text, (c) classification into legible
and illegible text, (d) script of the text and (e) transcriptions of legible
text. The dataset contains over 173k text annotations in over 63k images. We
provide a statistical analysis of the accuracy of our annotations. In addition,
we present an analysis of three leading state-of-the-art photo Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) approaches on our dataset. While scene text
detection and recognition enjoys strong advances in recent years, we identify
significant shortcomings motivating future work.
