Learning rich and compact representations is an open topic in many fields
such as object recognition or image retrieval. Deep neural networks have made a
major breakthrough during the last few years for these tasks but their
representations are not necessary as rich as needed nor as compact as expected.
To build richer representations, high order statistics have been exploited and
have shown excellent performances, but they produce higher dimensional
features. While this drawback has been partially addressed with factorization
schemes, the original compactness of first order models has never been
retrieved, or at the cost of a strong performance decrease. Our method, by
jointly integrating codebook strategy to factorization scheme, is able to
produce compact representations while keeping the second order performances
with few additional parameters. This formulation leads to state-of-the-art
results on three image retrieval datasets.
