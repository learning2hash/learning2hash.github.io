To benchmark Bengali digit recognition algorithms, a large publicly available
dataset is required which is free from biases originating from geographical
location, gender, and age. With this aim in mind, NumtaDB, a dataset consisting
of more than 85,000 images of hand-written Bengali digits, has been assembled.
This paper documents the collection and curation process of numerals along with
the salient statistics of the dataset.
