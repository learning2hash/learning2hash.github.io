We present an algorithm for computing upper bounds for the Online Bin
Stretching Problem with a small number of bins and the resulting upper bounds
for 4, 5 and 6 bins. This both demonstrates the possibility of using computer
search for upper bounds on a fundamentally real-valued online problem and
improves upon the best bounds know so far, some of which have remained
unchanged since 2001.
