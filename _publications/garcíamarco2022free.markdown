In this work, we explore the relationship between free resolution of some
monomial ideals and Generalized Hamming Weights (GHWs) of binary codes. More
precisely, we look for a structure smaller than the set of codewords of minimal
support that provides us some information about the GHWs. We prove that the
first and second generalized Hamming weight of a binary linear code can be
computed (by means of a graded free resolution) from a set of monomials
associated to a binomial ideal related with the code. Moreover, the remaining
weights are bounded by the Betti numbers for that set.
