We introduce WonderJourney, a modularized framework for perpetual 3D scene
generation. Unlike prior work on view generation that focuses on a single type
of scenes, we start at any user-provided location (by a text description or an
image) and generate a journey through a long sequence of diverse yet coherently
connected 3D scenes. We leverage an LLM to generate textual descriptions of the
scenes in this journey, a text-driven point cloud generation pipeline to make a
compelling and coherent sequence of 3D scenes, and a large VLM to verify the
generated scenes. We show compelling, diverse visual results across various
scene types and styles, forming imaginary "wonderjourneys". Project website:
