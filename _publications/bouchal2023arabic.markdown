Segmentation of Arabic manuscripts into lines of text and words is an
important step to make recognition systems more efficient and accurate. The
problem of segmentation into text lines is solved since there are carefully
annotated dataset dedicated to this task. However, To the best of our
knowledge, there are no dataset annotating the word position of Arabic texts.
In this paper, we present a new dataset specifically designed for historical
Arabic script in which we annotate position in word level.
