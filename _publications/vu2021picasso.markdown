Today, Machine Learning (ML) applications can have access to tens of
thousands of features. With such feature sets, efficiently browsing and
curating subsets of most relevant features is a challenge. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to visualize up to several thousands of features in a
single image. The image not only shows information on individual features, but
also expresses feature interactions via the relative positioning of features.
