Compression-based similarity measures are effectively employed in
applications on diverse data types with a basically parameter-free approach.
Nevertheless, there are problems in applying these techniques to
medium-to-large datasets which have been seldom addressed. This paper proposes
a similarity measure based on compression with dictionaries, the Fast
Compression Distance (FCD), which reduces the complexity of these methods,
without degradations in performance. On its basis a content-based color image
retrieval system is defined, which can be compared to state-of-the-art methods
based on invariant color features. Through the FCD a better understanding of
compression-based techniques is achieved, by performing experiments on datasets
which are larger than the ones analyzed so far in literature.
