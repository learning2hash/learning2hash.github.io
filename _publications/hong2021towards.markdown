Visual object localization is the key step in a series of object detection
tasks. In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the
mainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require
object-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown
categories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,
a self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object
localization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed
framework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their
corresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared
between the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance
can be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.
In addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of
few-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework. Superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods is observed on both tasks.
