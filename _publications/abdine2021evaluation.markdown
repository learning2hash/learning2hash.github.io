Distributed word representations are popularly used in many tasks in natural
language processing. Adding that pretrained word vectors on huge text corpus
achieved high performance in many different NLP tasks. This paper introduces
multiple high-quality word vectors for the French language where two of them
are trained on massive crawled French data during this study and the others are
trained on an already existing French corpus. We also evaluate the quality of
our proposed word vectors and the existing French word vectors on the French
word analogy task. In addition, we do the evaluation on multiple real NLP tasks
that shows the important performance enhancement of the pre-trained word
vectors compared to the existing and random ones. Finally, we created a demo
web application to test and visualize the obtained word embeddings. The
produced French word embeddings are available to the public, along with the
finetuning code on the NLU tasks and the demo code.
