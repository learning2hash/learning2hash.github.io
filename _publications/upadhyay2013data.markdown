In this paper a novel approach for matrix manipulation and indexing is
proposed .Here the elements in a row of matrix are designated by numeric value
called permutation index followed by the elements of the row being randomised.
This is done for all the rows of the matrix and in the end the set of
permutation indices are put in the parent matrix and random locations depending
on a pre decided scheme called passkey. This passkey is used to put back the
elements of all the rows back in the correct sequence. This approach finds
application in data encapsulation and hiding.
