Over the recent months it has become clear that the current generation of
cryptographic hashing algorithms are insufficient to meet future needs. The ASH
family of algorithms provides modifications to the existing SHA-2 family. These
modifications are designed with two main goals: 1) Providing increased collision
resistance. 2) Increasing mitigation of security risks post-collision. The
unique public/private sections and salt/pepper design elements provide increased
flexibility for a broad range of applications. The ASH family is a new
generation of cryptographic hashing algorithms.
