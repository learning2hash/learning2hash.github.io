In this paper, the uniformly asymptotic normality for sample quantiles of
associated random variables is investigated under some conditions on the decay
of the covariances. We obtain the rate of normal approximation of order
\\(O(n^\{-1/2\}log^2 n)\\) if the covariances decrease exponentially to \\(0\\). The
best rate is shown as \\(O(n^\{-1/3\})\\) under a polynomial decay of the
covariances.
