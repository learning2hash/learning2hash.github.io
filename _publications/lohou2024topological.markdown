In this paper, we adapt the two topological numbers, which have been proposed
to efficiently characterize simple points in specific neighborhoods for 3D
binary images, to the case of 2D binary images. Unlike the 3D case, we only use
a single neighborhood to define these two topological numbers for the 2D case.
Then, we characterize simple points either by using the two topological numbers
or by a single topological number linked to another one condition. We compare
the characterization of simple points by topological numbers with two other
ones based on Hilditch crossing number and Yokoi number. We also highlight the
number of possible configurations corresponding to a simple point, which also
represents the maximum limit of local configurations that a thinning algorithm
operating by parallel deletion of simple (individual) points may delete while
preserving topology (limit usually not reachable, depending on the deletion
strategy).
