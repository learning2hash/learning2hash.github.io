Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) locates, retrieves and displays images
alike to one given as a query, using a set of features. It demands accessible
data in medical archives and from medical equipment, to infer meaning after
some processing. A problem similar in some sense to the target image can aid
clinicians. CBIR complements text-based retrieval and improves evidence-based
diagnosis, administration, teaching, and research in healthcare. It facilitates
visual/automatic diagnosis and decision-making in real-time remote
consultation/screening, store-and-forward tests, home care assistance and
overall patient surveillance. Metrics help comparing visual data and improve
diagnostic. Specially designed architectures can benefit from the application
scenario. CBIR use calls for file storage standardization, querying procedures,
efficient image transmission, realistic databases, global availability, access
simplicity, and Internet-based structures. This chapter recommends important
and complex aspects required to handle visual content in healthcare.
