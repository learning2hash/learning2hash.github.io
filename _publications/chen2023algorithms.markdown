Permutation resemblance measures the distance of a function from being a
permutation. Here we show how to determine the permutation resemblance through
linear integer programming techniques. We also present an algorithm for
constructing feasible solutions to this integer program, and use it to prove an
upper bound for permutation resemblance for some special functions.
Additionally, we present a generalization of the linear integer program that
takes a function on a finite group and determines a permutation with the lowest
differential uniformity among those most resembling it.
