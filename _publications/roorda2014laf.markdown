The Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) provides a general, extensible
stand-off markup system for corpora. This paper discusses LAF-Fabric, a new
tool to analyse LAF resources in general with an extension to process the
Hebrew Bible in particular. We first walk through the history of the Hebrew
Bible as text database in decennium-wide steps. Then we describe how LAF-Fabric
may serve as an analysis tool for this corpus. Finally, we describe three
analytic projects/workflows that benefit from the new LAF representation:
  1) the study of linguistic variation: extract cooccurrence data of common
nouns between the books of the Bible (Martijn Naaijer); 2) the study of the
grammar of Hebrew poetry in the Psalms: extract clause typology (Gino Kalkman);
3) construction of a parser of classical Hebrew by Data Oriented Parsing:
generate tree structures from the database (Andreas van Cranenburgh).
