We propose to leverage concept-level representations for complex event
recognition in photographs given limited training examples. We introduce a
novel framework to discover event concept attributes from the web and use that
to extract semantic features from images and classify them into social event
categories with few training examples. Discovered concepts include a variety of
objects, scenes, actions and event sub-types, leading to a discriminative and
compact representation for event images. Web images are obtained for each
discovered event concept and we use (pretrained) CNN features to train concept
classifiers. Extensive experiments on challenging event datasets demonstrate
that our proposed method outperforms several baselines using deep CNN features
directly in classifying images into events with limited training examples. We
also demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall accuracy on a
dataset with unseen event categories using a single training example.
