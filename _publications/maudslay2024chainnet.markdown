The senses of a word exhibit rich internal structure. In a typical lexicon,
this structure is overlooked: a word's senses are encoded as a list without
inter-sense relations. We present ChainNet, a lexical resource which for the
first time explicitly identifies these structures. ChainNet expresses how
senses in the Open English Wordnet are derived from one another: every nominal
sense of a word is either connected to another sense by metaphor or metonymy,
or is disconnected in the case of homonymy. Because WordNet senses are linked
to resources which capture information about their meaning, ChainNet represents
the first dataset of grounded metaphor and metonymy.
