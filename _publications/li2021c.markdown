Minwise hashing (MinHash) is an important and practical algorithm for
generating random hashes to approximate the Jaccard (resemblance) similarity in
massive binary (0/1) data. The basic theory of MinHash requires applying
hundreds or even thousands of independent random permutations to each data
vector in the dataset, in order to obtain reliable results for (e.g.,) building
large-scale learning models or approximate near neighbor search in massive
data. In this paper, we propose \{\bf Circulant MinHash (C-MinHash)\} and provide
the surprising theoretical results that we just need \textbf\{two\} independent
random permutations. For C-MinHash, we first conduct an initial permutation on
the data vector, then we use a second permutation to generate hash values.
Basically, the second permutation is re-used \(K\) times via circulant shifting
to produce \(K\) hashes. Unlike classical MinHash, these \(K\) hashes are obviously
correlated, but we are able to provide rigorous proofs that we still obtain an
unbiased estimate of the Jaccard similarity and the theoretical variance is
uniformly smaller than that of the classical MinHash with \(K\) independent
permutations. The theoretical proofs of C-MinHash require some non-trivial
efforts. Numerical experiments are conducted to justify the theory and
demonstrate the effectiveness of C-MinHash.
