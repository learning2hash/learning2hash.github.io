We investigate first-passage percolation on the lattice \(\Z^d\) for dimensions
\(d \geq 2\). Each edge \(e\) of the graph is assigned an independent copy of a
non-negative random variable \(\tau\). We only assume \(\P[\tau=0]0\) is explicit)
for the probability of having two disjoint geodesics between two pairs of
neighbouring vertices at distance \(n\). Additionally, under more specific
assumptions on the distribution of \(\tau\), we obtain similar lower bounds for
the probability of having two disjoint geodesics (except for their starting and
ending points) between the same two vertices.
