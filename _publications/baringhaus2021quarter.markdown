We introduce and discuss a multivariate version of the classical median that
is based on an equipartition property with respect to quarter spaces. These
arise as pairwise intersections of the half-spaces associated with the
coordinate hyperplanes of an orthogonal basis. We obtain results on existence,
equivariance, and asymptotic normality.
