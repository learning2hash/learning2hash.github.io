The Aho-Corasick algorithm is multiple patterns searching algorithm running
sequentially in various applications like network intrusion detection and
bioinformatics for finding several input strings within a given large input
string. The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as
Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesn't need failure
links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we
implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm
to the general purpose graphics processing unit by applying several cache
optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick
algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick
algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of
graphics processing units for matching DNA sequences.
