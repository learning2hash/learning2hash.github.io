The hair and beauty industry is a fast-growing industry. This led to the
development of various applications, such as virtual hair dyeing or hairstyle
transfer, to satisfy the customer's needs. Although several hairstyle datasets
are available for these applications, they often consist of a relatively small
number of images with low resolution, thus limiting their performance on
high-quality hair editing. In response, we introduce a novel large-scale Korean
hairstyle dataset, K-hairstyle, containing 500,000 high-resolution images. In
addition, K-hairstyle includes various hair attributes annotated by Korean
expert hairstylists as well as hair segmentation masks. We validate the
effectiveness of our dataset via several applications, such as hair dyeing,
hairstyle transfer, and hairstyle classification. K-hairstyle is publicly
available at https://psh01087.github.io/K-Hairstyle/.
