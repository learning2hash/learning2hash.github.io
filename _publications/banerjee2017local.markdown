In this paper, a new texture descriptor based on the local neighborhood
intensity difference is proposed for content based image retrieval (CBIR). For
computation of texture features like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), the center
pixel in a 3*3 window of an image is compared with all the remaining neighbors,
one pixel at a time to generate a binary bit pattern. It ignores the effect of
the adjacent neighbors of a particular pixel for its binary encoding and also
for texture description. The proposed method is based on the concept that
neighbors of a particular pixel hold a significant amount of texture information
that can be considered for efficient texture representation for CBIR. Taking
this into account, we develop a new texture descriptor, named as Local
Neighborhood Intensity Pattern (LNIP) which considers the relative intensity
difference between a particular pixel and the center pixel by considering its
adjacent neighbors and generate a sign and a magnitude pattern. Since sign and
magnitude patterns hold complementary information to each other, these two
patterns are concatenated into a single feature descriptor to generate a more
concrete and useful feature descriptor. The proposed descriptor has been tested
for image retrieval on four databases, including three texture image databases -
Brodatz texture image database, MIT VisTex database and Salzburg texture
database and one face database AT&T face database. The precision and recall
values observed on these databases are compared with some state-of-art local
patterns. The proposed method showed a significant improvement over many other
existing methods.
