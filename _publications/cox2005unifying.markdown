In this paper we consider the Skorokhod embedding problem in Brownian motion.
In particular, we give a solution based on the local time at zero of a variably
skewed Brownian motion related to the underlying Brownian motion. Special cases
of the construction include the Azema-Yor and Vallois embeddings. In turn, the
construction has an interpretation in the Chacon-Walsh framework.
