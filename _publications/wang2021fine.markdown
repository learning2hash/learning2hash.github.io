Texture exists in lots of the products, such as wood, beef and compression
tea. These abundant and stochastic texture patterns are significantly different
between any two products. Unlike the traditional digital ID tracking, in this
paper, we propose a novel approach for product traceability, which directly
uses the natural texture of the product itself as the unique identifier. A
texture identification based traceability system for Pu'er compression tea is
developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution. With
tea-brick images collected from manufactures and individual users, a
large-scale dataset has been formed to evaluate the performance of tea-brick
texture verification and searching algorithm. The texture similarity approach
with local feature extraction and matching achieves the verification accuracy
of 99.6% and the top-1 searching accuracy of 98.9%, respectively.
