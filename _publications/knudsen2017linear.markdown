We consider the hash function \\(h(x) = ((ax+b) \bmod p) \bmod n\\) where \\(a,b\\) are chosen uniformly at random from \\(\&#123;0,1,\ldots,p-1\&#125;\\). We prove that when we use \\(h(x)\\) in hashing with chaining to insert \\(n\\) elements into a table of size \\(n\\) the expected length of the longest chain is \\(\tilde&#123;O&#125;\!\left(n^&#123;1/3&#125;\right)\\). The proof also generalises to give the same bound when we use the multiply-shift hash function by Dietzfelbinger et al. [Journal of Algorithms 1997].
