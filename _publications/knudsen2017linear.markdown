<p>We consider the hash function <span class="math inline">\(h(x) =
((ax+b) \bmod p) \bmod n\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> are chosen uniformly at random from
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,\ldots,p-1\}\)</span>. We prove that
when we use <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> in hashing with
chaining to insert <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements into
a table of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the expected
length of the longest chain is <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{O}\!\left(n^{1/3}\right)\)</span>. The
proof also generalises to give the same bound when we use the
multiply-shift hash function by Dietzfelbinger et al. [Journal of
Algorithms 1997].</p>
