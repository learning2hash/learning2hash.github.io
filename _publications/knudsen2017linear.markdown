We consider the hash function \\(h(x) = ((ax+b) \bmod p) \bmod n\\) where \\(a,b\\)
are chosen uniformly at random from \\(\\{0,1,\ldots,p-1\\}\\). We prove that when we
use \\(h(x)\\) in hashing with chaining to insert \\(n\\) elements into a table of size
\\(n\\) the expected length of the longest chain is
\\(\tilde\{O\}\!\left(n^\{1/3\}\right)\\). The proof also generalises to give the same
bound when we use the multiply-shift hash function by Dietzfelbinger et al.
[Journal of Algorithms 1997].
