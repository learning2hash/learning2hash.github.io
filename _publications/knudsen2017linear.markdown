We consider the hash function \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(h(x) = ((ax+b) \bmod p) \bmod n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(a,b\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} are chosen uniformly at random from \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\{0,1,\ldots,p-1\\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We prove that when we use \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(h(x)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} in hashing with chaining to insert \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} elements into a table of size \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} the expected length of the longest chain is \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\tilde\{O\}\!\left(n^\{1/3\}\right)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The proof also generalises to give the same bound when we use the multiply-shift hash function by Dietzfelbinger et al. [Journal of Algorithms 1997].
