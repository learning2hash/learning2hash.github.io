We consider the hash function (h(x) = ((ax+b) bmod p) bmod n) where (ab) are chosen uniformly at random from (01ldotsp-1). We prove that when we use (h(x)) in hashing with chaining to insert (n) elements into a table of size (n) the expected length of the longest chain is (!left(n^1/3right)). The proof also generalises to give the same bound when we use the multiply-shift hash function by Dietzfelbinger et al. Journal of Algorithms 1997.
