<p>We develop a Vector Quantized Spectral Clustering (VQSC) algorithm
that is a combination of Spectral Clustering (SC) and Vector
Quantization (VQ) sampling for grouping Soybean genomes. The inspiration
here is to use SC for its accuracy and VQ to make the algorithm
computationally cheap (the complexity of SC is cubic in-terms of the
input size). Although the combination of SC and VQ is not new, the
novelty of our work is in developing the crucial similarity matrix in SC
as well as use of k-medoids in VQ, both adapted for the Soybean genome
data. We compare our approach with commonly used techniques like UPGMA
(Un-weighted Pair Graph Method with Arithmetic Mean) and NJ (Neighbour
Joining). Experimental results show that our approach outperforms both
these techniques significantly in terms of cluster quality (up to 25%
better cluster quality) and time complexity (order of magnitude
faster).</p>
