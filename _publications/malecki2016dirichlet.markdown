We provide sharp two-sided estimates on the Dirichlet heat kernel
\\(k_1(t,x,y)\\) for the Laplacian in a ball. The result accurately describes the
exponential behaviour of the kernel for small times and significantly improves
the qualitatively sharp results known so far. As a consequence we obtain the
full description of the kernel \\(k_1(t,x,y)\\) in terms of its global two-sided
sharp estimates.
