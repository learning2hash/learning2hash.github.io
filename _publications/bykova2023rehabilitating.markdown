This paper presents a large anonymized dataset of homelessness alongside
insights into the data-driven rehabilitation of homeless people. The dataset
was gathered by a large nonprofit organization working on rehabilitating the
homeless for twenty years. This is the first dataset that we know of that
contains rich information on thousands of homeless individuals seeking
rehabilitation. We show how data analysis can help to make the rehabilitation
of homeless people more effective and successful. Thus, we hope this paper
alerts the data science community to the problem of homelessness.
