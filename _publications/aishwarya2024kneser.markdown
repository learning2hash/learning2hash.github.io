The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in
Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer.
We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This
follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about
Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a
probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo
simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the
concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also
presented.
