In recent years hashing has attracted more and more attention owing to its superior capacity of low storage cost and high query efficiency in large45;scale cross45;modal retrieval. Benefiting from deep leaning continuously compelling results in cross45;modal retrieval community have been achieved. However existing deep cross45;modal hashing methods either rely on amounts of labeled information or have no ability to learn an accuracy correlation between different modalities. In this paper we proposed Unsupervised coupled Cycle generative adversarial Hashing networks (UCH) for cross45;modal retrieval where outer45;cycle network is used to learn powerful common representation and inner45;cycle network is explained to generate reliable hash codes. Specifically our proposed UCH seamlessly couples these two networks with generative adversarial mechanism which can be optimized simultaneously to learn representation and hash codes. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets show that the proposed UCH outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art unsupervised cross45;modal hashing methods.
