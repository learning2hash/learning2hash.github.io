Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) involves extracting vehicle
license plate information from image or a video capture. These systems have
gained popularity due to the wide availability of low-cost surveillance cameras
and advances in Deep Learning. Typically, video-based ALPR systems rely on
multiple frames to detect the vehicle and recognize the license plates.
Therefore, we propose a system capable of extracting exactly one frame per
vehicle and recognizing its license plate characters from this singular image
using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model. Early experiments show that
this methodology is viable.
