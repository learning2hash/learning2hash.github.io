The ability to efficiently search pictures with annotated semantics and
emotion is an important problem for Human-Computer Interaction with
considerable interdisciplinary significance. Accuracy and speed of the
multimedia retrieval process depends on the chosen metadata annotation model.
The quality of such multifaceted retrieval is opposed to the potential
complexity of data setup procedures and development of multimedia annotations.
Additionally, a recent study has shown that databases of emotionally annotated
multimedia are still being predominately searched manually which highlights the
need to study this retrieval modality. To this regard we present a study with N
= 75 participants aimed to evaluate the influence of keywords and dimensional
emotions in manual retrieval of pictures. The study showed that if the
multimedia database is comparatively small emotional annotations are sufficient
to achieve a fast retrieval despite comparatively lesser overall accuracy. In a
larger dataset semantic annotations became necessary for efficient retrieval
although they contributed to a slower beginning of the search process. The
experiment was performed in a controlled environment with a team of psychology
experts. The results were statistically consistent with validates measures of
the participants' perceptual speed.
