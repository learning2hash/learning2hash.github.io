The existing person search methods use the annotated labels of person
identities to train deep networks in a supervised manner that requires a huge
amount of time and effort for human labeling. In this paper, we first introduce
a novel framework of person search that is able to train the network in the
absence of the person identity labels, and propose efficient unsupervised
clustering methods to substitute the supervision process using annotated person
identity labels. Specifically, we propose a hard negative mining scheme based
on the uniqueness property that only a single person has the same identity to a
given query person in each image. We also propose a hard positive mining scheme
by using the contextual information of co-appearance that neighboring persons
in one image tend to appear simultaneously in other images. The experimental
results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to that
of the state-of-the-art supervised person search methods, and furthermore
outperforms the extended unsupervised person re-identification methods on the
benchmark person search datasets.
