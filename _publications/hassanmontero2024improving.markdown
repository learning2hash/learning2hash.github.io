Tagging-based systems enable users to categorize web resources by means of
tags (freely chosen keywords), in order to refinding these resources later.
Tagging is implicitly also a social indexing process, since users share their
tags and resources, constructing a social tag index, so-called folksonomy. At
the same time of tagging-based system, has been popularised an interface model
for visual information retrieval known as Tag-Cloud. In this model, the most
frequently used tags are displayed in alphabetical order. This paper presents a
novel approach to Tag-Cloud's tags selection, and proposes the use of
clustering algorithms for visual layout, with the aim of improve browsing
experience. The results suggest that presented approach reduces the semantic
density of tag set, and improves the visual consistency of Tag-Cloud layout.
