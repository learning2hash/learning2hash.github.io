Commencing as a photo-sharing platform, Instagram has since become
multifaceted, accommodating diverse art forms, with poetry emerging as a
prominent one. However, the academic understanding of Instagram's poetry
community is limited, yet its significance emerges from its distinctive
utilization of a primarily visual social media platform guided by
recommendation algorithms for disseminating poetry, further characterized by a
predominantly novice creative population. We employ qualitative analysis to
explore motivations, experiences, and algorithmic influence within Instagram's
poetry community. We demonstrate that participants prioritize conforming to
algorithmic constraints for visibility, yet maintain their community's values
of integrity and originality, illustrating the tension between algorithmic
growth and participant authenticity. We introduce the concept of
Algorithmically Mediated Creative Labor, a phenomenon specific to
non-monetizing creative users who are impacted by the prioritization of
professional creators and continually adapt their creative endeavors to align
with platform logic, thereby affecting their motivation and creative outputs.
