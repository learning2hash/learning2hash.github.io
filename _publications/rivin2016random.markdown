We study random knots, which we define as a triple of random periodic
functions (where a random function is a random trigonometric series,
\[f(\theta) = \sum_\{k=1\}^\infty a_k \cos (k \theta) +b_k (\sin k \theta),\]
with \(a_k, b_k\) are independent gaussian random variables with mean \(0\) and
variance \(\sigma(k)^2\) - our results will depend on the functional dependence
of \(\sigma\) on \(k.\) In particular, we show that if \(\sigma(k) = k^\alpha,\) with
\(\alpha < -3/2,\) then the probability of getting a knot type which admits a
projection with \(N\) crossings, decays at least as fast as \(1/N.\) The constant
\(3/2\) is significant, because having \(\alpha < -3/2\) is exactly the condition
for \(f(\theta)\) to be a \(C^1\) function, so our class is precisely the class of
random *tame* knots. We also find some suprising experimental observations
on the zeros of Alexander polynomials of random knots (with slowly and
non-decaying coefficients), and even more surprising observations on their
coefficients. Our observations persist in other models of random knots, making
it likely that the results are universal.
