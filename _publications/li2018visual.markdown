Social relationships form the basis of social structure of humans. Developing
computational models to understand social relationships from visual data is
essential for building intelligent machines that can better interact with
humans in a social environment. In this work, we study the problem of visual
social relationship recognition in images. We propose a Dual-Glance model for
social relationship recognition, where the first glance fixates at the person
of interest and the second glance deploys attention mechanism to exploit
contextual cues. To enable this study, we curated a large scale People in
Social Context (PISC) dataset, which comprises of 23,311 images and 79,244
person pairs with annotated social relationships. Since visually identifying
social relationship bears certain degree of uncertainty, we further propose an
Adaptive Focal Loss to leverage the ambiguous annotations for more effective
learning. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, which yields state-of-the-art
performance on social relationship recognition.
