Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a task of retrieving images from
their contents. Since retrieval process is a time-consuming task in large image
databases, acceleration methods can be very useful. This paper presents a novel
method to speed up CBIR systems. In the proposed method, first Zernike moments
are extracted from query image and an interval is calculated for that query.
Images in database which are out of the interval are ignored in retrieval
process. Therefore, a database reduction occurs before retrieval which leads to
speed up. It is shown that in reduced database, relevant images to query image
are preserved and irrelevant images are throwed away. Therefore, the proposed
method speed up retrieval process and preserve CBIR accuracy, simultaneously.
