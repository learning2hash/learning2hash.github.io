Venue recommendation systems model the past interactions (i.e., check-ins) of
the users and recommend venues. Traditional recommendation systems employ
collaborative filtering, content-based filtering or matrix factorization.
Recently, vector space embedding and deep learning algorithms are also used for
recommendation. In this work, I propose a method for recommending top-k venues
by utilizing the sequentiality feature of check-ins and a recent vector space
embedding method, namely the FastText. Our proposed method; forms groups of
check-ins, learns the vector space representations of the venues and utilizes
the learned embeddings to make venue recommendations. I measure the performance
of the proposed method using a Foursquare check-in dataset.The results show
that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.
