Subspace codes are the \(q\)-analog of binary block codes in the Hamming
metric. Here the codewords are vector spaces over a finite field. They have
e.g. applications in random linear network coding, distributed storage, and
cryptography. In this chapter we survey known constructions and upper bounds
for subspace codes.
