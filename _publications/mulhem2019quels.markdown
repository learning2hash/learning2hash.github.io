We describe here an experimental framework and the results obtained on
microblogs retrieval. We study the contribution one popular approach, i.e.,
words embeddings, and investigate the impact of the training set on the learned
embedding. We focus on query expansion for the retrieval of tweets on the CLEF
CMC 2016 corpus. Our results show that using embeddings trained on a corpus in
the same domain as the indexed documents did not necessarily lead to better
retrieval results.
