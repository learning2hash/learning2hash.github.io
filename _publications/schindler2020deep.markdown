Deep Learning has become state of the art in visual computing and
continuously emerges into the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and audio
retrieval domain. In order to bring attention to this topic we propose an
introductory tutorial on deep learning for MIR. Besides a general introduction
to neural networks, the proposed tutorial covers a wide range of MIR relevant
deep learning approaches. \textbf\{Convolutional Neural Networks\} are currently
a de-facto standard for deep learning based audio retrieval. \textbf\{Recurrent
Neural Networks\} have proven to be effective in onset detection tasks such as
beat or audio-event detection. \textbf\{Siamese Networks\} have been shown
effective in learning audio representations and distance functions specific for
music similarity retrieval. We will incorporate both academic and industrial
points of view into the tutorial. Accompanying the tutorial, we will create a
Github repository for the content presented at the tutorial as well as
references to state of the art work and literature for further reading. This
repository will remain public after the conference.
