The distribution of descents in a fixed conjugacy class of \\(S_n\\) is studied,
and it is shown that its moments have an interesting property. A particular
conjugacy class that is of interest is the class of matchings (also known as
fixed point free involutions). This paper provides a bijective proof of the
symmetry of the descents and major indices of matchings and uses a generating
function approach to prove an asymptotic normality theorem for the number of
descents in matchings.
