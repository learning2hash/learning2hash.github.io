Studying caricature recognition is fundamentally important to understanding
of face perception. However, little research has been conducted in the computer
vision community, largely due to the shortage of suitable datasets. In this
paper, a new caricature dataset is built, with the objective to facilitate
research in caricature recognition. All the caricatures and face images were
collected from the Web. Compared with two existing datasets, this dataset is
much more challenging, with a much greater number of available images, artistic
styles and larger intra-personal variations. Evaluation protocols are also
offered together with their baseline performances on the dataset to allow fair
comparisons. Besides, a framework for caricature face recognition is presented
to make a thorough analyze of the challenges of caricature recognition. By
analyzing the challenges, the goal is to show problems that worth to be further
investigated. Additionally, based on the evaluation protocols and the
framework, baseline performances of various state-of-the-art algorithms are
provided. A conclusion is that there is still a large space for performance
improvement and the analyzed problems still need further investigation.
