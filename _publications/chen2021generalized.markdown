We present an assessment of the distance in total variation of
\textit\{arbitrary\} collection of prime factor multiplicities of a random number
in \\([n]=\\{1,\dots, n\\}\\) and a collection of independent geometric random
variables. More precisely, we impose mild conditions on the probability law of
the random sample and the aforementioned collection of prime multiplicities,
for which a fast decaying bound on the distance towards a tuple of geometric
variables holds. Our results generalize and complement those from Kubilius et
al. which consider the particular case of uniform samples in \\([n]\\) and
collection of "small primes". As applications, we show a generalized version of
the celebrated Erd\"os Kac theorem for not necessarily uniform samples of
numbers.
