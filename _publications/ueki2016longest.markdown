We consider the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem with the restriction
that the common subsequence is required to consist of at least \\(k\\) length
substrings. First, we show an \\(O(mn)\\) time algorithm for the problem which
gives a better worst-case running time than existing algorithms, where \\(m\\) and
\\(n\\) are lengths of the input strings. Furthermore, we mainly consider the LCS
in at least \\(k\\) length order-isomorphic substrings problem. We show that the
problem can also be solved in \\(O(mn)\\) worst-case time by an easy-to-implement
algorithm.
