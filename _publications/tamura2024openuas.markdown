We publicly release OpenUAS, a dataset of area embeddings based on urban
usage patterns, including embeddings for over 1.3 million 50-meter square
meshes covering a total area of 3,300 square kilometers. This dataset is
valuable for analyzing area functions in fields such as market analysis, urban
planning, transportation infrastructure, and infection prediction. It captures
the characteristics of each area in the city, such as office districts and
residential areas, by employing an area embedding technique that utilizes
location information typically obtained by GPS. Numerous area embedding
techniques have been proposed, and while the public release of such embedding
datasets is technically feasible, it has not been realized. One reason for this
is that previous methods could not embed areas from different cities and
periods into the same embedding space without sharing raw location data. We
address this issue by developing an anchoring method that establishes anchors
within a shared embedding space. We publicly release this anchor dataset along
with area embedding datasets from several periods in eight major Japanese
cities.
