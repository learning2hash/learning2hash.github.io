The dataset presented provides high-resolution images of real, filled out
bank checks containing various complex backgrounds, and handwritten text and
signatures in the respective fields, along with both pixel-level and
patch-level segmentation masks for the signatures on the checks. The images of
bank checks were obtained from different sources, including other publicly
available check datasets, publicly available images on the internet, as well as
scans and images of real checks. Using the GIMP graphics software, pixel-level
segmentation masks for signatures on these checks were manually generated as
binary images. An automated script was then used to generate patch-level masks.
The dataset was created to train and test networks for extracting signatures
from bank checks and other similar documents with very complex backgrounds.
