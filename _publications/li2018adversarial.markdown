Thanks to the success of deep learning cross45;modal retrieval has made significant progress recently. However there still remains a crucial bottleneck how to bridge the modality gap to further enhance the retrieval accuracy. In this paper we propose a self45;supervised adversarial hashing (textbf123;SSAH125;) approach which lies among the early attempts to incorporate adversarial learning into cross45;modal hashing in a self45;supervised fashion. The primary contribution of this work is that two adversarial networks are leveraged to maximize the semantic correlation and consistency of the representations between different modalities. In addition we harness a self45;supervised semantic network to discover high45;level semantic information in the form of multi45;label annotations. Such information guides the feature learning process and preserves the modality relationships in both the common semantic space and the Hamming space. Extensive experiments carried out on three benchmark datasets validate that the proposed SSAH surpasses the state45;of45;the45;art methods.
