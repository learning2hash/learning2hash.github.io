In this paper, we propose a novel hash function based on irregularly
decimated chaotic map. The hash function called SHAH is based on two Tinkerbell
maps filtered with irregular decimation rule. Exact study has been provided on
the novel scheme using distribution analysis, sensitivity analysis, static
analysis of diffusion and confusion, and collision analysis. The experimental
data show that SHAH satisfied admirable level of security.
