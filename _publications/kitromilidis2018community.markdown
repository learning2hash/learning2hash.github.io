In this work we look at the structure of the influences between Western art
painters as revealed by their biographies on Wikipedia. We use a modified
version of modularity maximisation with metadata to detect a partition of
artists into communities based on their artistic genre and school in which they
belong. We then use this community structure to discuss how influential artists
reached beyond their own communities and had a lasting impact on others, by
proposing modifications on standard centrality measures.
