Most image retrieval methods use global features that aggregate local
distinctive patterns into a single representation. However, the aggregation
process destroys the relative spatial information by considering orderless sets
of local descriptors. We propose to integrate relative spatial information into
the aggregation process by taking into account co-occurrences of local patterns
in a tensor framework. The resulting signature called Improved Spatial Tensor
Aggregation (ISTA) is able to reach state of the art performances on well known
datasets such as Holidays, Oxford5k and Paris6k.
