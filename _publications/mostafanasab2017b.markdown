Symbol-pair codes, introduced by Cassuto and Blaum [1], have been raised for
symbol-pair read channels. This new idea is motivated by the limitation of the
reading process in high-density data storage technologies. Yaakobi et al. [8]
introduced codes for \(b\)-symbol read channels, where the read operation is
performed as a consecutive sequence of \(b>2\) symbols. In this paper, we come up
with a method to compute the \(b\)-symbol-pair distance of two \(n\)-tuples, where
\(n\) is a positive integer. Also, we deal with the \(b\)-symbol-pair distances of
some kind of cyclic codes of length \(p^e\) over \(\mathbb\{F\}_\{p^m\}\).
