Literary theme identification and interpretation is a focal point of literary
studies scholarship. Classical forms of literary scholarship, such as close
reading, have flourished with scarcely any need for commonly defined literary
themes. However, the rise in popularity of collaborative and algorithmic
analyses of literary themes in works of fiction, together with a requirement
for computational searching and indexing facilities for large corpora, creates
the need for a collection of shared literary themes to ensure common
terminology and definitions. To address this need, we here introduce a first
draft of the Literary Theme Ontology. Inspired by a traditional framing from
literary theory, the ontology comprises literary themes drawn from the authors
own analyses, reference books, and online sources. The ontology is available at
