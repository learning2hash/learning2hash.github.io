This paper introduces a novel network architecture for the classification of
large-scale point clouds. The network is used to classify metadata from
cuneiform tablets. As more than half a million tablets remain unprocessed, this
can help create an overview of the tablets. The network is tested on a
comparison dataset and obtains state-of-the-art performance. We also introduce
new metadata classification tasks on which the network shows promising results.
Finally, we introduce the novel Maximum Attention visualization, demonstrating
that the trained network focuses on the intended features. Code available at
