We propose an \\(O(N\cdot M)\\) sorting algorithm by Machine Learning method,
which shows a huge potential sorting big data. This sorting algorithm can be
applied to parallel sorting and is suitable for GPU or TPU acceleration.
Furthermore, we discuss the application of this algorithm to sparse hash table.
