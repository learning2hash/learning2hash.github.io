Image retrieval is an important problem in the area of multimedia processing.
This paper presents two new curvelet-based algorithms for texture retrieval
which are suitable for use in constrained-memory devices. The developed
algorithms are tested on three publicly available texture datasets: CUReT,
Mondial-Marmi, and STex-fabric. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed system. Furthermore, a weighted version of the proposed retrieval
algorithm is proposed, which is shown to achieve promising results in the
classification of seismic activities.
