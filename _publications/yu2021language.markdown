Cross-lingual language tasks typically require a substantial amount of
annotated data or parallel translation data. We explore whether language
representations that capture relationships among languages can be learned and
subsequently leveraged in cross-lingual tasks without the use of parallel data.
We generate dense embeddings for 29 languages using a denoising autoencoder,
and evaluate the embeddings using the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)
and two extrinsic tasks in a zero-shot setting: cross-lingual dependency
parsing and cross-lingual natural language inference.
