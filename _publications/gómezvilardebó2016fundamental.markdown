We consider a cache network in which a single server is connected to multiple
users via a shared error free link. The server has access to a database with
\(N\) files of equal length \(F\), and serves \(K\) users each with a cache memory of
\(MF\) bits. A novel centralized coded caching scheme is proposed for scenarios
with more users than files \(N\leq K\) and cache capacities satisfying
\(\frac\{1\}\{K\}\leq M\leq\frac\{N\}\{K\}\). The proposed scheme outperforms the best
rate-memory region known in the literature if \(N\leq K\leq\frac\{N^\{2\}+1\}\{2\}\).
