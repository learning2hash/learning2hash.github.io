Many methods have been proposed to find vector representation for words, but
most rely on capturing context from the text to find semantic relationships
between these vectors. We propose a novel method of using dictionary meanings
and image depictions to find word vectors independent of any context. We use
auto-encoder on the word images to find meaningful representations and use them
to calculate the word vectors. We finally evaluate our method on word
similarity, concept categorization and outlier detection tasks. Our method
performs comparably to context-based methods while taking much less training
time.
