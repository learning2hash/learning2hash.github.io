This paper investigates the notion of learning user and item representations
in non-Euclidean space. Specifically, we study the connection between metric
learning in hyperbolic space and collaborative filtering by exploring Mobius
gyrovector spaces where the formalism of the spaces could be utilized to
generalize the most common Euclidean vector operations. Overall, this work aims
to bridge the gap between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry in recommender
systems through metric learning approach. We propose HyperML (Hyperbolic Metric
Learning), a conceptually simple but highly effective model for boosting the
performance. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that our proposed
HyperML not only outperforms their Euclidean counterparts, but also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the
effectiveness of personalized recommendation in hyperbolic geometry.
