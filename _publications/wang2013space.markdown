Using hashing techniques, this paper develops a family of space-efficient Las Vegas randomized algorithms for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(k\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-SUM problems. This family includes an algorithm that can solve 3-SUM in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(n^2)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} time and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(\sqrt\{n\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} space. It also establishes a new time-space upper bound for SUBSET-SUM, which can be solved by a Las Vegas algorithm in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O^*(2^\{(1-\sqrt\{\8/9\beta\})n\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} time and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O^*(2^\{\beta n\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} space, for any \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\beta \in [0, \9/32]\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}.
