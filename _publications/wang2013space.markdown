Using hashing techniques, this paper develops a family of space-efficient Las
Vegas randomized algorithms for \\(k\\)-SUM problems. This family includes an
algorithm that can solve 3-SUM in \\(O(n^2)\\) time and \\(O(\sqrt\{n\})\\) space. It
also establishes a new time-space upper bound for SUBSET-SUM, which can be
solved by a Las Vegas algorithm in \\(O^*(2^\{(1-\sqrt\{\8/9\beta\})n\})\\) time and
\\(O^*(2^\{\beta n\})\\) space, for any \\(\beta \in [0, \9/32]\\).
