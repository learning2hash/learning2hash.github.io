<p>Using hashing techniques, this paper develops a family of
space-efficient Las Vegas randomized algorithms for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-SUM problems. This family includes an
algorithm that can solve 3-SUM in <span
class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span> time and <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{n})\)</span> space. It also establishes a
new time-space upper bound for SUBSET-SUM, which can be solved by a Las
Vegas algorithm in <span
class="math inline">\(O^*(2^{(1-\sqrt{\8/9\beta})n})\)</span> time and
<span class="math inline">\(O^*(2^{\beta n})\)</span> space, for any
<span class="math inline">\(\beta \in [0, \9/32]\)</span>.</p>
