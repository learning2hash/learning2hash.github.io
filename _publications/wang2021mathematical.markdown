As data volumes continue to grow, searches in data are becoming increasingly
time-consuming. Classical index structures for neighbor search are no longer
sustainable due to the "curse of dimensionality". Instead, approximated index
structures offer a good opportunity to significantly accelerate the neighbor
search for clustering and outlier detection and to have the lowest possible
error rate in the results of the algorithms. Local sensing hashes is one of
those. We indicate directions to mathematically model the properties of it.
