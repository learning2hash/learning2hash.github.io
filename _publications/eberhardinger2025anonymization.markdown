The steadily increasing utilization of data-driven methods and approaches in
areas that handle sensitive personal information such as in law enforcement
mandates an ever increasing effort in these institutions to comply with data
protection guidelines. In this work, we present a system for automatically
anonymizing images of scanned documents, reducing manual effort while ensuring
data protection compliance. Our method considers the viability of further
forensic processing after anonymization by minimizing automatically redacted
areas by combining automatic detection of sensitive regions with knowledge from
a manually anonymized reference document. Using a self-supervised image model
for instance retrieval of the reference document, our approach requires only
one anonymized example to efficiently redact all documents of the same type,
significantly reducing processing time. We show that our approach outperforms
both a purely automatic redaction system and also a naive copy-paste scheme of
the reference anonymization to other documents on a hand-crafted dataset of
ground truth redactions.
