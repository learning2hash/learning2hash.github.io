    SNS providers are known to carry out the recompression and resizing of uploaded videos/images, but most conventional methods for detecting tampered videos/images are not robust enough against such operations. In addition, videos are temporally operated such as the insertion of new frames and the permutation of frames, of which operations are difficult to be detected by using conventional methods. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel method with a robust hashing algorithm for detecting temporally operated videos even when applying resizing and compression to the videos.
