In this note, we demonstrate that every binary doubly even self-dual code of
length \(40\) can be realized as the residue code of some extremal Type II
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-code. As a consequence, it is shown that there are at least
\(94356\) inequivalent extremal Type II \(\mathbb\{Z\}_4\)-codes of length \(40\).
