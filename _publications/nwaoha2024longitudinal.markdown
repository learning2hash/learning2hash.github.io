We report results of a longitudinal sentiment classification of Reddit posts
written by students of four major Canadian universities. We work with the texts
of the posts, concentrating on the years 2020-2023. By finely tuning a
sentiment threshold to a range of [-0.075,0.075], we successfully built
classifiers proficient in categorizing post sentiments into positive and
negative categories. Noticeably, our sentiment classification results are
consistent across the four university data sets.
