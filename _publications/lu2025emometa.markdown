Metaphors play a pivotal role in expressing emotions, making them crucial for emotional intelligence. The advent of multimodal data and widespread communication has led to a proliferation of multimodal metaphors, amplifying the complexity of emotion classification compared to single-mode scenarios. However, the scarcity of research on constructing multimodal metaphorical fine-grained emotion datasets hampers progress in this domain. Moreover, existing studies predominantly focus on English, overlooking potential variations in emotional nuances across languages. To address these gaps, we introduce a multimodal dataset in Chinese comprising 5,000 text-image pairs of metaphorical advertisements. Each entry is meticulously annotated for metaphor occurrence, domain relations and fine-grained emotion classification encompassing joy, love, trust, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise, anticipation, and neutral. Our dataset is publicly accessible (https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/EmoMeta), facilitating further advancements in this burgeoning field.
