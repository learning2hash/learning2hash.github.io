Many applications like audio and image processing show that sparse
representations are a powerful and efficient signal modeling technique. Finding
an optimal dictionary that generates at the same time the sparsest
representations of data and the smallest approximation error is a hard problem
approached by dictionary learning (DL). We study how DL performs in detecting
abnormal samples in a dataset of signals. In this paper we use a particular DL
formulation that seeks uniform sparse representations model to detect the
underlying subspace of the majority of samples in a dataset, using a K-SVD-type
algorithm. Numerical simulations show that one can efficiently use this
resulted subspace to discriminate the anomalies over the regular data points.
