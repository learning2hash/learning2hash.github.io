The security of patient information is important during the transfer of
medical data. A hybrid spatial domain watermarking algorithm that includes
encryption, integrity protection and steganography is proposed to strengthen
the information originality based on the authentication. The proposed algorithm
checks whether the information of patients has been deliberately changed or
not. The created code is distributed at every pixel of the medical image and
not only in the regions of noninterest pixels, while the image details are
still preserved. To enhance the security of the watermarking code, "SHA-1" is
used to get the initial key for the Symmetric Encryption Algorithm. The target
of this approach is to preserve the content of the image and the watermark
simultaneously, this is achieved by synthesizing an encrypted watermark from
one of the components of the original image and not by embedding a watermark in
the image. To evaluate the proposed code the Least Significant Bit (LSB),
Bit2SB, and Bit3SB were used. The evaluation of the proposed code showed that
the LSB is of better quality but overall the Bit2SB is better in its ability
against the active attacks up to a size of 2*2 pixels, and it preserves the
high image quality.
