This project introduces an advanced English-to-Arabic translator surpassing
conventional tools. Leveraging the Helsinki transformer (MarianMT), our
approach involves fine-tuning on a self-scraped, purely literary Arabic
dataset. Evaluations against Google Translate show consistent outperformance in
qualitative assessments. Notably, it excels in cultural sensitivity and context
accuracy. This research underscores the Helsinki transformer's superiority for
English-to-Arabic translation using a Fusha dataset.
