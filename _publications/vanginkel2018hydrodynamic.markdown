We consider the symmetric exclusion process on suitable random grids that
approximate a compact Riemannian manifold. We prove that a class of random
walks on these random grids converge to Brownian motion on the manifold. We
then consider the empirical density field of the symmetric exclusion process
and prove that it converges to the solution of the heat equation on the
manifold.
