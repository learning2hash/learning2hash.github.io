In this paper, we study two problems related to planar matchings in random
bipartite graphs. First, we colour each edge of the complete bipartite graph
\(K_\{n,n\}\) uniformly randomly from amongst \(\{r\}\) colours and show that if \(\{r\}\)
grows linearly with \(\{n\}\) then the maximum rainbow matching is a non-trivial
fraction of \(\{r\}\) with high probability, i.e. with probability converging to
one as \(\{n \rightarrow \infty\}\) Next we consider planar matchings in a
dependent setting where each vertex is forced to choose exactly one neighbour
from amongst all possible choices. We obtain estimates for the largest size of
a planar matching and also discuss the implication of our results to longest
increasing subsequences in enlarged random permutations.
