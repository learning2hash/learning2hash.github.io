    Online string matching is a computational problem involving the search for patterns or substrings in a large text dataset, with the pattern and text being processed sequentially, without prior access to the entire text. Its relevance stems from applications in data compression, data mining, text editing, and bioinformatics, where rapid and efficient pattern matching is crucial. Various solutions have been proposed over the past few decades, employing diverse techniques. Recently, weak recognition approaches have attracted increasing attention. This paper presents Hash Chain, a new algorithm based on a robust weak factor recognition approach that connects adjacent factors through hashing. Despite its O(nm) complexity, the algorithm exhibits a sublinear behavior in practice and achieves superior performance compared to the most effective algorithms.
