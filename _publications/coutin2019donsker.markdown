We compute the Wassertein-1 (or Kolmogorov-Rubinstein) distance between a
random walk in \(R^d\) and the Brownian motion. The proof is based on a new
estimate of the Lipschitz modulus of the solution of the Stein's equation. As
an application, we can evaluate the rate of convergence towards the local time
at 0 of the Brownian motion.
