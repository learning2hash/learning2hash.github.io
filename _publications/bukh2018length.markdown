Given two random finite sequences from \\([k]^n\\) such that a prefix of the
first sequence is a suffix of the second, we examine the length of their
longest common subsequence. If \\(\ell\\) is the length of the overlap, we prove
that the expected length of an LCS is approximately \\(\max(\ell,
\mathbb\{E\}[L_n])\\), where \\(L_n\\) is the length of an LCS between two independent
random sequences. We also obtain tail bounds on this quantity.
