We introduce two new measures for the dependence of \\(n \ge 2\\) random
variables: distance multivariance and total distance multivariance. Both
measures are based on the weighted \\(L^2\\)-distance of quantities related to the
characteristic functions of the underlying random variables. These extend
distance covariance (introduced by Sz\'ekely, Rizzo and Bakirov) from pairs of
random variables to \\(n\\)-tuplets of random variables. We show that total
distance multivariance can be used to detect the independence of \\(n\\) random
variables and has a simple finite-sample representation in terms of distance
matrices of the sample points, where distance is measured by a continuous
negative definite function. Under some mild moment conditions, this leads to a
test for independence of multiple random vectors which is consistent against
all alternatives.
