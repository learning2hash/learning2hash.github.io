In this work we present a large-scale dataset of \textit\{Ukiyo-e\} woodblock
prints. Unlike previous works and datasets in the artistic domain that
primarily focus on western art, this paper explores this pre-modern Japanese
art form with the aim of broadening the scope for stylistic analysis and to
provide a benchmark to evaluate a variety of art focused Computer Vision
approaches. Our dataset consists of over \(175.000\) prints with corresponding
metadata (\eg artist, era, and creation date) from the 17th century to present
day. By approaching stylistic analysis as a Multi-Task problem we aim to more
efficiently utilize the available metadata, and learn more general
representations of style. We show results for well-known baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning frameworks to enable future comparison,
and to encourage stylistic analysis on this artistic domain.
