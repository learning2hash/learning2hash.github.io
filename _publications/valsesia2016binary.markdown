We use some of the largest order statistics of the random projections of a
reference signal to construct a binary embedding that is adapted to signals
correlated with such signal. The embedding is characterized from the analytical
standpoint and shown to provide improved performance on tasks such as
classification in a reduced-dimensionality space.
