We propose a flexible procedure for large-scale image search by hash functions
with kernels. Our method treats binary codes and pairwise semantic similarity as
latent and observed variables, respectively, in a probabilistic model based on
Gaussian processes for binary classification. We present an efficient inference
algorithm with the sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) model and
parallelization. Experiments on three large-scale image dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed hashing method, Gaussian Process Hashing (GPH),
for short binary codes and the datasets without predefined classes in comparison
to the state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods.
