We present a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}-approximate nearest neighbor search in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_p\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} with \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(1<p<2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. For a database of \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} points in \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_p\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, we achieve \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(dn^\{\rho\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} query time and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(O(dn+n^\{1+\rho\})\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} space, where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho \le O((\ln c)^2/c^p)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. This improves upon the previous best upper bound \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho\le 1/c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} by Datar et al. (SOCG 2004), and is close to the lower bound \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\rho \ge 1/c^p\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} by O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (ITCS 2011). The proof is a simple generalization of the LSH scheme for \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\ell\_2\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} by Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 2006).
