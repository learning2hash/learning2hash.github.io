<p>We present a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm for <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>-approximate nearest neighbor search in
<span class="math inline">\(\ell_p\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(1&lt;p&lt;2\)</span>. For a database of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points in <span
class="math inline">\(\ell_p\)</span>, we achieve <span
class="math inline">\(O(dn^{\rho})\)</span> query time and <span
class="math inline">\(O(dn+n^{1+\rho})\)</span> space, where <span
class="math inline">\(\rho \le O((\ln c)^2/c^p)\)</span>. This improves
upon the previous best upper bound <span class="math inline">\(\rho\le
1/c\)</span> by Datar et al. (SOCG 2004), and is close to the lower
bound <span class="math inline">\(\rho \ge 1/c^p\)</span> by O’Donnell,
Wu and Zhou (ITCS 2011). The proof is a simple generalization of the LSH
scheme for <span class="math inline">\(\ell_2\)</span> by Andoni and
Indyk (FOCS 2006).</p>
