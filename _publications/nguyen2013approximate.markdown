We present a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm for c-approximate nearest neighbor search in \ell_p with 1<p<2. For a database of n points in \ell_p, we achieve O(dn^\rho) query time and O(dn+n^1+\rho) space, where \rho \le O((\ln c)^2/c^p). This improves upon the previous best upper bound \rho\le 1/c by Datar et al. (SOCG 2004), and is close to the lower bound \rho \ge 1/c^p by O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (ITCS 2011). The proof is a simple generalization of the LSH scheme for \ell_2 by Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 2006).
