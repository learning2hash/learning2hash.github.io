We present a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm for c45;approximate nearest neighbor search in ell95;p with 1<p<2. For a database of n points in ell95;p we achieve O(dn^123;ρ125;) query time and O(dn+n^123;1+ρ125;) space where ρ le O((ln c)^2/c^p). This improves upon the previous best upper bound ρle 1/c by Datar et al. (SOCG 2004) and is close to the lower bound ρ ge 1/c^p by ODonnell Wu and Zhou (ITCS 2011). The proof is a simple generalization of the LSH scheme for ell95;2 by Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 2006).
