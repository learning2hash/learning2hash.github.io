Multiple instance data are sets or multi-sets of unordered elements. Using
metrics or distances for sets, we propose an approach to several multiple
instance learning tasks, such as clustering (unsupervised learning),
classification (supervised learning), and novelty detection (semi-supervised
learning). In particular, we introduce the Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment
metric to multiple instance learning so as to provide versatile design choices.
Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data are presented to
illustrate the versatility of the proposed solution.
