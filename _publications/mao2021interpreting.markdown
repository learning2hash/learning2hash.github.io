Metaphorical expressions are difficult linguistic phenomena, challenging
diverse Natural Language Processing tasks. Previous works showed that
paraphrasing a metaphor as its literal counterpart can help machines better
process metaphors on downstream tasks. In this paper, we interpret metaphors
with BERT and WordNet hypernyms and synonyms in an unsupervised manner, showing
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline. We
also demonstrate that our method can help a machine translation system improve
its accuracy in translating English metaphors to 8 target languages.
