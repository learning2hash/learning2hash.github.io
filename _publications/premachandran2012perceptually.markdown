In this paper, we identify some of the limitations of current-day shape
matching techniques. We provide examples of how contour-based shape matching
techniques cannot provide a good match for certain visually similar shapes. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a perceptually motivated variant of the
well-known shape context descriptor. We identify that the interior properties
of the shape play an important role in object recognition and develop a
descriptor that captures these interior properties. We show that our method can
easily be augmented with any other shape matching algorithm. We also show from
our experiments that the use of our descriptor can significantly improve the
retrieval rates.
