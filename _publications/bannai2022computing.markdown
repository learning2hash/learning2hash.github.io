Given a string \(T\) with length \(n\) whose characters are drawn from an ordered
alphabet of size \(\sigma\), its longest Lyndon subsequence is a longest
subsequence of \(T\) that is a Lyndon word. We propose algorithms for finding
such a subsequence in \(O(n^3)\) time with \(O(n)\) space, or online in \(O(n^3
\sigma)\) space and time. Our first result can be extended to find the longest
common Lyndon subsequence of two strings of length \(n\) in \(O(n^4 \sigma)\) time
using \(O(n^3)\) space.
