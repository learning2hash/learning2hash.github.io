On 2\{^{nd}\} October 2012 the NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology) in the United States of America announced the new hashing algorithm
which will be adopted as standard from now on. Among a total of 73 candidates,
the winner was Keccak, designed by a group of cryptographers from Belgium and
Italy. The public selection of a new standard of cryptographic hash function
SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) took five years. Its object is to generate a hash a
fixed size from a pattern with arbitrary length. The first selection on behalf
of NIST on a standard of this family took place in 1993 when SHA-1 was chosen,
which later on was replaced by SHA-2. This paper is focused on the analysis
both from the point of view of security and the implementation of the Keccak
function, which is the base of the new SHA-3 standard. In particular, an
implementation in the mobile platform Android is presented here, providing the
first known external library in this mobile operating system so that any
developer could use the new standard hashing. Finally, the new standard in
applications in the Internet of Things is analysed.
