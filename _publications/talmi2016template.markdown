We propose a novel measure for template matching named Deformable Diversity
Similarity -- based on the diversity of feature matches between a target image
window and the template. We rely on both local appearance and geometric
information that jointly lead to a powerful approach for matching. Our key
contribution is a similarity measure, that is robust to complex deformations,
significant background clutter, and occlusions. Empirical evaluation on the
most up-to-date benchmark shows that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in its detection accuracy while improving computational
complexity.
