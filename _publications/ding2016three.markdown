For a one-dimensional simple random walk \\((S_t)\\), for each time \\(t\\) we say a
site \\(x\\) is a favorite site if it has the maximal local time. In this paper, we
show that with probability 1 three favorite sites occurs infinitely often. Our
work is inspired by T\'oth (2001), and disproves a conjecture of Erd\"\{o\}s and
R\'ev\'esz (1984) and of T\'oth (2001).
