We obtain an explicit formula for the variance of the number of \(k\)-peaks in
a uniformly random permutation. This is then used to obtain an asymptotic
formula for the variance of the length of longest \(k\)-alternating subsequence
in random permutations. Also a central limit is proved for the latter
statistic.
