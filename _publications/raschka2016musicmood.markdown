Sentiment prediction of contemporary music can have a wide-range of
applications in modern society, for instance, selecting music for public
institutions such as hospitals or restaurants to potentially improve the
emotional well-being of personnel, patients, and customers, respectively. In
this project, music recommendation system built upon on a naive Bayes
classifier, trained to predict the sentiment of songs based on song lyrics
alone. The experimental results show that music corresponding to a happy mood
can be detected with high precision based on text features obtained from song
lyrics.
