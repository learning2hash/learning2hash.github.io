Locality-sensitive hashing~IndykMotwani98 is a classical data structure for approximate nearest neighbor search. It allows after a close to linear time preprocessing of the input dataset to find an approximately nearest neighbor of any fixed query in sublinear time in the dataset size. The resulting data structure is randomized and succeeds with high probability for every fixed query. In many modern applications of nearest neighbor search the queries are chosen adaptively. In this paper we study the robustness of the locality-sensitive hashing to adaptive queries in Hamming space. We present a simple adversary that can under mild assumptions on the initial point set provably find a query to the approximate near neighbor search data structure that the data structure fails on. Crucially our adaptive algorithm finds the hard query exponentially faster than random sampling.
