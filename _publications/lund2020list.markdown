We show that a random puncturing of a code with good distance is list
recoverable beyond the Johnson bound. In particular, this implies that there
are Reed-Solomon codes that are list recoverable beyond the Johnson bound. It
was previously known that there are Reed-Solomon codes that do not have this
property. As an immediate corollary to our main theorem, we obtain better
degree bounds on unbalanced expanders that come from Reed-Solomon codes.
