In the recent past, binary similarity measures have been applied in solving
biometric identification problems, including fingerprint, handwritten character
detection, and in iris image recognition. The application of the relevant
measurements has also resulted in more accurate data analysis. This paper
surveys the applicability of binary similarity and distance measures in various
fields.
