Many link prediction algorithms require the computation of a similarity
metric on each vertex pair, which is quadratic in the number of vertices and
infeasible for large networks. We develop a class of link prediction algorithms
based on a spectral embedding and the k closest pairs algorithm that are
scalable to very large networks. We compare the prediction accuracy and runtime
of these methods to existing algorithms on several large link prediction tasks.
Our methods achieve comparable accuracy to standard algorithms but are
significantly faster.
