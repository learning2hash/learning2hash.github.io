Let \\(S\\) be the set of subsequences \\((x_\{n_k\})\\) of a given real sequence
\\((x_n)\\) which preserve the set of statistical cluster points. It has been
recently shown that \\(S\\) is a set of full (Lebesgue) measure. Here, on the other
hand, we prove that \\(S\\) is meager if and only if there exists an ordinary limit
point of \\((x_n)\\) which is not a statistical cluster point of \\((x_n)\\). This
provides a non-analogue between measure and category.
