With the growing cosmopolitan culture of modern cities, the need of robust
Multi-Lingual scene Text (MLT) detection and recognition systems has never been
more immense. With the goal to systematically benchmark and push the
state-of-the-art forward, the proposed competition builds on top of the
RRC-MLT-2017 with an additional end-to-end task, an additional language in the
real images dataset, a large scale multi-lingual synthetic dataset to assist
the training, and a baseline End-to-End recognition method. The real dataset
consists of 20,000 images containing text from 10 languages. The challenge has
4 tasks covering various aspects of multi-lingual scene text: (a) text
detection, (b) cropped word script classification, (c) joint text detection and
script classification and (d) end-to-end detection and recognition. In total,
the competition received 60 submissions from the research and industrial
communities. This paper presents the dataset, the tasks and the findings of the
presented RRC-MLT-2019 challenge.
