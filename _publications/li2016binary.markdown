For the past decades, linear codes with few weights have been widely studied,
since they have applications in space communications, data storage and
cryptography. In this paper, a class of binary linear codes is constructed and
their weight distribution is determined. Results show that they are at most
4-weight linear codes. Additionally, these codes can be used in secret sharing
schemes.
