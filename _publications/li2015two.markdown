We address the challenging large-scale content-based
face image retrieval problem, intended as searching images
based on the presence of specific subject, given one face
image of him/her. To this end, one natural demand is a supervised binary code learning method. While the learned
codes might be discriminating, people often have a further
expectation that whether some semantic message (e.g., visual attributes) can be read from the human-incomprehensible
codes. For this purpose, we propose a novel binary code
learning framework by jointly encoding identity discriminability and a number of facial attributes into unified binary code. In this way, the learned binary codes can be applied to not only fine-grained face image retrieval, but also
facial attributes prediction, which is the very innovation of
this work, just like killing two birds with one stone. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on a new purified large-scale web
celebrity database, named CFW 60K, with abundant manual identity and attributes annotation, and experimental results exhibit the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art.
