Massive biometric deployments are pervasive in today's world. But despite the
high accuracy of biometric systems, their computational efficiency degrades
drastically with an increase in the database size. Thus, it is essential to
index them. An ideal indexing scheme needs to generate codes that preserve the
intra-subject similarity as well as inter-subject dissimilarity. Here, in this
paper, we propose an iris indexing scheme using real-valued deep iris features
binarized to iris bar codes (IBC) compatible with the indexing structure.
Firstly, for extracting robust iris features, we have designed a network
utilizing the domain knowledge of ordinal filtering and learning their
nonlinear combinations. Later these real-valued features are binarized.
Finally, for indexing the iris dataset, we have proposed a loss that can
transform the binary feature into an improved feature compatible with the
Multi-Index Hashing scheme. This loss function ensures the hamming distance
equally distributed among all the contiguous disjoint sub-strings. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work in the iris indexing domain that
presents an end-to-end iris indexing structure. Experimental results on four
datasets are presented to depict the efficacy of the proposed approach.
