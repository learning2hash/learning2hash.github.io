This paper presents the Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset (SOCOFing), a
biometric fingerprint database designed for academic research purposes.
SOCOFing is made up of 6,000 fingerprint images from 600 African subjects.
SOCOFing contains unique attributes such as labels for gender, hand and finger
name as well as synthetically altered versions with three different levels of
alteration for obliteration, central rotation, and z-cut. The dataset is freely
available for noncommercial research purposes at:
