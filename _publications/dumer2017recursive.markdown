We consider recursive decoding for Reed-Muller (RM) codes and their subcodes.
Two new recursive techniques are described. We analyze asymptotic properties of
these algorithms and show that they substantially outperform other decoding
algorithms with nonexponential complexity known for RM codes. Decoding
performance is further enhanced by using intermediate code lists and
permutation procedures. For moderate lengths up to 512, near-optimum decoding
with feasible complexity is obtained.
