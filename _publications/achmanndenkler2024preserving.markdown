We introduce the Tidal Tales Plugin, a Firefox extension for efficiently
collecting and archiving of Instagram stories, addressing the challenges of
ephemeral data in social media research. It enables an automated collection of
story metadata and media files without risking account bans. It contributes to
Web Science by facilitating expansive, long-term studies with enhanced data
access and integrity.
