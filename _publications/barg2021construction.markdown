We construct a family of linear maximally recoverable codes with locality \\(r\\)
and dimension \\(r+1.\\) For codes of length \\(n\\) with \\(r\approx n^\alpha,
0\le\alpha\le 1\\) the code alphabet is of the order \\(n^\{1+3\alpha\},\\) which
improves upon the previously known constructions of maximally recoverable
codes.
