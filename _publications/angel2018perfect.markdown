We characterize the minimum-length sequences of independent lazy simple
transpositions whose composition is a uniformly random permutation. For every
reduced word of the reverse permutation there is exactly one valid way to
assign probabilities to the transpositions. It is an open problem to determine
the minimum length of such a sequence when the simplicity condition is dropped.
