The Semantic Web began to emerge as its standards and technologies developed
rapidly in the recent years. The continuing development of Semantic Web
technologies has facilitated publishing explicit semantics with data on the Web
in RDF data model. This study proposes a semantic search framework to support
efficient keyword-based semantic search on RDF data utilizing near neighbor
explorations. The framework augments the search results with the resources in
close proximity by utilizing the entity type semantics. Along with the search
results, the system generates a relevance confidence score measuring the
inferred semantic relatedness of returned entities based on the degree of
similarity. Furthermore, the evaluations assessing the effectiveness of the
framework and the accuracy of the results are presented.
