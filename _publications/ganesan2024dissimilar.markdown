For better learning, large datasets are often split into small batches and
fed sequentially to the predictive model. In this paper, we study such batch
decompositions from a probabilistic perspective. We assume that data points
(possibly corrupted) are drawn independently from a given space and define a
concept of similarity between two data points. We then consider decompositions
that restrict the amount of similarity within each batch and obtain high
probability bounds for the minimum size. We demonstrate an inherent tradeoff
between relaxing the similarity constraint and the overall size and also use
martingale methods to obtain bounds for the maximum size of data subsets with a
given similarity.
