This paper reconsiders common benchmarking approaches to nearest neighbor
search. It is shown that the concept of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID)
allows to choose query sets of a wide range of difficulty for real-world
datasets. Moreover, the effect of different LID distributions on the running
time performance of implementations is empirically studied. To this end,
different visualization concepts are introduced that allow to get a more
fine-grained overview of the inner workings of nearest neighbor search
principles. The paper closes with remarks about the diversity of datasets
commonly used for nearest neighbor search benchmarking. It is shown that such
real-world datasets are not diverse: results on a single dataset predict
results on all other datasets well.
