Weighting pixel contribution considering its location is a key feature in
many fundamental image processing tasks including filtering, object modeling
and distance matching. Several techniques have been proposed that incorporate
Spatial information to increase the accuracy and boost the performance of
detection, tracking and recognition systems at the cost of speed. But, it is
still not clear how to efficiently ex- tract weighted local histograms in
constant time using integral histogram. This paper presents a novel algorithm
to compute accurately multi-scale Spatially weighted local histograms in
constant time using Weighted Integral Histogram (SWIH) for fast search. We
applied our spatially weighted integral histogram approach for fast tracking
and obtained more accurate and robust target localization result in comparison
with using plain histogram.
