We show two-sided bounds of heat kernel for anisotropic non-singular
symmetric pure jump Markov process whose jump kernel \(J(x,y)\) is comparable to
\(\frac\{\{\bf 1\}_\{\mathcal\{V\}\}(x-y)\}\{|x-y|^\{d+\alpha\}\}\), where \(\mathcal\{V\}\) is a
union of symmetric cones, \(0<\alpha<2\) and \(x,y\in\mathbb\{R\}^d\).
