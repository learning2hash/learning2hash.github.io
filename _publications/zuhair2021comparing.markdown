Musicologists use various labels to classify similar music styles under a
shared title. But, non-specialists may categorize music differently. That could
be through finding patterns in harmony, instruments, and form of the music.
People usually identify a music genre solely by listening, but now computers
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can automate this process. The work on
applying AI in the classification of types of music has been growing recently,
but there is no evidence of such research on the Kurdish music genres. In this
research, we developed a dataset that contains 880 samples from eight different
Kurdish music genres. We evaluated two machine learning approaches, a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to recognize the
genres. The results showed that the CNN model outperformed the DNN by achieving
92% versus 90% accuracy.
