MatConvNet is an implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
MATLAB. The toolbox is designed with an emphasis on simplicity and flexibility.
It exposes the building blocks of CNNs as easy-to-use MATLAB functions,
providing routines for computing linear convolutions with filter banks, feature
pooling, and many more. In this manner, MatConvNet allows fast prototyping of
new CNN architectures; at the same time, it supports efficient computation on
CPU and GPU allowing to train complex models on large datasets such as ImageNet
ILSVRC. This document provides an overview of CNNs and how they are implemented
in MatConvNet and gives the technical details of each computational block in
the toolbox.
