<p>Nearest neighbor search aims to obtain the samples in the database
with the smallest distances from them to the queries, which is a basic
task in a range of fields, including computer vision and data mining.
Hashing is one of the most widely used methods for its computational and
storage efficiency. With the development of deep learning, deep hashing
methods show more advantages than traditional methods. In this survey,
we detailedly investigate current deep hashing algorithms including deep
supervised hashing and deep unsupervised hashing. Specifically, we
categorize deep supervised hashing methods into pairwise methods,
ranking-based methods, pointwise methods as well as quantization
according to how measuring the similarities of the learned hash codes.
Moreover, deep unsupervised hashing is categorized into similarity
reconstruction-based methods, pseudo-label-based methods and
prediction-free self-supervised learning-based methods based on their
semantic learning manners. We also introduce three related important
topics including semi-supervised deep hashing, domain adaption deep
hashing and multi-modal deep hashing. Meanwhile, we present some
commonly used public datasets and the scheme to measure the performance
of deep hashing algorithms. Finally, we discuss some potential research
directions in conclusion.</p>
