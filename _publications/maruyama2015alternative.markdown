Moran's I statistic, a popular measure of spatial autocorrelation, is
revisited. The exact range of Moran's I is given as a function of spatial
weights matrix. We demonstrate that some spatial weights matrices lead the
absolute value of upper (lower) bound larger than 1 and that others lead the
lower bound larger than -0.5. Thus Moran's I is unlike Pearson's correlation
coefficient. It is also pointed out that some spatial weights matrices do not
allow Moran's I to take positive values regardless of observations. An
alternative measure with exact range [-1,1] is proposed through a monotone
transformation of Moran's I.
