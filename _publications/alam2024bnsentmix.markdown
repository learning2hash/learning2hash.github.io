The widespread availability of code-mixed data can provide valuable insights
into low-resource languages like Bengali, which have limited datasets.
Sentiment analysis has been a fundamental text classification task across
several languages for code-mixed data. However, there has yet to be a
large-scale and diverse sentiment analysis dataset on code-mixed Bengali. We
address this limitation by introducing BnSentMix, a sentiment analysis dataset
on code-mixed Bengali consisting of 20,000 samples with 4 sentiment labels from
Facebook, YouTube, and e-commerce sites. We ensure diversity in data sources to
replicate realistic code-mixed scenarios. Additionally, we propose 14 baseline
methods including novel transformer encoders further pre-trained on code-mixed
Bengali-English, achieving an overall accuracy of 69.8% and an F1 score of
69.1% on sentiment classification tasks. Detailed analyses reveal variations in
performance across different sentiment labels and text types, highlighting
areas for future improvement.
