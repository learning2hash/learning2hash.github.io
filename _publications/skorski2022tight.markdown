This paper develops sharp bounds on moments of sums of k-wise independent
bounded random variables, under constrained average variance. The result closes
the problem addressed in part in the previous works of Schmidt et al. and
Bellare, Rompel. We The work also discuss discusses other applications of
independent interests, such as asymptotically sharp bounds on binomial moments.
