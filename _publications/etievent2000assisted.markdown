This work deals with content-based video indexing. Our viewpoint is
semi-automatic analysis of compressed video. We consider the possible
applications of motion analysis and moving object detection : assisting moving
object indexing, summarising videos, and allowing image and motion queries. We
propose an approach based on interest points. As first results, we test and
compare the stability of different types of interest point detectors in
compressed sequences.
