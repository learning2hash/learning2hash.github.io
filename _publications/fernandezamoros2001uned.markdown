We have participated in the SENSEVAL-2 English tasks (all words and lexical
sample) with an unsupervised system based on mutual information measured over a
large corpus (277 million words) and some additional heuristics. A supervised
extension of the system was also presented to the lexical sample task.
  Our system scored first among unsupervised systems in both tasks: 56.9%
recall in all words, 40.2% in lexical sample. This is slightly worse than the
first sense heuristic for all words and 3.6% better for the lexical sample, a
strong indication that unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation remains being a
strong challenge.
