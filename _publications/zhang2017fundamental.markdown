In order to characterize the fundamental limit of the tradeoff between the
amount of cache memory and the delivery transmission rate of multiuser caching
systems, various coding schemes have been proposed in the literature. These
schemes can largely be categorized into two classes, namely uncoded prefetching
schemes and coded prefetching schemes. While uncoded prefetching schemes in
general offer order-wise optimal performance, coded prefetching schemes often
have better performance at the low cache memory regime. The significant
differences in the coding components between the two classes may leave the
impression that they are largely unrelated. In this work, we provide a
connection between the uncoded prefetching scheme proposed by Maddah Ali and
Niesen (and its improved version by Yu et al) and the coded prefetching scheme
proposed by Tian and Chen. A critical observation is first given where a coding
component in the Tian-Chen scheme can be replaced by a binary .code, which
enables us to view the two schemes as the extremes of a more general scheme. An
explicit example is given to show that the intermediate operating points of
this general scheme can in fact provide new memory-rate tradeoff points
previously not known to be achievable in the literature. This new general
coding scheme is then presented and analyzed rigorously, which yields a new
inner bound to the memory-rate tradeoff for the caching problem.
