This paper presents an approach for semantic place categorization using data
obtained from RGB cameras. Previous studies on visual place recognition and
classification have shown that, by considering features derived from
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with part-based
classification models, high recognition accuracy can be achieved, even in
presence of occlusions and severe viewpoint changes. Inspired by these works,
we propose to exploit local deep representations, representing images as set of
regions applying a Na\"\{i\}ve Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) model for image
classification. As opposed to previous methods where CNNs are merely used as
feature extractors, our approach seamlessly integrates the NBNN model into a
fully-convolutional neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms previous methods based on pre-trained CNN models and
that, when employed in challenging robot place recognition tasks, it is robust
to occlusions, environmental and sensor changes.
