As working with large datasets becomes standard, the task of accurately
retrieving images containing objects of interest by an open set textual query
gains practical importance. The current leading approach utilizes a pre-trained
CLIP model without any adaptation to the target domain, balancing accuracy and
efficiency through additional post-processing. In this work, we propose FOR:
Finetuning for Object-centric Open-vocabulary Image Retrieval, which allows
finetuning on a target dataset using closed-set labels while keeping the
visual-language association crucial for open vocabulary retrieval. FOR is based
on two design elements: a specialized decoder variant of the CLIP head
customized for the intended task, and its coupling within a multi-objective
training framework. Together, these design choices result in a significant
increase in accuracy, showcasing improvements of up to 8 mAP@50 points over
SoTA across three datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that FOR is also
effective in a semi-supervised setting, achieving impressive results even when
only a small portion of the dataset is labeled.
