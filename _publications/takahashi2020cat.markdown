The analysis of daily-life fashion trends can provide us a profound
understanding of our societies and cultures. However, no appropriate digital
archive exists that includes images illustrating what people wore in their
daily lives over an extended period. In this study, we propose a new fashion
image archive, Chronicle Archive of Tokyo Street-fashion (CAT STREET), to shed
light on daily-life fashion trends. CAT STREET includes images showing what
people wore in their daily lives during 1970--2017, and these images contain
timestamps and street location annotations. This novel database combined with
machine learning enables us to observe daily-life fashion trends over a long
term and analyze them quantitatively. To evaluate the potential of our proposed
approach with the novel database, we corroborated the rules-of-thumb of two
fashion trend phenomena that have been observed and discussed qualitatively in
previous studies. Through these empirical analyses, we verified that our
approach to quantify fashion trends can help in exploring unsolved research
questions. We also demonstrate CAT STREET's potential to find new standpoints
to promote the understanding of societies and cultures through fashion embedded
in consumers' daily lives.
