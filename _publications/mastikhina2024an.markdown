This paper examines the graph partition problem and introduces a new metric, MSIDS (maximal sum of inner degrees squared). We establish its connection to the replication factor (RF) optimization, which has been the main focus of theoretical work in this field. Additionally, we propose a new partition algorithm, DBH-X, based on the DBH partitioner. We demonstrate that DBH-X significantly improves both the RF and MSIDS, compared to the baseline DBH algorithm. In addition, we provide test results that show the runtime acceleration of GraphX-based PageRank and Label propagation algorithms.
