In this paper we explore two ways of using context for object detection. The
first model focusses on people and the objects they commonly interact with,
such as fashion and sports accessories. The second model considers more general
object detection and uses the spatial relationships between objects and between
objects and scenes. Our models are able to capture precise spatial
relationships between the context and the object of interest, and make
effective use of the appearance of the contextual region. On the newly released
COCO dataset, our models provide relative improvements of up to 5% over
CNN-based state-of-the-art detectors, with the gains concentrated on hard cases
such as small objects (10% relative improvement).
