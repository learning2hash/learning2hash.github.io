This paper have two parts. In the first part we discuss word embeddings. We
discuss the need for them, some of the methods to create them, and some of
their interesting properties. We also compare them to image embeddings and see
how word embedding and image embedding can be combined to perform different
tasks. In the second part we implement a convolutional neural network trained
on top of pre-trained word vectors. The network is used for several
sentence-level classification tasks, and achieves state-of-art (or comparable)
results, demonstrating the great power of pre-trainted word embeddings over
random ones.
