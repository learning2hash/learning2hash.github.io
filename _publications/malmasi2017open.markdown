We present the first open-set language identification experiments using
one-class classification. We first highlight the shortcomings of traditional
feature extraction methods and propose a hashing-based feature vectorization
approach as a solution. Using a dataset of 10 languages from different writing
systems, we train a One- Class Support Vector Machine using only a monolingual
corpus for each language. Each model is evaluated against a test set of data
from all 10 languages and we achieve an average F-score of 0.99, highlighting
the effectiveness of this approach for open-set language identification.
