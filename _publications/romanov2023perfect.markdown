In this paper, we propose a new method for constructing \\(1\\)-perfect mixed
codes in the Cartesian product \\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{n\} \times \mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}^n\\), where
\\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{n\}\\) and \\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}\\) are finite fields of orders \\(n = q^m\\) and
\\(q\\). We consider generalized Reed-Muller codes of length \\(n = q^m\\) and order
\\((q - 1)m - 2\\). Codes whose parameters are the same as the parameters of
generalized Reed-Muller codes are called Reed-Muller-like codes. The
construction we propose is based on partitions of distance-2 MDS codes into
Reed-Muller-like codes of order \\((q - 1)m - 2\\). We construct a set of
\\(q^\{q^\{cn\}\}\\) nonequivalent 1-perfect mixed codes in the Cartesian product
\\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{n\} \times \mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}^\{n\}\\), where the constant \\(c\\) satisfies \\(c
< 1\\), \\(n = q^m\\) and \\(m\\) is a sufficiently large positive integer. We also prove
that each \\(1\\)-perfect mixed code in the Cartesian product \\(\mathbb\{F\}_\{n\}
\times \mathbb\{F\}_\{q\}^n\\) corresponds to a certain partition of a distance-2 MDS
code into Reed-Muller-like codes of order \\((q - 1)m - 2\\).
