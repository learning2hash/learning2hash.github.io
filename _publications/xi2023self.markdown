To enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models researchers have extensively explored prompting methods notably the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method which explicitly elicits human-like rationales. However they have inadvertently overlooked the potential of enhancing model reasoning performance by formulating higher-quality problems. In this work we start from the problem side and propose Self-Polish (SP) a novel method that facilitates the models reasoning by guiding it to progressively refine the given problems to be more comprehensible and solvable. We also explore several automatic prompting varients and propose the Self-Polish prompt bank for the community. SP is orthogonal to all other prompting methods of answer/reasoning side like CoT allowing for seamless integration with state-of-the-art techniques for further improvement. Thorough experiments show that the proposed method attains notable and consistent effectiveness on five reasoning benchmarks across different models. Furthermore our method also showcases impressive performance on robustness evaluation. Codes and prompts are available at https://github.com/WooooDyy/Self-Polish.
