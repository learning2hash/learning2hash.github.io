In this work we describe and compare the classic inner product and Pearson
correlation coefficient as well as the recently introduced real-valued Jaccard
and coincidence indices. Special attention is given to diverse schemes for
taking into account the signs of the operands, as well as on the study of the
geometry of the scalar field surface related to the generalized multiset binary
operations underling the considered similarity indices. The possibility to
split the classic inner product, cross-correlation, and Pearson correlation
coefficient is also described.
