Nefarious actors on social media and other platforms often spread rumors and
falsehoods through images whose metadata (e.g., captions) have been modified to
provide visual substantiation of the rumor/falsehood. This type of modification
is referred to as image repurposing, in which often an unmanipulated image is
published along with incorrect or manipulated metadata to serve the actor's
ulterior motives. We present the Multimodal Entity Image Repurposing (MEIR)
dataset, a substantially challenging dataset over that which has been
previously available to support research into image repurposing detection. The
new dataset includes location, person, and organization manipulations on
real-world data sourced from Flickr. We also present a novel, end-to-end, deep
multimodal learning model for assessing the integrity of an image by combining
information extracted from the image with related information from a knowledge
base. The proposed method is compared against state-of-the-art techniques on
existing datasets as well as MEIR, where it outperforms existing methods across
the board, with AUC improvement up to 0.23.
