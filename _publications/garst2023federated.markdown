Federated learning is a technique that enables the use of distributed
datasets for machine learning purposes without requiring data to be pooled,
thereby better preserving privacy and ownership of the data. While supervised
FL research has grown substantially over the last years, unsupervised FL
methods remain scarce. This work introduces an algorithm which implements
K-means clustering in a federated manner, addressing the challenges of varying
number of clusters between centers, as well as convergence on less separable
datasets.
