Just as computational simulations of atoms molecules and cells have shaped the way we study the sciences true-to-life simulations of human-like agents can be valuable tools for studying human behavior. We propose Humanoid Agents a system that guides Generative Agents to behave more like humans by introducing three elements of System 1 processing Basic needs (e.g. hunger health and energy) Emotion and Closeness in Relationships. Humanoid Agents are able to use these dynamic elements to adapt their daily activities and conversations with other agents as supported with empirical experiments. Our system is designed to be extensible to various settings three of which we demonstrate as well as to other elements influencing human behavior (e.g. empathy moral values and cultural background). Our platform also includes a Unity WebGL game interface for visualization and an interactive analytics dashboard to show agent statuses over time. Our platform is available on https://www.humanoidagents.com/ and code is on https://github.com/HumanoidAgents/HumanoidAgents
