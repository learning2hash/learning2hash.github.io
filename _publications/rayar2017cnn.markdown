In this paper, we present a study on sample preselection in large training
data set for CNN-based classification. To do so, we structure the input data
set in a network representation, namely the Relative Neighbourhood Graph, and
then extract some vectors of interest. The proposed preselection method is
evaluated in the context of handwritten character recognition, by using two
data sets, up to several hundred thousands of images. It is shown that the
graph-based preselection can reduce the training data set without degrading the
recognition accuracy of a non pretrained CNN shallow model.
