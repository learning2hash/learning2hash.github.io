In this paper we study the bound on three kinds of hash family using the Singleton bound. To ε45;U(N; n m) hash family in the caes of nm^21 and 1≥ε≥ ε95;1(n m) we get that the new bound is better. To ε45;bigtriangleup U(N; n m) hash family in the case of nm1 and 1≥ε≥ε95;3(nm) the new bound is better. To ε45;SU(N; n m) hash family in the case of n2^m2 and 1≥ε≥ ε95;4(n m) we get that the new bound is better.
