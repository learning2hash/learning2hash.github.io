The advent of the Microsoft Kinect three years ago stimulated not only the
computer vision community for new algorithms and setups to tackle well-known
problems in the community but also sparked the launch of several new benchmark
datasets to which future algorithms can be compared 019 to. This review of the
literature and industry developments concludes that the current RGB-D benchmark
datasets can be useful to determine the accuracy of a variety of applications
of a single or multiple RGB-D sensors.
