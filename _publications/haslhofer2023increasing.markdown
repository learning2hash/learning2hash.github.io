Law enforcement agencies are confronted with a rapidly growing number of
cryptoasset-related cases, often redundantly investigating the same cases
without mutual knowledge or shared insights. In this paper, we explore the
hypothesis that recognizing and acting upon connections between these cases can
significantly streamline investigative processes. Through an analysis of a
dataset comprising 34 cyberfraud and 1793 sextortion spam cases, we discovered
that 41% of the cyberfraud and 96.9% of the sextortion spam incidents can be
interconnected. We introduce a straightforward yet effective tool, which is
integrated into a broader cryptoasset forensics workflow and allows
investigators to highlight and share case connections. Our research
unequivocally demonstrates that recognizing case connections can lead to
remarkable efficiencies, especially when extended across crime areas,
international borders, and jurisdictions.
