With the increasing use of social networks and mobile devices, the number of
videos posted on the Internet is growing exponentially. Among the inappropriate
contents published on the Internet, pornography is one of the most worrying as
it can be accessed by teens and children. Two spatiotemporal CNNs, VGG-C3D CNN
and ResNet R(2+1)D CNN, were assessed for pornography detection in videos in
the present study. Experimental results using the Pornography-800 dataset
showed that these spatiotemporal CNNs performed better than some
state-of-the-art methods based on bag of visual words and are competitive with
other CNN-based approaches, reaching accuracy of 95.1%.
