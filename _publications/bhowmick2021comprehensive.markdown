A recommender system, also known as a recommendation system, is a type of
information filtering system that attempts to forecast a user's rating or
preference for an item. This article designs and implements a complete movie
recommendation system prototype based on the Genre, Pearson Correlation
Coefficient, Cosine Similarity, KNN-Based, Content-Based Filtering using TFIDF
and SVD, Collaborative Filtering using TFIDF and SVD, Surprise Library based
recommendation system technology. Apart from that in this paper, we present a
novel idea that applies machine learning techniques to construct a cluster for
the movie based on genres and then observes the inertia value number of
clusters were defined. The constraints of the approaches discussed in this work
have been described, as well as how one strategy overcomes the disadvantages of
another. The whole work has been done on the dataset Movie Lens present at the
group lens website which contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications
across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29,
1996, and September 24, 2018.
