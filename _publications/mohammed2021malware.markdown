We propose a novel method to detect and visualize malware through image
classification. The executable binaries are represented as grayscale images
obtained from the count of N-grams (N=2) of bytes in the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) domain and a neural network is trained for malware detection. A
shallow neural network is trained for classification, and its accuracy is
compared with deep-network architectures such as ResNet that are trained using
transfer learning. Neither dis-assembly nor behavioral analysis of malware is
required for these methods. Motivated by the visual similarity of these images
for different malware families, we compare our deep neural network models with
standard image features like GIST descriptors to evaluate the performance. A
joint feature measure is proposed to combine different features using error
analysis to get an accurate ensemble model for improved classification
performance. A new dataset called MaleX which contains around 1 million malware
and benign Windows executable samples is created for large-scale malware
detection and classification experiments. Experimental results are quite
promising with 96% binary classification accuracy on MaleX. The proposed model
is also able to generalize well on larger unseen malware samples and the
results compare favorably with state-of-the-art static analysis-based malware
detection algorithms.
