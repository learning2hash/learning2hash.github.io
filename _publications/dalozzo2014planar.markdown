Motivated by finding planar embeddings that lead to drawings with favorable
aesthetics, we study the problems MINMAXFACE and UNIFORMFACES of embedding a
given biconnected multi-graph such that the largest face is as small as
possible and such that all faces have the same size, respectively.
  We prove a complexity dichotomy for MINMAXFACE and show that deciding whether
the maximum is at most \(k\) is polynomial-time solvable for \(k \leq 4\) and
NP-complete for \(k \geq 5\). Further, we give a 6-approximation for minimizing
the maximum face in a planar embedding. For UNIFORMFACES, we show that the
problem is NP-complete for odd \(k \geq 7\) and even \(k \geq 10\). Moreover, we
characterize the biconnected planar multi-graphs admitting 3- and 4-uniform
embeddings (in a \(k\)-uniform embedding all faces have size \(k\)) and give an
efficient algorithm for testing the existence of a 6-uniform embedding.
