The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma (J-L Lemma) is a cornerstone of dimension
reduction techniques. We study it in the one-bit context, namely we consider
the unit sphere \( \mathbb S ^\{N-1\}\), with normalized geodesic metric, and map a
finite set \( \mathbf\{X\} \subset \mathbb\{S\}^\{N-1\}\) into the Hamming cube
\(\mathbb\{H\}_m = \\{0,1\\}^m\), with normalized Hamming metric. We find that for \(
0< \delta <1\), and \(m>\frac\{\ln n\}\{2\delta^2\}\) there is a \(\delta\)-RIP from
\(\mathbf\{X\}\) into \(\mathbb\{H\}_m\). This is surprising as the value of \( m\) is
virtually identical to best known bound linear J-L Lemma. In both the linear
and one-bit case, the maps are randomly constructed. We show that the
probability of \(B_m\) being a \(\delta\)-RIP satisfies a phase transition. It
passes from probability of nearly zero to nearly one with a very small change
in \(m\). Our proof relies on delicate properties of Bernoulli random variables.
