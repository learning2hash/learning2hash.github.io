An image retrieval method based on convolution neural network and dimension
reduction is proposed in this paper. Convolution neural network is used to
extract high-level features of images, and to solve the problem that the
extracted feature dimensions are too high and have strong correlation,
multilinear principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of
features. The features after dimension reduction are binary hash coded for fast
image retrieval. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper has
better retrieval effect than the retrieval method based on principal component
analysis on the e-commerce image datasets.
