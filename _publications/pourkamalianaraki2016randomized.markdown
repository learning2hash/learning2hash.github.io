Kernel-based K-means clustering has gained popularity due to its simplicity
and the power of its implicit non-linear representation of the data. A dominant
concern is the memory requirement since memory scales as the square of the
number of data points. We provide a new analysis of a class of approximate
kernel methods that have more modest memory requirements, and propose a
specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation followed by standard K-means
on the transformed data. The analysis and experiments suggest the method is
accurate, while requiring drastically less memory than standard kernel K-means
and significantly less memory than Nystrom based approximations.
