We resolve a basic problem on subspace distances that often arises in
applications: How can the usual Grassmann distance between equidimensional
subspaces be extended to subspaces of different dimensions? We show that a
natural solution is given by the distance of a point to a Schubert variety
within the Grassmannian. This distance reduces to the Grassmann distance when
the subspaces are equidimensional and does not depend on any embedding into a
larger ambient space. Furthermore, it has a concrete expression involving
principal angles, and is efficiently computable in numerically stable ways. Our
results are largely independent of the Grassmann distance --- if desired, it
may be substituted by any other common distances between subspaces. Our
approach depends on a concrete algebraic geometric view of the Grassmannian
that parallels the differential geometric perspective that is well-established
in applied and computational mathematics.
