<p>Data similarity (or distance) computation is a fundamental research
topic which fosters a variety of similarity-based machine learning and
data mining applications. In big data analytics, it is impractical to
compute the exact similarity of data instances due to high computational
cost. To this end, the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique has
been proposed to provide accurate estimators for various similarity
measures between sets or vectors in an efficient manner without the
learning process. Structured data (e.g., sequences, trees and graphs),
which are composed of elements and relations between the elements, are
commonly seen in the real world, but the traditional LSH algorithms
cannot preserve the structure information represented as relations
between elements. In order to conquer the issue, researchers have been
devoted to the family of the hierarchical LSH algorithms. In this paper,
we explore the present progress of the research into hierarchical LSH
from the following perspectives: 1) Data structures, where we review
various hierarchical LSH algorithms for three typical data structures
and uncover their inherent connections; 2) Applications, where we review
the hierarchical LSH algorithms in multiple application scenarios; 3)
Challenges, where we discuss some potential challenges as future
directions.</p>
