In the present work, a peculiar property of hash-based signatures allowing
detection of their forgery event is explored. This property relies on the fact
that a successful forgery of a hash-based signature most likely results in a
collision with respect to the employed hash function, while the demonstration
of this collision could serve as convincing evidence of the forgery. Here we
prove that with properly adjusted parameters Lamport and Winternitz one-time
signatures schemes could exhibit a forgery detection availability property.
This property is of significant importance in the framework of crypto-agility
paradigm since the considered forgery detection serves as an alarm that the
employed cryptographic hash function becomes insecure to use and the
corresponding scheme has to be replaced.
