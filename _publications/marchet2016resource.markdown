Genomic and metagenomic fields, generating huge sets of short genomic
sequences, brought their own share of high performance problems. To extract
relevant pieces of information from the huge data sets generated by current
sequencing techniques, one must rely on extremely scalable methods and
solutions. Indexing billions of objects is a task considered too expensive
while being a fundamental need in this field. In this paper we propose a
straightforward indexing structure that scales to billions of element and we
propose two direct applications in genomics and metagenomics. We show that our
proposal solves problem instances for which no other known solution scales-up.
We believe that many tools and applications could benefit from either the
fundamental data structure we provide or from the applications developed from
this structure.
