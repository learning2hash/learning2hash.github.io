Conversations in social media often contain the use of irony or sarcasm, when
the users say the opposite of what they really mean. Irony markers are the
meta-communicative clues that inform the reader that an utterance is ironic. We
propose a thorough analysis of theoretically grounded irony markers in two
social media platforms: \(Twitter\) and \(Reddit\). Classification and frequency
analysis show that for \(Twitter\), typographic markers such as emoticons and
emojis are the most discriminative markers to recognize ironic utterances,
while for \(Reddit\) the morphological markers (e.g., interjections, tag
questions) are the most discriminative.
