Dense retrieval models, which aim at retrieving the most relevant document
for an input query on a dense representation space, have gained considerable
attention for their remarkable success. Yet, dense models require a vast amount
of labeled training data for notable performance, whereas it is often
challenging to acquire query-document pairs annotated by humans. To tackle this
problem, we propose a simple but effective Document Augmentation for dense
Retrieval (DAR) framework, which augments the representations of documents with
their interpolation and perturbation. We validate the performance of DAR on
retrieval tasks with two benchmark datasets, showing that the proposed DAR
significantly outperforms relevant baselines on the dense retrieval of both the
labeled and unlabeled documents.
