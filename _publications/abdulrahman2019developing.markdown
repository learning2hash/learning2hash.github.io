Kurdish is a less-resourced language consisting of different dialects written
in various scripts. Approximately 30 million people in different countries
speak the language. The lack of corpora is one of the main obstacles in Kurdish
language processing. In this paper, we present KTC-the Kurdish Textbooks
Corpus, which is composed of 31 K-12 textbooks in Sorani dialect. The corpus is
normalized and categorized into 12 educational subjects containing 693,800
tokens (110,297 types). Our resource is publicly available for non-commercial
