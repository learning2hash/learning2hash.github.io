Motivation: Accurate detection of sequence similarity and homologous
recombination are essential parts of many evolutionary analyses. Results: We
have developed SimPlot++, an open-source multiplatform application implemented
in Python, which can be used to produce publication quality sequence similarity
plots using 63 nucleotide and 20 amino acid distance models, to detect
intergenic and intragenic recombination events using Phi, Max-X2, NSS or
proportion tests, and to generate and analyze interactive sequence similarity
networks. SimPlot++ supports multicore data processing and provides useful
distance calculability diagnostics. Availability: SimPlot++ is freely available
on GitHub at: https://github.com/Stephane-S/Simplot_PlusPlus, as both an
executable file (for Windows) and Python scripts (for Windows/Linux/MacOS).
