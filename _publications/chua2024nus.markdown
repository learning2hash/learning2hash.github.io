This paper introduces a web image dataset created by NUSs Lab for Media Search. The dataset includes (1) 269648 images and the associated tags from Flickr with a total of 5018 unique tags; (2) six types of low-level features extracted from these images including 64-D color histogram 144-D color correlogram 73-D edge direction histogram 128-D wavelet texture 225-D block-wise color moments extracted over 5x5 fixed grid partitions and 500-D bag of words based on SIFT descriptions; and (3) ground-truth for 81 concepts that can be used for evaluation. Based on this dataset we highlight characteristics of Web image collections and identify four research issues on web image annotation and retrieval. We also provide the baseline results for web image annotation by learning from the tags using the traditional k-NN algorithm. The benchmark results indicate that it is possible to learn effective models from sufficiently large image dataset to facilitate general image retrieval.
