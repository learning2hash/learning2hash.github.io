We prove bounds for the almost sure value of the Hausdorff dimension of the
limsup set of a sequence of balls in \\(\mathbf\{R\}^d\\) whose centres are
independent, identically distributed random variables. The formulas obtained
involve the rate of decrease of the radii of the balls and multifractal
properties of the measure according to which the balls are distributed, and
generalise formulas that are known to hold for particular classes of measures.
