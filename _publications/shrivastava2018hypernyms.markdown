We introduce a new measure for unsupervised hypernym detection and
directionality. The motivation is to keep the measure computationally light and
portatable across languages. We show that the relative physical location of
words in explanatory articles captures the directionality property. Further,
the phrases in section titles of articles about the word, capture the semantic
similarity needed for hypernym detection task. We experimentally show that the
combination of features coming from these two simple measures suffices to
produce results comparable with the best unsupervised measures in terms of the
average precision.
