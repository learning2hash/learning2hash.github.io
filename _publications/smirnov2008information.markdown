In this paper we present a profile-based approach to information filtering by
an analysis of the content of text documents. The Wikipedia index database is
created and used to automatically generate the user profile from the user
document collection. The problem-oriented Wikipedia subcorpora are created
(using knowledge extracted from the user profile) for each topic of user
interests. The index databases of these subcorpora are applied to filtering
information flow (e.g., mails, news). Thus, the analyzed texts are classified
into several topics explicitly presented in the user profile. The paper
concentrates on the indexing part of the approach. The architecture of an
application implementing the Wikipedia indexing is described. The indexing
method is evaluated using the Russian and Simple English Wikipedia.
