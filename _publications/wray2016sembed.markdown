We present SEMBED, an approach for embedding an egocentric object interaction
video in a semantic-visual graph to estimate the probability distribution over
its potential semantic labels. When object interactions are annotated using
unbounded choice of verbs, we embrace the wealth and ambiguity of these labels
by capturing the semantic relationships as well as the visual similarities over
motion and appearance features. We show how SEMBED can interpret a challenging
dataset of 1225 freely annotated egocentric videos, outperforming SVM
classification by more than 5%.
