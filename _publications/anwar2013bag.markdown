The field of Numismatics provides the names and descriptions of the symbols
minted on the ancient coins. Classification of the ancient coins aims at
assigning a given coin to its issuer. Various issuers used various symbols for
their coins. We propose to use these symbols for a framework that will coarsely
classify the ancient coins. Bag of visual words (BoVWs) is a well established
visual recognition technique applied to various problems in computer vision
like object and scene recognition. Improvements have been made by incorporating
the spatial information to this technique. We apply the BoVWs technique to our
problem and use three symbols for coarse-grained classification. We use
rectangular tiling, log-polar tiling and circular tiling to incorporate spatial
information to BoVWs. Experimental results show that the circular tiling proves
superior to the rest of the methods for our problem.
