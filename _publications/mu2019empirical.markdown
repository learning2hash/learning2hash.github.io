In this paper, we compare the performances of FAISS and FENSHSES on nearest
neighbor search in Hamming space--a fundamental task with ubiquitous
applications in nowadays eCommerce. Comprehensive evaluations are made in terms
of indexing speed, search latency and RAM consumption. This comparison is
conducted towards a better understanding on trade-offs between nearest neighbor
search systems implemented in main memory and the ones implemented in secondary
memory, which is largely unaddressed in literature.
