<p>In this paper, we compare the performances of FAISS and FENSHSES on
nearest neighbor search in Hamming spaceâ€“a fundamental task with
ubiquitous applications in nowadays eCommerce. Comprehensive evaluations
are made in terms of indexing speed, search latency and RAM consumption.
This comparison is conducted towards a better understanding on
trade-offs between nearest neighbor search systems implemented in main
memory and the ones implemented in secondary memory, which is largely
unaddressed in literature.</p>
