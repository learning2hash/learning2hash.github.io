We explicitly determine all the relative generalized Hamming weights of
affine Cartesian codes using the notion of footprints and results from extremal
combinatorics. This generalizes the previous works on the determination of
relative generalized Hamming weights of Reed-Muller codes by Geil and Martin,
as well as the determination of all the generalized Hamming weights of the
affine Cartesian codes by Beelen and Datta.
