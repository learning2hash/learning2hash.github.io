Each signature \(\underline\{\lambda\}(n)=(\lambda_1(n),\dots,\lambda_n(n))\),
where \(\lambda_1(n)\geq\dots\geq\lambda_n(n)\) are integers, gives an
irreducible representation
\(\pi_\{\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\}:U(n)\rightarrow\text\{GL\}(V_\{\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\})\)
of the unitary group \(U(n)\). Suppose \(X\) is a finite-area cusped hyperbolic
surface, \(\chi\) is a random surface representation in
\(\text\{Hom\}(\pi_1(X),U(n))\) equipped with a Haar unitary probability measure,
and \((\underline\{\lambda\}(n))_\{n=1\}^\{\infty\}\) is a sequence of signatures. Let
\(|\underline\{\lambda\}(n)|:=\sum_i|\lambda_i(n)|\). We show that there is an
absolute constant \(c>0\) such that if \(0\neq |\underline\{\lambda\}(n)|\leq
c\frac\{log n\}\{loglog n\}\) for sufficiently large \(n\), then the Laplacians
\(\Delta_\{\chi,\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\}\) acting on sections of the flat unitary
bundles associated to the surface representations \[\pi_1(X)\xrightarrow\{\chi\}
U(n)\xrightarrow\{\pi_\{\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\}\}\text\{GL\}(V_\{\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\})\]
have the property that for every \(\epsilon>0\)
\[\mathbb\{P\}\left[\chi:\inf\text\{Spec\}(\Delta_\{\chi,\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\})\geq\frac\{1\}\{4\}-\epsilon\right]\xrightarrow\{n\rightarrow\infty\}1,\]
where \(\text\{Spec\}(\Delta_\{\chi,\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\})\) is the spectrum of
\(\Delta_\{\chi,\underline\{\lambda\}(n)\}\). A special case of this is that flat
unitary bundles associated to \(\chi:\pi_1(X)\rightarrow U(n)\) asymptotically
almost surely as \(n\rightarrow\infty\) have least eigenvalue at least
\(\frac\{1\}\{4\}-\epsilon\), irrespective of the spectral gap of \(X\) itself. This
is proved using the Hide--Magee method. Using the spectral theorem above and
proving a probabilistic prime geodesic theorem, we also obtain a probabilistic
equidistribution theorem for the images under \(\chi\) of geodesics of lengths
dependent on the rank \(n\).
