Proponents of the Distributed Morphology framework have posited the existence
of two levels of morphological word formation: a lower one, leading to loose
input-output semantic relationships; and an upper one, leading to tight
input-output semantic relationships. In this work, we propose to test the
validity of this assumption in the context of Hebrew word embeddings. If the
two-level hypothesis is borne out, we expect state-of-the-art Hebrew word
embeddings to encode (1) a noun, (2) a denominal derived from it (via an
upper-level operation), and (3) a verb related to the noun (via a lower-level
operation on the noun's root), in such a way that the denominal (2) should be
closer in the embedding space to the noun (1) than the related verb (3) is to
the same noun (1). We report that this hypothesis is verified by four embedding
models of Hebrew: fastText, GloVe, Word2Vec and AlephBERT. This suggests that
word embedding models are able to capture complex and fine-grained semantic
properties that are morphologically motivated.
