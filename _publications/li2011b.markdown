<p>In this paper, we propose to (seamlessly) integrate b-bit minwise
hashing with linear SVM to substantially improve the training (and
testing) efficiency using much smaller memory, with essentially no loss
of accuracy. Theoretically, we prove that the resemblance matrix, the
minwise hashing matrix, and the b-bit minwise hashing matrix are all
positive definite matrices (kernels). Interestingly, our proof for the
positive definiteness of the b-bit minwise hashing kernel naturally
suggests a simple strategy to integrate b-bit hashing with linear SVM.
Our technique is particularly useful when the data can not fit in
memory, which is an increasingly critical issue in large-scale machine
learning. Our preliminary experimental results on a publicly available
webspam dataset (350K samples and 16 million dimensions) verified the
effectiveness of our algorithm. For example, the training time was
reduced to merely a few seconds. In addition, our technique can be
easily extended to many other linear and nonlinear machine learning
applications such as logistic regression.</p>
