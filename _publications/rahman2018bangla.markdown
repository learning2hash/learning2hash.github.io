In the last few years, the deep learning technique in particular
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is using massively in the field of
computer vision and machine learning. This deep learning technique provides
state-of-the-art accuracy in different classification, segmentation, and
detection tasks on different benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Microsoft COCO, and ImageNet. However, there are a lot of research has been
conducted for Bangla License plate recognition with traditional machine
learning approaches in last decade. None of them are used to deploy a physical
system for Bangla License Plate Recognition System (BLPRS) due to their poor
recognition accuracy. In this paper, we have implemented CNNs based Bangla
license plate recognition system with better accuracy that can be applied for
different purposes including roadside assistance, automatic parking lot
management system, vehicle license status detection and so on. Along with that,
we have also created and released a very first and standard database for BLPRS.
