Image segmentation in RGB space is a notoriously difficult task where
state-of-the-art methods are trained on thousands or even millions of annotated
images. While the performance is impressive, it is still not perfect. We
propose a novel image segmentation method, achieving similar segmentation
quality but without training. Instead, we require an image sequence with a
static camera and a single light source at varying positions, as used in for
photometric stereo, for example.
