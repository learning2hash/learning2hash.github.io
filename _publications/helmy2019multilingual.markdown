This thesis presents a language-independent text classification model by
introduced two new encoding methods "BUNOW" and "BUNOC" used for feeding the
raw text data into a new CNN spatial architecture with vertical and horizontal
convolutional process instead of commonly used methods like one hot vector or
word representation (i.e. word2vec) with temporal CNN architecture. The
proposed model can be classified as hybrid word-character model in its work
methodology because it consumes less memory space by using a fewer neural
network parameters as in character level representation, in addition to
providing much faster computations with fewer network layers depth, as in word
level representation. A promising result achieved compared to state of art
models in two different morphological benchmarked dataset one for Arabic
language and one for English language.
