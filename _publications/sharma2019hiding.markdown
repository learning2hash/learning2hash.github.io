Steganography is an art of obscuring data inside another quotidian file of
similar or varying types. Hiding data has always been of significant importance
to digital forensics. Previously, steganography has been combined with
cryptography and neural networks separately. Whereas, this research combines
steganography, cryptography with the neural networks all together to hide an
image inside another container image of the larger or same size. Although the
cryptographic technique used is quite simple, but is effective when convoluted
with deep neural nets. Other steganography techniques involve hiding data
efficiently, but in a uniform pattern which makes it less secure. This method
targets both the challenges and make data hiding secure and non-uniform.
