The motivation for this study came from the task of analysing the kinetic
behavior of single molecules in a living cell based on Single Molecule
Localization Microscopy. Given measurements of both the motion of clusters and
molecules, the main task consists in detecting if a molecule belongs to a
cluster. While the exact size of the clusters is usually unknown, upper bounds
are available. In this study, we simulate the cluster movement by a Brownian
motion and those of the particles by a Gaussian mixture model with two modes
depending on the position of the particle within or outside a cluster. We
propose various variational models to detect if a particle lies within a
cluster based on the Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy distances between
measures. We compare the performance of the proposed models for simulated data.
