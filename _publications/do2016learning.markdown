This work proposes deep network models and learning algorithms for
unsupervised and supervised binary hashing. Our novel network design constrains
one hidden layer to directly output the binary codes. This addresses a
challenging issue in some previous works: optimizing non-smooth objective
functions due to binarization. Moreover, we incorporate independence and
balance properties in the direct and strict forms in the learning. Furthermore,
we include similarity preserving property in our objective function. Our
resulting optimization with these binary, independence, and balance constraints
is difficult to solve. We propose to attack it with alternating optimization
and careful relaxation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show
that our proposed methods compare favorably with the state of the art.
