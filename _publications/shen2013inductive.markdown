Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques in contrast are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high45;dimensional data. The complexity of these models and the problems with out45;of45;sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large45;scale embedding however. In this work we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above45;mentioned difficulties we describe an efficient inductive solution to the out45;of45;sample data problem and a process by which non45;parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t45;SNE .
