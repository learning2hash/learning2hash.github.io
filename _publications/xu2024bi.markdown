We propose a new "bi-metric" framework for designing nearest neighbor data
structures. Our framework assumes two dissimilarity functions: a ground-truth
metric that is accurate but expensive to compute, and a proxy metric that is
cheaper but less accurate. In both theory and practice, we show how to
construct data structures using only the proxy metric such that the query
procedure achieves the accuracy of the expensive metric, while only using a
limited number of calls to both metrics. Our theoretical results instantiate
this framework for two popular nearest neighbor search algorithms: DiskANN and
Cover Tree. In both cases we show that, as long as the proxy metric used to
construct the data structure approximates the ground-truth metric up to a
bounded factor, our data structure achieves arbitrarily good approximation
guarantees with respect to the ground-truth metric. On the empirical side, we
apply the framework to the text retrieval problem with two dissimilarity
functions evaluated by ML models with vastly different computational costs. We
observe that for almost all data sets in the MTEB benchmark, our approach
achieves a considerably better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff than the
alternatives, such as re-ranking.
