Modern financial institutions rely on data for many operations, including a
need to drive efficiency, enhance services and prevent financial crime. Data
sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid,
evidence-based decision making, including identifying money laundering and
fraud. However, data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing.
Privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow
organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory
compliance. This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean
a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or
external) party to identify people that hold an account in each dataset. We
observe that the names of account holders may be recorded differently in each
data set. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving approach for fuzzy name
matching across institutions, employing fully homomorphic encryption with
locality-sensitive hashing. The efficiency of the approach is enhanced using a
clustering mechanism. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed
approach are evaluated using different datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate it takes around 100 and 1000 seconds to search 1000 names from 10k
and 100k names, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach exhibits
significant improvement in reducing communication overhead by 30-300 times,
using clustering.
