With the rapid growth of various types of multimodal data cross45;modal deep hashing has received broad attention for solving cross45;modal retrieval problems efficiently. Most cross45;modal hashing methods follow the traditional supervised hashing framework in which the O(n^2) data pairs and O(n^3) data triplets are generated for training but the training procedure is less efficient because the complexity is high for large45;scale dataset. To address these issues we propose a novel and efficient cross45;modal hashing algorithm in which the unary loss is introduced. First of all We introduce the Cross45;Modal Unary Loss (CMUL) with O(n) complexity to bridge the traditional triplet loss and classification45;based unary loss. A more accurate bound of the triplet loss for structured multilabel data is also proposed in CMUL. Second we propose the novel Joint Cluster Cross45;Modal Hashing (JCCH) algorithm for efficient hash learning in which the CMUL is involved. The resultant hashcodes form several clusters in which the hashcodes in the same cluster share similar semantic information and the heterogeneity gap on different modalities is diminished by sharing the clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to be applied to various types of data and experiments on large45;scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior over or comparable with state45;of45;the45;art cross45;modal hashing methods and training with the proposed method is more efficient than others.
