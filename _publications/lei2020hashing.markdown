Locality45;Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular methods for c45;Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (c45;ANNS) in high45;dimensional spaces. In this paper we propose a novel LSH scheme based on the Longest Circular Co45;Substring (LCCS) search framework (LCCS45;LSH) with a theoretical guarantee. We introduce a novel concept of LCCS and a new data structure named Circular Shift Array (CSA) for k45;LCCS search. The insight of LCCS search framework is that close data objects will have a longer LCCS than the far45;apart ones with high probability. LCCS45;LSH is emph123;LSH45;family45;independent125; and it supports c45;ANNS with different kinds of distance metrics. We also introduce a multi45;probe version of LCCS45;LSH and conduct extensive experiments over five real45;life datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that LCCS45;LSH outperforms state45;of45;the45;art LSH schemes.
