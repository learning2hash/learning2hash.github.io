Automatic License Plate Recognition system is a challenging area of research
now-a-days and binarization is an integral and most important part of it. In
case of a real life scenario, most of existing methods fail to properly
binarize the image of a vehicle in a congested road, captured through a CCD
camera. In the current work we have applied histogram equalization technique
over the complete image and also over different hierarchy of image
partitioning. A novel scheme is formulated for giving the membership value to
each pixel for each hierarchy of histogram equalization. Then the image is
binarized depending on the net membership value of each pixel. The technique is
exhaustively evaluated on the vehicle image dataset as well as the license
plate dataset, giving satisfactory performances.
