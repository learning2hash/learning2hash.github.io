Basic algebraic and combinatorial properties of finite vector spaces in which
individual vectors are allowed to have multiplicities larger than \\( 1 \\) are
derived. An application in coding theory is illustrated by showing that
multispace codes that are introduced here may be used in random linear network
coding scenarios, and that they generalize standard subspace codes (defined in
the set of all subspaces of \\( \mathbb\{F\}_q^n \\)) and extend them to an
infinitely larger set of parameters. In particular, in contrast to subspace
codes, multispace codes of arbitrarily large cardinality and minimum distance
exist for any fixed \\( n \\) and \\( q \\).
