Stemming is the process of reducing related words to a standard form by
removing affixes from them. Existing algorithms vary with respect to their
complexity, configurability, handling of unknown words, and ability to avoid
under- and over-stemming. This paper presents a fast, simple, configurable,
high-precision, high-recall stemming algorithm that combines the simplicity and
performance of word-based lookup tables with the strong generalizability of
rule-based methods to avert problems with out-of-vocabulary words.
