This paper suggests the use of projective clustering based product quantization for improving nearest neighbor and max-inner-product vector search (MIPS) algorithms. We provide anisotropic and quantized variants of projective clustering which outperform previous clustering methods used for this problem such as ScaNN. We show that even with comparable running time complexity in terms of lookup-multiply-adds projective clustering produces more quantization centers resulting in more accurate dot-product estimates. We provide thorough experimentation to support our claims.
