We present a new, elementary proof of Boyd's interpolation theorem. Our
approach naturally yields a noncommutative version of this result and even
allows for the interpolation of certain operators on l^1-valued noncommutative
symmetric spaces. By duality we may interpolate several well-known
noncommutative maximal inequalities. In particular we obtain a version of
Doob's maximal inequality and the dual Doob inequality for noncommutative
symmetric spaces. We apply our results to prove the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy and
Burkholder-Rosenthal inequalities for noncommutative martingales in these
spaces.
