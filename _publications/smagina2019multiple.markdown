We present a collection of 24 multiple object scenes each recorded under 18
multiple light source illumination scenarios. The illuminants are varying in
dominant spectral colours, intensity and distance from the scene. We mainly
address the realistic scenarios for evaluation of computational colour
constancy algorithms, but also have aimed to make the data as general as
possible for computational colour science and computer vision. Along with the
images of the scenes, we provide spectral characteristics of the camera, light
sources and the objects and include pixel-by-pixel ground truth annotation of
uniformly coloured object surfaces thus making this useful for benchmarking
colour-based image segmentation algorithms. The dataset is freely available at
