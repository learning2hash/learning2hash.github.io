Egocentric vision aims to capture and analyse the world from the first-person
perspective. We explore the possibilities for egocentric wearable devices to
improve and enhance industrial use cases w.r.t. data collection, annotation,
labelling and downstream applications. This would contribute to easier data
collection and allow users to provide additional context. We envision that this
approach could serve as a supplement to the traditional industrial Machine
Vision workflow. Code, Dataset and related resources will be available at:
