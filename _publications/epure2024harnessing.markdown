Recommender systems relying on Language Models (LMs) have gained popularity
in assisting users to navigate large catalogs. LMs often exploit item
high-level descriptors, i.e. categories or consumption contexts, from training
data or user preferences. This has been proven effective in domains like movies
or products. However, in the music domain, understanding how effectively LMs
utilize song descriptors for natural language-based music recommendation is
relatively limited. In this paper, we assess LMs effectiveness in recommending
songs based on user natural language descriptions and items with descriptors
like genres, moods, and listening contexts. We formulate the recommendation
task as a dense retrieval problem and assess LMs as they become increasingly
familiar with data pertinent to the task and domain. Our findings reveal
improved performance as LMs are fine-tuned for general language similarity,
information retrieval, and mapping longer descriptions to shorter, high-level
descriptors in music.
