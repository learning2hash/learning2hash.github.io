A (tandem) duplication of length \( k \) is an insertion of an exact copy of a
substring of length \( k \) next to its original position. This and related types
of impairments are of relevance in modeling communication in the presence of
synchronization errors, as well as in several information storage applications.
We demonstrate that Levenshtein's construction of binary codes correcting
insertions of zeros is, with minor modifications, applicable also to channels
with arbitrary alphabets and with duplication errors of arbitrary (but fixed)
length \( k \). Furthermore, we derive bounds on the cardinality of optimal \( q
\)-ary codes correcting up to \( t \) duplications of length \( k \), and establish
the following corollaries in the asymptotic regime of growing block-length: 1.)
the presented family of codes is optimal for every \( q, t, k \), in the sense of
the asymptotic scaling of code redundancy; 2.) the upper bound, when
specialized to \( q = 2 \), \( k = 1 \), improves upon Levenshtein's bound for
every \( t \geq 3 \); 3.) the bounds coincide for \( t = 1 \), thus yielding the
exact asymptotic behavior of the size of optimal single-duplication-correcting
codes.
