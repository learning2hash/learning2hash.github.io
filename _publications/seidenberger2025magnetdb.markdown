BitTorrent remains a prominent channel for illicit distribution of
copyrighted material, yet the supply side of such content remains understudied.
We introduce MagnetDB, a longitudinal dataset of torrents discovered through
the BitTorrent DHT between 2018 and 2024, containing more than 28.6 million
torrents and metadata of more than 950 million files. While our primary focus
is on enabling research based on the supply of pirated movies and TV shows, the
dataset also encompasses other legitimate and illegitimate torrents. By
applying IMDb-matching and annotation to movie and TV show torrents, MagnetDB
facilitates detailed analyses of pirated content evolution in the BitTorrent
network. Researchers can leverage MagnetDB to examine distribution trends,
subcultural practices, and the gift economy within piracy ecosystems. Through
its scale and temporal scope, MagnetDB presents a unique opportunity for
investigating the broader dynamics of BitTorrent and advancing empirical
knowledge on digital piracy.
