Searching for similar logos in the registered logo database is a very
important and tedious task at the trademark office. Speed and accuracy are two
aspects that one must attend to while developing a system for retrieval of
logos. In this paper, we propose a rough-set based method to quantify the
structural information in a logo image that can be used to efficiently index an
image. A logo is split into a number of polygons, and for each polygon, we
compute the tight upper and lower approximations based on the principles of a
rough set. This representation is used for forming feature vectors for
retrieval of logos. Experimentation on a standard data set shows the usefulness
of the proposed technique. It is computationally efficient and also provides
retrieval results at high accuracy.
