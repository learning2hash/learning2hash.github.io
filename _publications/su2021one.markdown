One-shot learning is proposed to make a pretrained classifier workable on a
new dataset based on one labeled samples from each pattern. However, few of
researchers consider whether the dataset itself supports one-shot learning. In
this paper, we propose a set of definitions to explain what kind of datasets
can support one-shot learning and propose the concept "absolute
generalization". Based on these definitions, we proposed a method to build an
absolutely generalizable classifier. The proposed method concatenates two
samples as a new single sample, and converts a classification problem to an
identity identification problem or a similarity metric problem. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to baseline on one-shot
learning datasets and artificial datasets.
