Detecting and measuring repetitiveness of strings is a problem that has been
extensively studied in data compression and text indexing. However, when the
data are structured in a non-linear way, like in the context of two-dimensional
strings, inherent redundancy offers a rich source for compression, yet
systematic studies on repetitiveness measures are still lacking. In the paper
we introduce extensions of repetitiveness measures to general two-dimensional
strings. In particular, we propose a new extension of the measures \(\delta\) and
\(\gamma\), diverging from previous square based definitions proposed in
[Carfagna and Manzini, SPIRE 2023]. We further consider generalizations of
macro schemes and straight line programs for the 2D setting and show that, in
contrast to what happens on strings, 2D macro schemes and 2D SLPs can be both
asymptotically smaller than \(\delta\) and \(\gamma\). The results of the paper can
be easily extended to \(d\)-dimensional strings with \(d > 2\).
