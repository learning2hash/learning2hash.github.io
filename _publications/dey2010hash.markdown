In this paper we present an improved version of HF45;hash viz. GB45;hash Hash Functions Using Groebner Basis. In case of HF45;hash the compression function consists of 32 polynomials with 64 variables which were taken from the first 32 polynomials of hidden field equations challenge45;1 by forcing last 16 variables as 0. In GB45;hash we have designed the compression function in such way that these 32 polynomials with 64 variables form a minimal Groebner basis of the ideal generated by them with respect to graded lexicographical (grlex) ordering as well as with respect to graded reverse lexicographical (grevlex) ordering. In this paper we will prove that GB45;hash is more secure than HF45;hash as well as more secure than SHA45;256. We have also compared the efficiency of our GB45;hash with SHA45;256 and HF45;hash.
