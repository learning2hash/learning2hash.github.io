The music genre perception expressed through human annotations of artists or
albums varies significantly across language-bound cultures. These variations
cannot be modeled as mere translations since we also need to account for
cultural differences in the music genre perception. In this work, we study the
feasibility of obtaining relevant cross-lingual, culture-specific music genre
annotations based only on language-specific semantic representations, namely
distributed concept embeddings and ontologies. Our study, focused on six
languages, shows that unsupervised cross-lingual music genre annotation is
feasible with high accuracy, especially when combining both types of
representations. This approach of studying music genres is the most extensive
to date and has many implications in musicology and music information
retrieval. Besides, we introduce a new, domain-dependent cross-lingual corpus
to benchmark state of the art multilingual pre-trained embedding models.
