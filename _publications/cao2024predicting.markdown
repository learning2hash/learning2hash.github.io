Image captioning using Vision Transformers (ViTs) represents a pivotal
convergence of computer vision and natural language processing, offering the
potential to enhance user experiences, improve accessibility, and provide
textual representations of visual data. This paper explores the application of
image captioning techniques to New Yorker cartoons, aiming to generate captions
that emulate the wit and humor of winning entries in the New Yorker Cartoon
Caption Contest. This task necessitates sophisticated visual and linguistic
processing, along with an understanding of cultural nuances and humor. We
propose several new baselines for using vision transformer encoder-decoder
models to generate captions for the New Yorker cartoon caption contest.
