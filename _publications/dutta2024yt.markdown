YT-100K (randomly selected 100K sample from YT-30M) are publicly released for
further research. YT-30M (YT-100K) contains 32236173 (108694) comments posted
by YouTube channel that belong to YouTube categories. Each comment is

comment text, upvotes, original channel ID and category of the YouTube channel
