We generalise a multiple string pattern matching algorithm, recently proposed
by Fredriksson and Grabowski [J. Discr. Alg. 7, 2009], to deal with arbitrary
dictionaries on an alphabet of size \(s\). If \(r_m\) is the number of words of
length \(m\) in the dictionary, and \(\phi(r) = \max_m \ln(s\, m\, r_m)/m\), the
complexity rate for the string characters to be read by this algorithm is at
most \(\kappa_\{\{\}_\textrm\{UB\}\}\, \phi(r)\) for some constant
\(\kappa_\{\{\}_\textrm\{UB\}\}\). On the other side, we generalise the classical lower
bound of Yao [SIAM J. Comput. 8, 1979], for the problem with a single pattern,
to deal with arbitrary dictionaries, and determine it to be at least
\(\kappa_\{\{\}_\textrm\{LB\}\}\, \phi(r)\). This proves the optimality of the
algorithm, improving and correcting previous claims.
