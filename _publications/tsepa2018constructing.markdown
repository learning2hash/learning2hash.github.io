The problem of unsupervised learning node embeddings in graphs is one of the
important directions in modern network science. In this work we propose a novel
framework, which is aimed to find embeddings by \textit\{discriminating
distributions of similarities (DDoS)\} between nodes in the graph. The general
idea is implemented by maximizing the \textit\{earth mover distance\} between
distributions of decoded similarities of similar and dissimilar nodes. The
resulting algorithm generates embeddings which give a state-of-the-art
performance in the problem of link prediction in real-world graphs.
