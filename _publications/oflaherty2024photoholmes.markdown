In this paper, we introduce PhotoHolmes, an open-source Python library
designed to easily run and benchmark forgery detection methods on digital
images. The library includes implementations of popular and state-of-the-art
methods, dataset integration tools, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing the
Benchmark tool in PhotoHolmes, users can effortlessly compare various methods.
This facilitates an accurate and reproducible comparison between their own
methods and those in the existing literature. Furthermore, PhotoHolmes includes
a command-line interface (CLI) to easily run the methods implemented in the
library on any suspicious image. As such, image forgery methods become more
accessible to the community. The library has been built with extensibility and
modularity in mind, which makes adding new methods, datasets and metrics to the
library a straightforward process. The source code is available at
