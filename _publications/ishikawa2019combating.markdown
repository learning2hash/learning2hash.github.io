Watching cartoons can be useful for children's intellectual, social and
emotional development. However, the most popular video sharing platform today
provides many videos with Elsagate content. Elsagate is a phenomenon that
depicts childhood characters in disturbing circumstances (e.g., gore, toilet
humor, drinking urine, stealing). Even with this threat easily available for
children, there is no work in the literature addressing the problem. As the
first to explore disturbing content in cartoons, we proceed from the most
recent pornography detection literature applying deep convolutional neural
networks combined with static and motion information of the video. Our solution
is compatible with mobile platforms and achieved 92.6% of accuracy. Our goal is
not only to introduce the first solution but also to bring up the discussion
around Elsagate.
