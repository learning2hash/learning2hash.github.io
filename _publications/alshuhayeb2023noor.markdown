There are numerous complex and rich morphological features in the Arabic
language, which are highly useful when analyzing traditional Arabic textbooks,
especially in the literary and religious contexts, and help in understanding
the meaning of the textbooks. Vocabulary separation means separating the word
into different components, such as the root and affixes. In the morphological
datasets, the variety of markers and the number of data samples help to
evaluate the morphological techniques. In this paper, we present a standard
dataset for analyzing the Arabic segmentation tools, which includes
approximately 223,690 words from the "Shariat al-Islam" book, labeled by human
experts. In terms of volume and word variety, this dataset is superior to the
other Hadith Arabic datasets, to the best of our knowledge. To estimate the
dataset, we applied different methods, including Farasa, Camel, and ALP, and
reported the annotation quality and analyzed the benchmark specifications as
well. This be
