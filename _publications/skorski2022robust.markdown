In this work, we improve upon the guarantees for sparse random embeddings, as
they were recently provided and analyzed by Freksen at al. (NIPS'18) and
Jagadeesan (NIPS'19). Specifically, we show that (a) our bounds are explicit as
opposed to the asymptotic guarantees provided previously, and (b) our bounds
are guaranteed to be sharper by practically significant constants across a wide
range of parameters, including the dimensionality, sparsity and dispersion of
the data. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that our bounds significantly
outperform prior works on a wide range of real-world datasets, such as
collections of images, text documents represented as bags-of-words, and text
sequences vectorized by neural embeddings. Behind our numerical improvements
are techniques of broader interest, which improve upon key steps of previous
analyses in terms of (c) tighter estimates for certain types of quadratic
chaos, (d) establishing extreme properties of sparse linear forms, and (e)
improvements on bounds for the estimation of sums of independent random
variables.
