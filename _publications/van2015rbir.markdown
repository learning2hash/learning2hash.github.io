This paper approaches the image retrieval system on the base of visual features
local region RBIR (region-based image retrieval). First of all, the paper
presents a method for extracting the interest points based on Harris-Laplace to
create the feature region of the image. Next, in order to reduce the storage
space and speed up query image, the paper builds the binary signature structure
to describe the visual content of image. Based on the image's binary signature,
the paper builds the SG (signature graph) to classify and store image's binary
signatures. Since then, the paper builds the image retrieval algorithm on SG
through the similar measure EMD (earth mover's distance) between the image's
binary signatures. Last but not least, the paper gives an image retrieval model
RBIR, experiments and assesses the image retrieval method on Corel image
database over 10,000 images.
