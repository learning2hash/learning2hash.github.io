We study the problem of approximating Hamming distance in sublinear time
under property-preserving hashing (PPH), where only hashed representations of
inputs are available. Building on the threshold evaluation framework of
Fleischhacker, Larsen, and Simkin (EUROCRYPT 2022), we present a sequence of
constructions with progressively improved complexity: a baseline binary search
algorithm, a refined variant with constant repetition per query, and a novel
hash design that enables constant-time approximation without oracle access. Our
results demonstrate that approximate distance recovery is possible under strong
cryptographic guarantees, bridging efficiency and security in similarity
estimation.
