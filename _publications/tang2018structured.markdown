We propose a computationally efficient and high-performance classification
algorithm by incorporating class structural information in analysis dictionary
learning. To achieve more consistent classification, we associate a class
characteristic structure of independent subspaces and impose it on the
classification error constrained analysis dictionary learning. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves a comparable or better performance than
the state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of visual classification tasks. In
addition, our method greatly reduces the training and testing computational
complexity.
