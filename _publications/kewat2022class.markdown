Recently some mixed alphabet rings are involved in constructing few-Lee
weight additive codes with optimal or minimal Gray images using suitable
defining sets or down-sets. Inspired by these works, we choose the mixed
alphabet ring \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2\mathbb\{Z\}_2[u]\) to construct a special class of
linear code \(C_L\) over \(\mathbb\{Z\}_2[u]\) with \(u^2=0\) by employing simplicial
complexes generated by a single maximal element. We show that \(C_L\) has few-Lee
weights by determining the Lee weight distribution of \(C_L\). Theoretically,
this shows that we may employ simplicial complexes to obatin few-weight codes
even in the case of mixed alphabet rings. We show that the Gray image of \(C_L\)
is self-orthogonal and we have an infinite family of minimal codes over
\(\mathbb\{Z\}_2\) via Gray map, which can be used to secret sharing schemes.
