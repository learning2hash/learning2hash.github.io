A novel compression scheme for compressing the outcome of \(n\) independent
Bernoulli trials is introduced and analysed. The resulting algorithm,
BernoulliZip, is a fast and near-optimal method to produce prefix codes for a
Bernoulli process. BernoulliZip's main principle is to first represent the
number of 1s in the sequence and then specify the sequence. The application of
BernoulliZip on compressing Erdos-Renyi graphs is explored.
