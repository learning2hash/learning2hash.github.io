This paper demonstrates the feasibility of learning to retrieve short
snippets of sheet music (images) when given a short query excerpt of music
(audio) -- and vice versa --, without any symbolic representation of music or
scores. This would be highly useful in many content-based musical retrieval
scenarios. Our approach is based on Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA)
and learns correlated latent spaces allowing for cross-modality retrieval in
both directions. Initial experiments with relatively simple monophonic music
show promising results.
