A Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph is a type of graph construction using
shared nearest neighbor information, which is a secondary similarity measure
based on the rankings induced by a primary \(k\)-nearest neighbor (\(k\)-NN)
measure. SNN measures have been touted as being less prone to the curse of
dimensionality than conventional distance measures, and thus methods using SNN
graphs have been widely used in applications, particularly in clustering
high-dimensional data sets and in finding outliers in subspaces of high
dimensional data. Despite this, the theoretical study of SNN graphs and graph
Laplacians remains unexplored. In this pioneering work, we make the first
contribution in this direction. We show that large scale asymptotics of an SNN
graph Laplacian reach a consistent continuum limit; this limit is the same as
that of a \(k\)-NN graph Laplacian. Moreover, we show that the pointwise
convergence rate of the graph Laplacian is linear with respect to \((k/n)^\{1/m\}\)
with high probability.
