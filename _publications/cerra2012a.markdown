Compression-based similarity measures are effectively employed in applications
on diverse data types with a basically parameter-free approach. Nevertheless,
there are problems in applying these techniques to medium-to-large datasets
which have been seldom addressed. This paper proposes a similarity measure based
on compression with dictionaries, the Fast Compression Distance (FCD), which
reduces the complexity of these methods, without degradations in performance. On
its basis a content-based color image retrieval system is defined, which can be
compared to state-of-the-art methods based on invariant color features. Through
the FCD a better understanding of compression-based techniques is achieved, by
performing experiments on datasets which are larger than the ones analyzed so
far in literature.
