We consider the random interlacements process with intensity \\(u\\) on \\(\{\mathbb
Z\}^d\\), \\(d\ge 5\\) (call it \\(I^u\\)), built from a Poisson point process on the
space of doubly infinite nearest neighbor trajectories on \\(\{\mathbb Z\}^d\\). For
\\(k\ge 3\\) we want to determine the minimal number of trajectories from the point
process that is needed to link together \\(k\\) points in \\(\mathcal I^u\\). Let
$\\(n(k,d):=\lceil \frac d 2 (k-1) \rceil - (k-2).\\)\\( We prove that almost surely
given any \\)k\\( points \\)x_1,...,x_k\in \mathcal I^u\\(, there is a sequence ofof
\\)n(k,d)\\( trajectories \\)\gamma^1,...,\gamma^\{n(k,d)\}\\( from the underlying
Poisson point process such that the union of their traces
\\)\bigcup_\{i=1\}^\{n(k,d)\}\tr(\gamma^\{i\})\\( is a connected set containing
\\)x_1,...,x_k\\(. Moreover we show that this result is sharp, i.e. that a.s. one
can find \\)x_1,...,x_k in I^u\\( that cannot be linked together by \\)n(k,d)-1$
trajectories.
