Binary embedding of high45;dimensional data aims to produce low45;dimensional binary codes while preserving discriminative power. State45;of45;the45;art methods often suffer from high computation and storage costs. We present a simple and fast embedding scheme by first downsampling N45;dimensional data into M45;dimensional data and then multiplying the data with an MxM circulant matrix. Our method requires O(N +M log M) computation and O(N) storage costs. We prove if data have sparsity our scheme can achieve similarity45;preserving well. Experiments further demonstrate that though our method is cost45;effective and fast it still achieves comparable performance in image applications.
