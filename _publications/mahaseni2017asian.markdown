In this paper, we address the problem of stamp recognition. The goal is to
classify a given stamp to a certain country and also identify the year it is
published. We propose a new approach for stamp recognition based on describing
a given stamp image using color information and texture information. For color
information we use color histogram for the entire image and for texture we use
two features. SIFT which is based on local feature descriptors and HOG which is
a dens texture descriptor. As a result on total we have three different types
of features. Our initial evaluation shows that give these information we are
able to classify the images with a reasonable accuracy.
