A lot of work has been done in the field of image compression via machine
learning, but not much attention has been given to the compression of natural
language. Compressing text into lossless representations while making features
easily retrievable is not a trivial task, yet has huge benefits. Most methods
designed to produce feature rich sentence embeddings focus solely on performing
well on downstream tasks and are unable to properly reconstruct the original
sequence from the learned embedding. In this work, we propose a near lossless
method for encoding long sequences of texts as well as all of their
sub-sequences into feature rich representations. We test our method on
sentiment analysis and show good performance across all sub-sentence and
sentence embeddings.
