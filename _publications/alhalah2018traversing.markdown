We introduce the first work to tackle the image retrieval problem as a
continuous operation. While the proposed approaches in the literature can be
roughly categorized into two main groups: category- and instance-based
retrieval, in this work we show that the retrieval task is much richer and more
complex. Image similarity goes beyond this discrete vantage point and spans a
continuous spectrum among the classical operating points of category and
instance similarity. However, current retrieval models are static and incapable
of exploring this rich structure of the retrieval space since they are trained
and evaluated with a single operating point as a target objective. Hence, we
introduce a novel retrieval model that for a given query is capable of
producing a dynamic embedding that can target an arbitrary point along the
continuous retrieval spectrum. Our model disentangles the visual signal of a
query image into its basic components of categorical and attribute information.
Furthermore, using a continuous control parameter our model learns to
reconstruct a dynamic embedding of the query by mixing these components with
different proportions to target a specific point along the retrieval simplex.
We demonstrate our idea in a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model and
highlight the advantages of our approach against a set of well-established
discrete retrieval models.
