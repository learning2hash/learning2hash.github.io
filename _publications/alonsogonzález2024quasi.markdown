A flag is a sequence of nested subspaces of a given ambient space F_q^n over
a finite field F_q. In network coding, a flag code is a set of flags, all of
them with the same sequence of dimensions, the type vector. In this paper, we
investigate quasi-optimum distance flag codes, i.e., those attaining the second
best possible distance value. We characterize them and present upper bounds for
their cardinality. Moreover, we propose a systematic construction for every
choice of the type vector by using partial spreads and sunflowers. For flag
codes with lower minimum distance, we adapt the previous construction and
provide some results towards their characterization, especially in the case of
the third best possible distance value.
