Recent advances in visual recognition indicate that to
achieve good retrieval and classification accuracy on largescale
datasets like ImageNet, extremely high-dimensional
visual descriptors, e.g., Fisher Vectors, are needed. We
present a novel method for converting such descriptors to
compact similarity-preserving binary codes that exploits
their natural matrix structure to reduce their dimensionality
using compact bilinear projections instead of a single
large projection matrix. This method achieves comparable
retrieval and classification accuracy to the original descriptors
and to the state-of-the-art Product Quantization
approach while having orders of magnitude faster code generation
time and smaller memory footprint.
