An end-to-end trainable (fully differentiable) method for multi-language
scene text localization and recognition is proposed. The approach is based on a
single fully convolutional network (FCN) with shared layers for both tasks.
  E2E-MLT is the first published multi-language OCR for scene text. While
trained in multi-language setup, E2E-MLT demonstrates competitive performance
when compared to other methods trained for English scene text alone. The
experiments show that obtaining accurate multi-language multi-script
annotations is a challenging problem.
