In this analysis, we work with the data set that was compiled by Darren
Linvill and Patrick Warren, along with a representative sample of Facebook ads
that were released by the House Intelligence Committee Minority. The goal of
this analysis is to use the categories defined by Linvill and Warren in the
Twitter data and investigate if these categories exist in Facebook ads. This
begin to give us insights to the tactics used between the two social media
services. Further, we try to replicate Linvill and Warren's original
categorization of the Twitter data. Lastly, we investigate what categories may
exist in the Facebook data.
