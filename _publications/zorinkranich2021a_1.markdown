Let \(f\) be a martingale with values in a uniformly \(p\)-smooth Banach space
and \(w\) any positive weight. We show that \(\mathbb\{E\} (f^* \cdot w) \lesssim
\mathbb\{E\}(S_p f \cdot w^*)\), where \(\cdot^*\) is the martingale maximal
operator and \(S_p\) is the \(\ell^p\) sum of martingale increments.
