We derive upper and lower bounds on the sum of distances of a spherical code
of size \(N\) in \(n\) dimensions when \(N\sim n^\alpha, 0<\alpha\le 2.\) The bounds
are derived by specializing recent general, universal bounds on energy of
spherical sets. We discuss asymptotic behavior of our bounds along with several
examples of codes whose sum of distances closely follows the upper bound.
