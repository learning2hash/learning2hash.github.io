Semantic Web technology has successfully facilitated many RDF models with
rich data representation methods. It also has the potential ability to
represent and store multimodal knowledge bases such as multimodal scene graphs.
However, most existing query languages, especially SPARQL, barely explore the
implicit multimodal relationships like semantic similarity, spatial relations,
etc. We first explored this issue by organizing a large-scale scene graph
dataset, namely Visual Genome, in the RDF graph database. Based on the proposed
RDF-stored multimodal scene graph, we extended SPARQL queries to answer
questions containing relational reasoning about color, spatial, etc. Further
demo (i.e., VGStore) shows the effectiveness of customized queries and
displaying multimodal data.
