This paper introduces a new kernel-based classifier by viewing kernel
matrices as generalized graphs and leveraging recent progress in graph
embedding techniques. The proposed method facilitates fast and scalable kernel
matrix embedding, and seamlessly integrates multiple kernels to enhance the
learning process. Our theoretical analysis offers a population-level
characterization of this approach using random variables. Empirically, our
method demonstrates superior running time compared to standard approaches such
as support vector machines and two-layer neural network, while achieving
comparable classification accuracy across various simulated and real datasets.
