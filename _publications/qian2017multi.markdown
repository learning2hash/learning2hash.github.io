Person Re-identification (re-id) aims to match people across non-overlapping
camera views in a public space. It is a challenging problem because many people
captured in surveillance videos wear similar clothes. Consequently, the
differences in their appearance are often subtle and only detectable at the
right location and scales. Existing re-id models, particularly the recently
proposed deep learning based ones match people at a single scale. In contrast,
in this paper, a novel multi-scale deep learning model is proposed. Our model
is able to learn deep discriminative feature representations at different
scales and automatically determine the most suitable scales for matching. The
importance of different spatial locations for extracting discriminative
features is also learned explicitly. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate
that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the art on a number of
benchmarks
