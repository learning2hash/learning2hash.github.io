The study of Ukiyo-e, an important genre of pre-modern Japanese art, focuses
on the object and style like other artwork researches. Such study has benefited
from the renewed interest by the machine learning community in culturally
important topics, leading to interdisciplinary works including collections of
images, quantitative approaches, and machine learning-based creativities. They,
however, have several drawbacks, and it remains challenging to integrate these
works into a comprehensive view. To bridge this gap, we propose a holistic
approach We first present a large-scale Ukiyo-e dataset with coherent semantic
labels and geometric annotations, then show its value in a quantitative study
of Ukiyo-e paintings' object using these labels and annotations. We further
demonstrate the machine learning methods could help style study through soft
color decomposition of Ukiyo-e, and finally provides joint insights into object
and style by composing sketches and colors using colorization. Dataset
