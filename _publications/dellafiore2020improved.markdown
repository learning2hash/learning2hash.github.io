For fixed integers \\(b\geq k\\), a problem of relevant interest in computer
science and combinatorics is that of determining the asymptotic growth, with
\\(n\\), of the largest set for which a \\((b, k)\\)-hash family of \\(n\\) functions
exists. Equivalently, determining the asymptotic growth of a largest subset of
\\(\\{1,2,\ldots,b\\}^n\\) such that, for any \\(k\\) distinct elements in the set, there
is a coordinate where they all differ.
  An important asymptotic upper bound for general \\(b, k\\), was derived by
Fredman and Koml\'os in the '80s and improved for certain \\(b\neq k\\) by K\"orner
and Marton and by Arikan. Only very recently better bounds were derived for the
general \\(b,k\\) case by Guruswami and Riazanov while stronger results for small
values of \\(b=k\\) were obtained by Arikan, by Dalai, Guruswami and Radhakrishnan
and by Costa and Dalai. In this paper, we both show how some of the latter
results extend to \\(b\neq k\\) and further strengthen the bounds for some specific
small values of \\(b\\) and \\(k\\). The method we use, which depends on the reduction
of an optimization problem to a finite number of cases, shows that further
results might be obtained by refined arguments at the expense of higher
complexity which could be reduced by using more sophisticated and optimized
algorithmic approaches.
