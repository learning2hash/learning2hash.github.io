<p>For fixed integers <span class="math inline">\(b\geq k\)</span>, a
problem of relevant interest in computer science and combinatorics is
that of determining the asymptotic growth, with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of the largest set for which a <span
class="math inline">\((b, k)\)</span>-hash family of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> functions exists. Equivalently,
determining the asymptotic growth of a largest subset of <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\ldots,b\}^n\)</span> such that, for any
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> distinct elements in the set,
there is a coordinate where they all differ. An important asymptotic
upper bound for general <span class="math inline">\(b, k\)</span>, was
derived by Fredman and Koml'os in the â€™80s and improved for certain
<span class="math inline">\(b\neq k\)</span> by K"orner and Marton and
by Arikan. Only very recently better bounds were derived for the general
<span class="math inline">\(b,k\)</span> case by Guruswami and Riazanov
while stronger results for small values of <span
class="math inline">\(b=k\)</span> were obtained by Arikan, by Dalai,
Guruswami and Radhakrishnan and by Costa and Dalai. In this paper, we
both show how some of the latter results extend to <span
class="math inline">\(b\neq k\)</span> and further strengthen the bounds
for some specific small values of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The method we use, which
depends on the reduction of an optimization problem to a finite number
of cases, shows that further results might be obtained by refined
arguments at the expense of higher complexity which could be reduced by
using more sophisticated and optimized algorithmic approaches.</p>
