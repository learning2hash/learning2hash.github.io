Learning embedding functions, which map semantically related inputs to nearby
locations in a feature space supports a variety of classification and
information retrieval tasks. In this work, we propose a novel, generalizable
and fast method to define a family of embedding functions that can be used as
an ensemble to give improved results. Each embedding function is learned by
randomly bagging the training labels into small subsets. We show experimentally
that these embedding ensembles create effective embedding functions. The
ensemble output defines a metric space that improves state of the art
performance for image retrieval on CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, In-Shop Clothes
Retrieval and VehicleID.
