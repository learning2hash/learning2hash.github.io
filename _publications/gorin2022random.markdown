A sorting network is a shortest path from \\(12\dots n\\) to \\(n\dots 21\\) in the
Cayley graph of the symmetric group \\(\mathfrak S_n\\) spanned by adjacent
transpositions. The paper computes the edge local limit of the uniformly random
sorting networks as \\(n\to\infty\\). We find the asymptotic distribution of the
first occurrence of a given swap \\((k,k+1)\\) and identify it with the law of the
smallest positive eigenvalue of a \\(2k\times 2k\\) aGUE (an aGUE matrix has purely
imaginary Gaussian entries that are independently distributed subject to
skew-symmetry). Next, we give two different formal definitions of a spacing --
the time distance between the occurrence of a given swap \\((k,k+1)\\) in a
uniformly random sorting network. Two definitions lead to two different
expressions for the asymptotic laws expressed in terms of derivatives of
Fredholm determinants.
