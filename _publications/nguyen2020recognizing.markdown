Kinship verification and kinship retrieval are emerging tasks in computer
vision. Kinship verification aims at determining whether two facial images are
from related people or not, while kinship retrieval is the task of retrieving
possible related facial images to a person from a gallery of images. They
introduce unique challenges because of the hidden relations and features that
carry inherent characteristics between the facial images. We employ 3 methods,
FaceNet, Siamese VGG-Face, and a combination of FaceNet and VGG-Face models as
feature extractors, to achieve the 9th standing for kinship verification and
the 5th standing for kinship retrieval in the Recognizing Family in The Wild
2020 competition. We then further experimented using StyleGAN2 as another
encoder, with no improvement in the result.
