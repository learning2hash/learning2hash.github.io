The PageRank of a graph is a scalar function defined on the node set of the
graph which encodes nodes centrality information of the graph. In this article,
we use the PageRank function along with persistent homology to obtain a
scalable graph descriptor and utilize it to compare the similarities between
graphs. For a given graph \(G(V,E)\), our descriptor can be computed in
\(O(|E|\alpha(|V|))\), where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function which
makes it scalable and computable on massive graphs. We show the effectiveness
of our method by utilizing it on multiple shape mesh datasets.
