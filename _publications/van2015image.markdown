In this paper, we introduce an optimum approach for querying similar images on
large digital-image databases. Our work is based on RBIR (region-based image
retrieval) method which uses multiple regions as the key to retrieval images.
This method significantly improves the accuracy of queries. However, this also
increases the cost of computing. To reduce this expensive computational cost, we
implement binary signature encoder which maps an image to its identification in
binary. In order to fasten the lookup, binary signatures of images are
classified by the help of S-kGraph. Finally, our work is evaluated on COREL's
images.
