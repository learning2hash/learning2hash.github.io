In this paper we introduce an optimum approach for querying similar images on large digital45;image databases. Our work is based on RBIR (region45;based image retrieval) method which uses multiple regions as the key to retrieval images. This method significantly improves the accuracy of queries. However this also increases the cost of computing. To reduce this expensive computational cost we implement binary signature encoder which maps an image to its identification in binary. In order to fasten the lookup binary signatures of images are classified by the help of S45;kGraph. Finally our work is evaluated on CORELs images.
