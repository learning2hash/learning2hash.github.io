This paper provides a method for indexing and retrieving Arabic texts, based
on natural language processing. Our approach exploits the notion of template in
word stemming and replaces the words by their stems. This technique has proven
to be effective since it has returned significant relevant retrieval results by
decreasing silence during the retrieval phase. Series of experiments have been
conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm ESAIR (Enhanced
Stemmer for Arabic Information Retrieval). The results obtained indicate that
the algorithm extracts the exact root with an accuracy rate up to 96% and
hence, improving information retrieval.
