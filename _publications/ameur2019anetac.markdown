In this paper, we make freely accessible ANETAC our English-Arabic named
entity transliteration and classification dataset that we built from freely
available parallel translation corpora. The dataset contains 79,924 instances,
each instance is a triplet (e, a, c), where e is the English named entity, a is
its Arabic transliteration and c is its class that can be either a Person, a
Location, or an Organization. The ANETAC dataset is mainly aimed for the
researchers that are working on Arabic named entity transliteration, but it can
also be used for named entity classification purposes.
