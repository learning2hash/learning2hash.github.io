In this paper we make freely accessible ANETAC our English-Arabic named entity transliteration and classification dataset that we built from freely available parallel translation corpora. The dataset contains 79924 instances each instance is a triplet (e a c) where e is the English named entity a is its Arabic transliteration and c is its class that can be either a Person a Location or an Organization. The ANETAC dataset is mainly aimed for the researchers that are working on Arabic named entity transliteration but it can also be used for named entity classification purposes.
