The simplicity and expressiveness of a histogram render it a useful feature
in different contexts including deep learning. Although the process of
computing a histogram is non-differentiable, researchers have proposed
differentiable approximations, which have some limitations. A differentiable
histogram that directly approximates the hard-binning operation in conventional
histograms is proposed. It combines the strength of existing differentiable
histograms and overcomes their individual challenges. In comparison to a
histogram computed using Numpy, the proposed histogram has an absolute
approximation error of 0.000158.
