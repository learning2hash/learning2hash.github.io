In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller
codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. We propose a
polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices,
works on any such code and corrects up to half the minimum distance.
