A picture is worth a thousand words. Not until recently, however, we noticed
some success stories in understanding of visual scenes: a model that is able to
detect/name objects, describe their attributes, and recognize their
relationships/interactions. In this paper, we propose a phrase-based
hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory (phi-LSTM) model to generate image
description. The proposed model encodes sentence as a sequence of combination
of phrases and words, instead of a sequence of words alone as in those
conventional solutions. The two levels of this model are dedicated to i) learn
to generate image relevant noun phrases, and ii) produce appropriate image
description from the phrases and other words in the corpus. Adopting a
convolutional neural network to learn image features and the LSTM to learn the
word sequence in a sentence, the proposed model has shown better or competitive
results in comparison to the state-of-the-art models on Flickr8k and Flickr30k
datasets.
