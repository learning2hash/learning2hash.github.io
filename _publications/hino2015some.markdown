We confirm, in a more general framework, a part of the conjecture posed by R.
Bell, C.-W. Ho, and R. S. Strichartz [Energy measures of harmonic functions on
the Sierpi\'nski gasket, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 63 (2014), 831--868] on the
distribution of energy measures for the canonical Dirichlet form on the
two-dimensional standard Sierpinski gasket.
