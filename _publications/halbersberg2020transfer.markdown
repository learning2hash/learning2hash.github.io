Estimation of photometric plant phenotypes (e.g., hue, shine, chroma) in
field conditions is important for decisions on the expected yield quality,
fruit ripeness, and need for further breeding. Estimating these from images is
difficult due to large variances in lighting conditions, shadows, and sensor
properties. We combine the image and metadata regarding capturing conditions
embedded into a network, enabling more accurate estimation and transfer between
different conditions. Compared to a state-of-the-art deep CNN and a human
expert, metadata embedding improves the estimation of the tomato's hue and
chroma.
