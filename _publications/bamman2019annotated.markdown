We present in this work a new dataset of coreference annotations for works of
literature in English, covering 29,103 mentions in 210,532 tokens from 100
works of fiction. This dataset differs from previous coreference datasets in
containing documents whose average length (2,105.3 words) is four times longer
than other benchmark datasets (463.7 for OntoNotes), and contains examples of
difficult coreference problems common in literature. This dataset allows for an
evaluation of cross-domain performance for the task of coreference resolution,
and analysis into the characteristics of long-distance within-document
coreference.
