The Universal Similarity Metric (USM) has been demonstrated to give
practically useful measures of "similarity" between sequence data. Here we have
used the USM as an alternative distance metric in a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN)
learner to allow effective pattern recognition of variable length sequence
data. We compare this USM approach with the commonly used string-to-word vector
approach. Our experiments have used two data sets of divergent domains: (1)
spam email filtering and (2) protein subcellular localization. Our results with
this data reveal that the USM-based K-NN learner (1) gives predictions with
higher classification accuracy than those output by techniques that use the
string-to-word vector approach, and (2) can be used to generate reliable
probability forecasts.
