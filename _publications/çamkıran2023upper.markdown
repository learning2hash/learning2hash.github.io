A classical statistical inequality is used to show that the distance
covariance of two bounded random vectors is bounded from above by a simple
function of the dimensionality and the bounds of the random vectors. Two
special cases that further simplify the result are considered: one in which
both random vectors have the same number of components, each component taking
values in an interval of unit length, and the other in which both random
vectors have one component.
