Thomassen characterized some 1-plane embedding as the forbidden configuration
such that a given 1-plane embedding of a graph is drawable in straight-lines if
and only if it does not contain the configuration [C. Thomassen, Rectilinear
drawings of graphs, J. Graph Theory, 10(3), 335-341, 1988].
  In this paper, we characterize some 1-plane embedding as the forbidden
configuration such that a given 1-plane embedding of a graph can be re-embedded
into a straight-line drawable 1-plane embedding of the same graph if and only
if it does not contain the configuration. Re-embedding of a 1-plane embedding
preserves the same set of pairs of crossing edges.
  We give a linear-time algorithm for finding a straight-line drawable 1-plane
re-embedding or the forbidden configuration.
