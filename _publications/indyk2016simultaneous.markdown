Motivated by applications in computer vision and databases, we introduce and
study the Simultaneous Nearest Neighbor Search (SNN) problem. Given a set of
data points, the goal of SNN is to design a data structure that, given a
collection of queries, finds a collection of close points that are compatible
with each other. Formally, we are given \\(k\\) query points \\(Q=q_1,\cdots,q_k\\),
and a compatibility graph \\(G\\) with vertices in \\(Q\\), and the goal is to return
data points \\(p_1,\cdots,p_k\\) that minimize (i) the weighted sum of the
distances from \\(q_i\\) to \\(p_i\\) and (ii) the weighted sum, over all edges \\((i,j)\\)
in the compatibility graph \\(G\\), of the distances between \\(p_i\\) and \\(p_j\\). The
problem has several applications, where one wants to return a set of consistent
answers to multiple related queries. This generalizes well-studied
computational problems, including NN, Aggregate NN and the 0-extension problem.
  In this paper we propose and analyze the following general two-step method
for designing efficient data structures for SNN. In the first step, for each
query point \\(q_i\\) we find its (approximate) nearest neighbor point \\(\hat\{p\}_i\\);
this can be done efficiently using existing approximate nearest neighbor
structures. In the second step, we solve an off-line optimization problem over
sets \\(q_1,\cdots,q_k\\) and \\(\hat\{p\}_1,\cdots,\hat\{p\}_k\\); this can be done
efficiently given that \\(k\\) is much smaller than \\(n\\). Even though
\\(\hat\{p\}_1,\cdots,\hat\{p\}_k\\) might not constitute the optimal answers to
queries \\(q_1,\cdots,q_k\\), we show that, for the unweighted case, the resulting
algorithm is \\(O(log k/log log k)\\)-approximation. Also, we show that the
approximation factor can be in fact reduced to a constant for compatibility
graphs frequently occurring in practice.
  Finally, we show that the "empirical approximation factor" provided by the
above approach is very close to 1.
