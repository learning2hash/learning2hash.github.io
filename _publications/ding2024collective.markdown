Nearest neighbor search methods based on hashing have attracted considerable attention for effective and efficient large-scale similarity search in computer vision and information retrieval community. In this paper we study the problems of learning hash functions in the context of multimodal data for cross-view similarity search. We put forward a novel hashing method which is referred to Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (CMFH). CMFH learns unified hash codes by collective matrix factorization with latent factor model from different modalities of one instance which can not only supports cross-view search but also increases the search accuracy by merging multiple view information sources. We also prove that CMFH a similaritypreserving hashing learning method has upper and lower boundaries. Extensive experiments verify that CMFH significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on three different datasets.
