In this paper, we describe the LIDIOMS data set, a multilingual RDF
representation of idioms currently containing five languages: English, German,
Italian, Portuguese, and Russian. The data set is intended to support natural
language processing applications by providing links between idioms across
languages. The underlying data was crawled and integrated from various sources.
To ensure the quality of the crawled data, all idioms were evaluated by at
least two native speakers. Herein, we present the model devised for structuring
the data. We also provide the details of linking LIDIOMS to well-known
multilingual data sets such as BabelNet. The resulting data set complies with
best practices according to Linguistic Linked Open Data Community.
