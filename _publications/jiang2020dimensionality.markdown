When performing classification tasks, raw high dimensional features often
contain redundant information, and lead to increased computational complexity
and overfitting. In this paper, we assume the data samples lie on a single
underlying smooth manifold, and define intra-class and inter-class similarities
using pairwise local kernel distances. We aim to find a linear projection to
maximize the intra-class similarities and minimize the inter-class similarities
simultaneously, so that the projected low dimensional data has optimized
pairwise distances based on the label information, which is more suitable for a
Diffusion Map to do further dimensionality reduction. Numerical experiments on
several benchmark datasets show that our proposed approaches are able to
extract low dimensional discriminate features that could help us achieve higher
classification accuracy.
