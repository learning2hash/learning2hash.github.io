SLVideo is a video moment retrieval system for Sign Language videos that
incorporates facial expressions, addressing this gap in existing technology.
The system extracts embedding representations for the hand and face signs from
video frames to capture the signs in their entirety, enabling users to search
for a specific sign language video segment with text queries. A collection of
eight hours of annotated Portuguese Sign Language videos is used as the
dataset, and a CLIP model is used to generate the embeddings. The initial
results are promising in a zero-shot setting. In addition, SLVideo incorporates
a thesaurus that enables users to search for similar signs to those retrieved,
using the video segment embeddings, and also supports the edition and creation
of video sign language annotations. Project web page:
