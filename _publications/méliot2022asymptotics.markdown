In this article, we establish the mod-\(\phi\) convergence of the major index
of a uniform random standard tableau whose shape converges in the Thoma
simplex. This implies various probabilistic estimates, in particular speed of
convergence estimates of Berry--Esseen type, and strong large deviation
principles.
