We present a system for performing visual search over billions of aerial and
satellite images. The purpose of visual search is to find images that are
visually similar to a query image. We define visual similarity using 512
abstract visual features generated by a convolutional neural network that has
been trained on aerial and satellite imagery. The features are converted to
binary values to reduce data and compute requirements. We employ a hash-based
search using Bigtable, a scalable database service from Google Cloud. Searching
the continental United States at 1-meter pixel resolution, corresponding to
approximately 2 billion images, takes approximately 0.1 seconds. This system
enables real-time visual search over the surface of the earth, and an
interactive demo is available at https://search.descarteslabs.com.
