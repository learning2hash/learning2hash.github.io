We propose a data structure obtained by hierarchically averaging bag-of-word
descriptors during a sequence of views that achieves average speedups in
large-scale loop closure applications ranging from 4 to 20 times on benchmark
datasets. Although simple, the method works as well as sophisticated
agglomerative schemes at a fraction of the cost with minimal loss of
performance.
