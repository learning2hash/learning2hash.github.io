Dictionaries are collections of vectors used for representations of random
vectors in Euclidean spaces. Recent research on optimal dictionaries is focused
on constructing dictionaries that offer sparse representations, i.e.,
\\(\ell_0\\)-optimal representations. Here we consider the problem of finding
optimal dictionaries with which representations of samples of a random vector
are optimal in an \\(ℓ₂\\)-sense: optimality of representation is defined as
attaining the minimal average \\(ℓ₂\\)-norm of the coefficients used to
represent the random vector. With the help of recent results on rank-\\(1\\)
decompositions of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices, we provide an
explicit description of \\(ℓ₂\\)-optimal dictionaries as well as their
algorithmic constructions in polynomial time.
