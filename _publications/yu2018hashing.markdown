Recently hashing techniques have gained importance in large45;scale retrieval tasks because of their retrieval speed. Most of the existing cross45;view frameworks assume that data are well paired. However the fully45;paired multiview situation is not universal in real applications. The aim of the method proposed in this paper is to learn the hashing function for semi45;paired cross45;view retrieval tasks. To utilize the label information of partial data we propose a semi45;supervised hashing learning framework which jointly performs feature extraction and classifier learning. The experimental results on two datasets show that our method outperforms several state45;of45;the45;art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy.
