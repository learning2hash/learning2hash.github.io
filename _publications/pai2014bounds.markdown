The set of all subspaces of \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\) is denoted by \\(\mathbb\{P\}_q(n)\\).
The subspace distance \\(d_S(X,Y) = \dim(X)+ \dim(Y) - 2\dim(X \cap Y)\\) defined
on \\(\mathbb\{P\}_q(n)\\) turns it into a natural coding space for error correction
in random network coding. A subset of \\(\mathbb\{P\}_q(n)\\) is called a code and
the subspaces that belong to the code are called codewords. Motivated by
classical coding theory, a linear coding structure can be imposed on a subset
of \\(\mathbb\{P\}_q(n)\\). Braun, Etzion and Vardy conjectured that the largest
cardinality of a linear code, that contains \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\), is \\(2^n\\). In this
paper, we prove this conjecture and characterize the maximal linear codes that
contain \\(\mathbb\{F\}_q^n\\).
