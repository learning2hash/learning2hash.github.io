This paper proposed a new explicit nonlinear dimensionality reduction using
neural networks for image retrieval tasks. We first proposed a Quasi-curvature
Locally Linear Embedding (QLLE) for training set. QLLE guarantees the linear
criterion in neighborhood of each sample. Then, a neural method (NM) is
proposed for out-of-sample problem. Combining QLLE and NM, we provide a
explicit nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach for efficient image
retrieval. The experimental results in three benchmark datasets illustrate that
our method can get better performance than other state-of-the-art out-of-sample
methods.
