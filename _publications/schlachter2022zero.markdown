When creating 3D content, highly specialized skills are generally needed to
design and generate models of objects and other assets by hand. We address this
problem through high-quality 3D asset retrieval from multi-modal inputs,
including 2D sketches, images and text. We use CLIP as it provides a bridge to
higher-level latent features. We use these features to perform a multi-modality
fusion to address the lack of artistic control that affects common data-driven
approaches. Our approach allows for multi-modal conditional feature-driven
retrieval through a 3D asset database, by utilizing a combination of input
latent embeddings. We explore the effects of different combinations of feature
embeddings across different input types and weighting methods.
