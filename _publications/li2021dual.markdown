Learning novel classes from a very few labeled samples has attracted
increasing attention in machine learning areas. Recent research on either
meta-learning based or transfer-learning based paradigm demonstrates that
gaining information on a good feature space can be an effective solution to
achieve favorable performance on few-shot tasks. In this paper, we propose a
simple but effective paradigm that decouples the tasks of learning feature
representations and classifiers and only learns the feature embedding
architecture from base classes via the typical transfer-learning training
strategy. To maintain both the generalization ability across base and novel
classes and discrimination ability within each class, we propose a dual path
feature learning scheme that effectively combines structural similarity with
contrastive feature construction. In this way, both inner-class alignment and
inter-class uniformity can be well balanced, and result in improved
performance. Experiments on three popular benchmarks show that when
incorporated with a simple prototype based classifier, our method can still
achieve promising results for both standard and generalized few-shot problems
in either an inductive or transductive inference setting.
