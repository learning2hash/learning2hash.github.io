We have seen significant leapfrog advancement in machine learning in recent
decades. The central idea of machine learnability lies on constructing learning
algorithms that learn from good data. The availability of more data being made
publicly available also accelerates the growth of AI in recent years. In the
domain of computer vision, the quality of image data arises from the accuracy
of image annotation. Labeling large volume of image data is a daunting and
tedious task. This work presents an End-to-End pipeline tool for object
annotation and recognition aims at enabling quick image labeling. We have
developed a modular image annotation platform which seamlessly incorporates
assisted image annotation (annotation assistance), active learning and model
training and evaluation. Our approach provides a number of advantages over
current image annotation tools. Firstly, the annotation assistance utilizes
reference hierarchy and reference images to locate the objects in the images,
thus reducing the need for annotating the whole object. Secondly, images can be
annotated using polygon points allowing for objects of any shape to be
annotated. Thirdly, it is also interoperable across several image models, and
the tool provides an interface for object model training and evaluation across
a series of pre-trained models. We have tested the model and embeds several
benchmarking deep learning models. The highest accuracy achieved is 74%.
