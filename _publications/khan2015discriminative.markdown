Indoor scene recognition is a multi-faceted and challenging problem due to
the diverse intra-class variations and the confusing inter-class similarities.
This paper presents a novel approach which exploits rich mid-level
convolutional features to categorize indoor scenes. Traditionally used
convolutional features preserve the global spatial structure, which is a
desirable property for general object recognition. However, we argue that this
structuredness is not much helpful when we have large variations in scene
layouts, e.g., in indoor scenes. We propose to transform the structured
convolutional activations to another highly discriminative feature space. The
representation in the transformed space not only incorporates the
discriminative aspects of the target dataset, but it also encodes the features
in terms of the general object categories that are present in indoor scenes. To
this end, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of 1300 object categories
which are commonly present in indoor scenes. Our proposed approach achieves a
significant performance boost over previous state of the art approaches on five
major scene classification datasets.
