We obtain an upper bound on the minimal number of points in an
\\(\epsilon\\)-chain joining two points in a metric space. This generalizes a bound
due to Hambly and Kumagai (1999) for the case of resistance metric on certain
self-similar fractals. As an application, we deduce a condition on
\\(\epsilon\\)-chains introduced by Grigor'yan and Telcs (2012). This allows us to
obtain sharp bounds on the heat kernel for spaces satisfying the parabolic
Harnack inequality without assuming further conditions on the metric. A
snowflake transform on the Euclidean space shows that our bound is sharp.
