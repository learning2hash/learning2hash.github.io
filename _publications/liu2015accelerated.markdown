<p>We propose a novel distance to calculate distance between high
dimensional vector pairs, utilizing vector quantization generated
encodings. Vector quantization based methods are successful in handling
large scale high dimensional data. These methods compress vectors into
short encodings, and allow efficient distance computation between an
uncompressed vector and compressed dataset without decompressing
explicitly. However for large datasets, these distance computing methods
perform excessive computations. We avoid excessive computations by
storing the encodings on an Encoding Tree(E-Tree), interestingly the
memory consumption is also lowered. We also propose Encoding
Forest(E-Forest) to further lower the computation cost. E-Tree and
E-Forest is compatible with various existing quantization-based methods.
We show by experiments our methods speed-up distance computing for high
dimensional data drastically, and various existing algorithms can
benefit from our methods.</p>
