We investigate the close relation between certain weighted Sobolev spaces
(Kondratiev spaces) and refined localization spaces from introduced by Triebel
[39,40]. In particular, using a characterization for refined localization
spaces from Scharf [32], we considerably improve an embedding from Hansen [17].
This embedding is of special interest in connection with convergence rates for
adaptive approximation schemes.
