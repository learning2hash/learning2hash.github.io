Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven interest in
billion-scale retrieval models with strong generalization across retrieval
tasks and languages. Additionally, progress in large vision-language models has
created new opportunities for multimodal retrieval. In response, we have
updated the Tevatron toolkit, introducing a unified pipeline that enables
researchers to explore retriever models at different scales, across multiple
languages, and with various modalities. This demo paper highlights the
toolkit's key features, bridging academia and industry by supporting efficient
training, inference, and evaluation of neural retrievers. We showcase a unified
dense retriever achieving strong multilingual and multimodal effectiveness, and
conduct a cross-modality zero-shot study to demonstrate its research potential.
Alongside, we release OmniEmbed, to the best of our knowledge, the first
embedding model that unifies text, image document, video, and audio retrieval,
serving as a baseline for future research.
