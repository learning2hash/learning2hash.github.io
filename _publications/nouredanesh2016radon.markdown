In recent years, with the explosion of digital images on the Web,
content-based retrieval has emerged as a significant research area. Shapes,
textures, edges and segments may play a key role in describing the content of
an image. Radon and Gabor transforms are both powerful techniques that have
been widely studied to extract shape-texture-based information. The combined
Radon-Gabor features may be more robust against scale/rotation variations,
presence of noise, and illumination changes. The objective of this paper is to
harness the potentials of both Gabor and Radon transforms in order to introduce
expressive binary features, called barcodes, for image annotation/tagging
tasks. We propose two different techniques: Gabor-of-Radon-Image Barcodes
(GRIBCs), and Guided-Radon-of-Gabor Barcodes (GRGBCs). For validation, we
employ the IRMA x-ray dataset with 193 classes, containing 12,677 training
images and 1,733 test images. A total error score as low as 322 and 330 were
achieved for GRGBCs and GRIBCs, respectively. This corresponds to \\(\approx
81%\\) retrieval accuracy for the first hit.
