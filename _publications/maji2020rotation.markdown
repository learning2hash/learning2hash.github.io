Introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks has improved results on almost
every image-based problem and Content-Based Image Retrieval is not an
exception. But the CNN features, being rotation invariant, creates problems to
build a rotation-invariant CBIR system. Though rotation-invariant features can
be hand-engineered, the retrieval accuracy is very low because by hand
engineering only low-level features can be created, unlike deep learning models
that create high-level features along with low-level features. This paper shows
a novel method to build a rotational invariant CBIR system by introducing a
deep learning orientation angle detection model along with the CBIR feature
extraction model. This paper also highlights that this rotation invariant deep
CBIR can retrieve images from a large dataset in real-time.
