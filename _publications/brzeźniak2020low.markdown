We announce a result on the existence of a unique local solution to a
stochastic geometric wave equation on the one dimensional Minkowski space
\(\mathbb\{R\}^\{1+1\}\) with values in an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold. We
consider a rough initial data in the sense that its regularity is lower than
the energy critical.
