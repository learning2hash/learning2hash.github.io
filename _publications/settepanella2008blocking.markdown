It is well know that the theory of minimal blocking sets is studied by
several author. Another theory which is also studied by a large number of
researchers is the theory of hyperplane arrangements. We can remark that the
affine space \(AG(n,q)\) is the complement of the line at infinity in \(PG(n,q)\).
Then \(AG(n,q)\) can be regarded as the complement of an hyperplane arrangement
in \(PG(n,q)\)! Therefore the study of blocking sets in the affine space
\(AG(n,q)\) is simply the study of blocking sets in the complement of a finite
arrangement in \(PG(n,q)\). In this paper the author generalizes this remark
starting to study the problem of existence of blocking sets in the complement
of a given hyperplane arrangement in \(PG(n,q)\). As an example she solves the
problem for the case of braid arrangement. Moreover she poses significant
questions on this new and interesting problem.
