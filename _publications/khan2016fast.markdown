Color transfer between images uses the statistics information of image
effectively. We present a novel approach of local color transfer between images
based on the simple statistics and locally linear embedding. A sketching
interface is proposed for quickly and easily specifying the color
correspondences between target and source image. The user can specify the
correspondences of local region using scribes, which more accurately transfers
the target color to the source image while smoothly preserving the boundaries,
and exhibits more natural output results. Our algorithm is not restricted to
one-to-one image color transfer and can make use of more than one target images
to transfer the color in different regions in the source image. Moreover, our
algorithm does not require to choose the same color style and image size
between source and target images. We propose the sub-sampling to reduce the
computational load. Comparing with other approaches, our algorithm is much
better in color blending in the input data. Our approach preserves the other
color details in the source image. Various experimental results show that our
approach specifies the correspondences of local color region in source and
target images. And it expresses the intention of users and generates more
actual and natural results of visual effect.
