This paper studies fast fusion of dense retrieval and sparse lexical
retrieval, and proposes a cluster-based selective dense retrieval method called
CluSD guided by sparse lexical retrieval. CluSD takes a lightweight
cluster-based approach and exploits the overlap of sparse retrieval results and
embedding clusters in a two-stage selection process with an LSTM model to
quickly identify relevant clusters while incurring limited extra memory space
overhead. CluSD triggers partial dense retrieval and performs cluster-based
block disk I/O if needed. This paper evaluates CluSD and compares it with
several baselines for searching in-memory and on-disk MS MARCO and BEIR
datasets.
