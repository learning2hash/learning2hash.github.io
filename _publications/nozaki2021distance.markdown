The number-theoretic codes are a class of codes defined by single or multiple
congruences and are mainly used for correcting insertion and deletion errors.
Since the number-theoretic codes are generally non-linear, the analysis method
for such codes is not established enough. The distance enumerator of a code is
a unary polynomial whose \(i\)th coefficient gives the number of the pairs of
codewords with distance \(i\). The distance enumerator gives the maximum
likelihood decoding error probability of the code. This paper presents an
identity of the distance enumerators for the number-theoretic codes. Moreover,
as an example, we derive the Hamming distance enumerator for the
Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes.
