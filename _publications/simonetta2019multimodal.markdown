Towards improving the performance in various music information processing
tasks, recent studies exploit different modalities able to capture diverse
aspects of music. Such modalities include audio recordings, symbolic music
scores, mid-level representations, motion, and gestural data, video recordings,
editorial or cultural tags, lyrics and album cover arts. This paper critically
reviews the various approaches adopted in Music Information Processing and
Retrieval and highlights how multimodal algorithms can help Music Computing
applications. First, we categorize the related literature based on the
application they address. Subsequently, we analyze existing information fusion
approaches, and we conclude with the set of challenges that Music Information
Retrieval and Sound and Music Computing research communities should focus in
the next years.
