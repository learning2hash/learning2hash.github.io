This paper presents the InScript corpus (Narrative Texts Instantiating Script
structure). InScript is a corpus of 1,000 stories centered around 10 different
scenarios. Verbs and noun phrases are annotated with event and participant
types, respectively. Additionally, the text is annotated with coreference
information. The corpus shows rich lexical variation and will serve as a unique
resource for the study of the role of script knowledge in natural language
processing.
