A point of a metric space is called a geodesic star with \\(m\\) arms if it is
the endpoint of \\(m\\) disjoint geodesics. For every \\(m\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\), we prove
that the set of all geodesic stars with \\(m\\) arms in the Brownian sphere has
dimension \\(5-m\\). This complements recent results of Miller and Qian, who proved
that this dimension is smaller than or equal to \\(5-m\\).
