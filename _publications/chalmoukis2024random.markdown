We study the Kolmogorov 0-1 law for a random sequence with prescribed radii
so that it generates a Carleson measure almost surely, both for the Hardy space
on the polydisc and the Hardy space on the unit ball, thus providing improved
versions of previous results of the first two authors and of a separate result
of Massaneda. In the polydisc, the geometry of such sequences is not well
understood, so we proceed by studying the random Gramians generated by random
sequences, using tools from the theory of random matrices. Another result we
prove, and that is of its own relevance, is the 0-1 law for a random sequence
to be partitioned into M separated sequences with respect to the
pseudo-hyperbolic distance, which is used also to describe the random sequences
that are interpolating for the Bloch space on the unit disc almost surely.
