In this paper, we investigate the fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) for
discrete Cantor sets, which are determined by an alphabet from a base of
digits. Consider the base of M digits and the alphabets of cardinality A such
that all the corresponding Cantor sets have a fixed dimension 0<log A/log
M<2/3. We prove that the FUP with an improved exponent over Dyatlov-Jin
(arXiv:1608.02238) holds for almost all alphabets, asymptotically as M tends to
infinity. Our result provides the best possible exponent when the Cantor sets
enjoy either the strongest Fourier decay assumption or strongest additive
energy assumption. The proof is based on a concentration of measure phenomenon
in the space of alphabets.
