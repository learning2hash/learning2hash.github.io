Human Facial Expressions plays an important role in identifying human actions
or intention. Facial expressions can represent any specific action of any
person and the pattern of violent behavior of any person strongly depends on
the geographic region. Here we have designed an automated system by using a
Convolutional Neural Network which can detect whether a person has any
intention to commit any crime or not. Here we proposed a new method that can
identify criminal intentions or violent behavior of any person before executing
crimes more efficiently by using very little data on facial expressions before
executing a crime or any violent tasks. Instead of using image features which
is a time-consuming and faulty method we used an automated feature selector
Convolutional Neural Network model which can capture exact facial expressions
for training and then can predict that target facial expressions more
accurately. Here we used only the facial data of a specific geographic region
which can represent the violent and before-crime before-crime facial patterns
of the people of the whole region.
