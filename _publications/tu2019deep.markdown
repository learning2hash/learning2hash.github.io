Due to their high retrieval efficiency and low storage cost cross45;modal hashing methods have attracted considerable attention. Generally compared with shallow cross45;modal hashing methods deep cross45;modal hashing methods can achieve a more satisfactory performance by integrating feature learning and hash codes optimizing into a same framework. However most existing deep cross45;modal hashing methods either cannot learn a unified hash code for the two correlated data45;points of different modalities in a database instance or cannot guide the learning of unified hash codes by the feedback of hashing function learning procedure to enhance the retrieval accuracy. To address the issues above in this paper we propose a novel end45;to45;end Deep Cross45;Modal Hashing with Hashing Functions and Unified Hash Codes Jointly Learning (DCHUC). Specifically by an iterative optimization algorithm DCHUC jointly learns unified hash codes for image45;text pairs in a database and a pair of hash functions for unseen query image45;text pairs. With the iterative optimization algorithm the learned unified hash codes can be used to guide the hashing function learning procedure; Meanwhile the learned hashing functions can feedback to guide the unified hash codes optimizing procedure. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art cross45;modal hashing methods.
