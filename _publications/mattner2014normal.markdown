The Kolmogorov distances between a symmetric hypergeometric law with standard
deviation \\(\sigma\\) and its usual normal approximations are computed and shown
to be less than \\(1/(\sqrt\{8\pi\}\,\sigma)\\), with the order \\(1/\sigma\\) and the
constant \\(1/\sqrt\{8\pi\}\\) being optimal. The results of Hipp and Mattner (2007)
for symmetric binomial laws are obtained as special cases. Connections to
Berry-Esseen type results in more general situations concerning sums of simple
random samples or Bernoulli convolutions are explained. Auxiliary results of
independent interest include rather sharp normal distribution function
inequalities, a simple identifiability result for hypergeometric laws, and some
remarks related to L\'evy's concentration-variance inequality.
