This paper presents a new approach for detecting outliers by introducing the
notion of object's proximity. The main idea is that normal point has similar
characteristics with several neighbors. So the point in not an outlier if it
has a high degree of proximity and its neighbors are several. The performance
of this approach is illustrated through real datasets
