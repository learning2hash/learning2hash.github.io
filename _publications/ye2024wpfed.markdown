Decentralized learning has become crucial for collaborative model training in
environments where data privacy and trust are paramount. In web-based
applications, clients are liberated from traditional fixed network topologies,
enabling the establishment of arbitrary peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. While
this flexibility is highly promising, it introduces a fundamental challenge:
the optimal selection of neighbors to ensure effective collaboration. To
address this, we introduce WPFed, a fully decentralized, web-based learning
framework designed to enable globally optimal neighbor selection. WPFed employs
a dynamic communication graph and a weighted neighbor selection mechanism. By
assessing inter-client similarity through Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and
evaluating model quality based on peer rankings, WPFed enables clients to
identify personalized optimal neighbors on a global scale while preserving data
privacy. To enhance security and deter malicious behavior, WPFed integrates
verification mechanisms for both LSH codes and performance rankings, leveraging
blockchain-driven announcements to ensure transparency and verifiability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that WPFed significantly improves learning outcomes and system robustness
compared to traditional federated learning methods. Our findings highlight
WPFed's potential to facilitate effective and secure decentralized
collaborative learning across diverse and interconnected web environments.
