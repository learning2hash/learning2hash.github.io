In this brief technical report we introduce the CINIC-10 dataset as a plug-in
extended alternative for CIFAR-10. It was compiled by combining CIFAR-10 with
images selected and downsampled from the ImageNet database. We present the
approach to compiling the dataset, illustrate the example images for different
classes, give pixel distributions for each part of the repository, and give
some standard benchmarks for well known models. Details for download, usage,
and compilation can be found in the associated github repository.
