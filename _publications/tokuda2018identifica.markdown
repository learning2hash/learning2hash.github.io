Graffiti tagging is a common issue in great cities an local authorities are
on the move to combat it. The tagging map of a city can be a useful tool as it
may help to clean-up highly saturated regions and discourage future acts in the
neighbourhood and currently there is no way of getting a tagging map of a
region in an automatic fashion and manual inspection or crowd participation are
required. In this work, we describe a work in progress in creating an automatic
way to get a tagging map of a city or region. It is based on the use of street
view images and on the detection of graffiti tags in the images.
