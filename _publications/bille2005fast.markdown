We study 4 problems in string matching, namely, regular expression matching,
approximate regular expression matching, string edit distance, and subsequence
indexing, on a standard word RAM model of computation that allows
logarithmic-sized words to be manipulated in constant time. We show how to
improve the space and/or remove a dependency on the alphabet size for each
problem using either an improved tabulation technique of an existing algorithm
or by combining known algorithms in a new way.
