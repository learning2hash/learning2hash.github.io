We consider a problem introduced by Mossel and Ross [Shotgun assembly of
labeled graphs, arXiv:1504.07682]. Suppose a random \\(n\times n\\) jigsaw puzzle
is constructed by independently and uniformly choosing the shape of each "jig"
from \\(q\\) possibilities. We are given the shuffled pieces. Then, depending on
\\(q\\), what is the probability that we can reassemble the puzzle uniquely? We say
that two solutions of a puzzle are similar if they only differ by permutation
of duplicate pieces, and rotation of rotationally symmetric pieces. In this
paper, we show that, with high probability, such a puzzle has at least two
non-similar solutions when \\(2\leq q \leq \frac\{2\}\{\sqrt\{e\}\}n\\), all solutions
are similar when \\(q\geq (2+\epsilon)n\\), and the solution is unique when
\\(q=\omega(n)\\).
