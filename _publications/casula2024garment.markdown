In the rapidly evolving field of online fashion shopping, the need for more
personalized and interactive image retrieval systems has become paramount.
Existing methods often struggle with precisely manipulating specific garment
attributes without inadvertently affecting others. To address this challenge,
we propose GAMMA (Garment Attribute Manipulation with Multi-level Attention), a
novel framework that integrates attribute-disentangled representations with a
multi-stage attention-based architecture. GAMMA enables targeted manipulation
of fashion image attributes, allowing users to refine their searches with high
accuracy. By leveraging a dual-encoder Transformer and memory block, our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like Shopping100k and
DeepFashion.
