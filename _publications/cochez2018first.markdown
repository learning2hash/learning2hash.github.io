Graph embedding models produce embedding vectors for entities and relations
in Knowledge Graphs, often without taking literal properties into account. We
show an initial idea based on the combination of global graph structure with
additional information provided by textual information in properties. Our
initial experiment shows that this approach might be useful, but does not
clearly outperform earlier approaches when evaluated on machine learning tasks.
