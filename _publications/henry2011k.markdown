In this paper, we consider a k-nearest neighbor kernel type estimator when
the random variables belong in a Riemannian manifolds. We study asymptotic
properties such as the consistency and the asymptotic distribution. A
simulation study is also consider to evaluate the performance of the proposal.
Finally, to illustrate the potential applications of the proposed estimator, we
analyzed two real example where two different manifolds are considered.
