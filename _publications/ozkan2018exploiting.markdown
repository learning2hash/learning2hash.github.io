The cost-effective visual representation and fast query-by-example search are
two challenging goals that should be maintained for web-scale visual retrieval
tasks on moderate hardware. This paper introduces a fast and robust method that
ensures both of these goals by obtaining state-of-the-art performance for an
image-to-video search scenario. Hence, we present critical enhancements to
well-known indexing and visual representation techniques by promoting faster,
better and moderate retrieval performance. We also boost the superiority of our
method for some visual challenges by exploiting individual decisions of local
and global descriptors at query time. For instance, local content descriptors
represent copied/duplicated scenes with large geometric deformations such as
scale, orientation and affine transformation. In contrast, the use of global
content descriptors is more practical for near-duplicate and semantic searches.
Experiments are conducted on a large-scale Stanford I2V dataset. The
experimental results show that our method is useful in terms of complexity and
query processing time for large-scale visual retrieval scenarios, even if local
and global representations are used together. The proposed method is superior
and achieves state-of-the-art performance based on the mean average precision
(MAP) score of this dataset. Lastly, we report additional MAP scores after
updating the ground annotations unveiled by retrieval results of the proposed
method, and it shows that the actual performance.
