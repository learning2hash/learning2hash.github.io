Large45;scale is a trend in person re45;identification (re45;id). It is important that real45;time search be performed in a large gallery. While previous methods mostly focus on discriminative learning this paper makes the attempt in integrating deep learning and hashing into one framework to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy for large45;scale person re45;id. We integrate spatial information for discriminative visual representation by partitioning the pedestrian image into horizontal parts. Specifically Part45;based Deep Hashing (PDH) is proposed in which batches of triplet samples are employed as the input of the deep hashing architecture. Each triplet sample contains two pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity and one pedestrian image (or part) of the different identity. A triplet loss function is employed with a constraint that the Hamming distance of pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity is smaller than ones with the different identity. In the experiment we show that the proposed Part45;based Deep Hashing method yields very competitive re45;id accuracy on the large45;scale Market45;1501 and Market45;1501+500K datasets.
