Recent development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has attracted growing attention within the AI landscape for its practical implementation potential. However hallucination or more specifically the misalignment between factual visual content and corresponding textual generation poses a significant challenge of utilizing LVLMs. In this comprehensive survey we dissect LVLM-related hallucinations in an attempt to establish an overview and facilitate future mitigation. Our scrutiny starts with a clarification of the concept of hallucinations in LVLMs presenting a variety of hallucination symptoms and highlighting the unique challenges inherent in LVLM hallucinations. Subsequently we outline the benchmarks and methodologies tailored specifically for evaluating hallucinations unique to LVLMs. Additionally we delve into an investigation of the root causes of these hallucinations encompassing insights from the training data and model components. We also critically review existing methods for mitigating hallucinations. The open questions and future directions pertaining to hallucinations within LVLMs are discussed to conclude this survey.
