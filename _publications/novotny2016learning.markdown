While recent research in image understanding has often focused on recognizing
more types of objects, understanding more about the objects is just as
important. Recognizing object parts and attributes has been extensively studied
before, yet learning large space of such concepts remains elusive due to the
high cost of providing detailed object annotations for supervision. The key
contribution of this paper is an algorithm to learn the nameable parts of
objects automatically, from images obtained by querying Web search engines. The
key challenge is the high level of noise in the annotations; to address it, we
propose a new unified embedding space where the appearance and geometry of
objects and their semantic parts are represented uniformly. Geometric
relationships are induced in a soft manner by a rich set of nonsemantic
mid-level anchors, bridging the gap between semantic and non-semantic parts. We
also show that the resulting embedding provides a visually-intuitive mechanism
to navigate the learned concepts and their corresponding images.
