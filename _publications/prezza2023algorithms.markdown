These are the lecture notes for the course CM0622 - Algorithms for Massive Data Ca Foscari University of Venice. The goal of this course is to introduce algorithmic techniques for dealing with massive data data so large that it does not fit in the computers memory. There are two main solutions to deal with massive data (lossless) compressed data structures and (lossy) data sketches. These notes cover both topics compressed suffix arrays probabilistic filters sketching under various metrics Locality Sensitive Hashing nearest neighbour search algorithms on streams (pattern matching counting).
