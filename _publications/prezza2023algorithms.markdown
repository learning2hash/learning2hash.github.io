These are the lecture notes for the course CM0622 - Algorithms for Massive
Data, Ca' Foscari University of Venice. The goal of this course is to introduce
algorithmic techniques for dealing with massive data: data so large that it
does not fit in the computer's memory. There are two main solutions to deal
with massive data: (lossless) compressed data structures and (lossy) data
sketches. These notes cover both topics: compressed suffix arrays,
probabilistic filters, sketching under various metrics, Locality Sensitive
Hashing, nearest neighbour search, algorithms on streams.
