Many text databases on the web are "hidden" behind search interfaces, and
their documents are only accessible through querying. Search engines typically
ignore the contents of such search-only databases. Recently, Yahoo-like
directories have started to manually organize these databases into categories
that users can browse to find these valuable resources. We propose a novel
strategy to automate the classification of search-only text databases. Our
technique starts by training a rule-based document classifier, and then uses
the classifier's rules to generate probing queries. The queries are sent to the
text databases, which are then classified based on the number of matches that
they produce for each query. We report some initial exploratory experiments
that show that our approach is promising to automatically characterize the
contents of text databases accessible on the web.
