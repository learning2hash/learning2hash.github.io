CNNs have massively improved performance in object detection in photographs.
However research into object detection in artwork remains limited. We show
state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset, People-Art, which
contains people from photos, cartoons and 41 different artwork movements. We
achieve this high performance by fine-tuning a CNN for this task, thus also
demonstrating that training CNNs on photos results in overfitting for photos:
only the first three or four layers transfer from photos to artwork. Although
the CNN's performance is the highest yet, it remains less than 60% AP,
suggesting further work is needed for the cross-depiction problem. The final
