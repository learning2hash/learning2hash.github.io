Graphs are widely adopted tools for encoding information. Generally, they are
applied to disparate research fields where data needs to be represented in
terms of local and spatial connections. In this context, a structure for
ditigal image representation, called Attributed Relational SIFT-based Regions
Graph (ARSRG), previously introduced, is presented. ARSRG has not been explored
in detail in previous works and for this reason the goal is to investigate
unknown aspects. The study is divided into two parts. A first, theoretical,
introducing formal definitions, not yet specified previously, with purpose to
clarify its structural configuration. A second, experimental, which provides
fundamental elements about its adaptability and flexibility regarding different
applications. The theoretical vision combined with the experimental one shows
how the structure is adaptable to image representation including contents of
different nature.
