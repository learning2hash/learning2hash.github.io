Manipulation of biomedical images to misrepresent experimental results has
plagued the biomedical community for a while. Recent interest in the problem
led to the curation of a dataset and associated tasks to promote the
development of biomedical forensic methods. Of these, the largest manipulation
detection task focuses on the detection of duplicated regions between images.
Traditional computer-vision based forensic models trained on natural images are
not designed to overcome the challenges presented by biomedical images. We
propose a multi-scale overlap detection model to detect duplicated image
regions. Our model is structured to find duplication hierarchically, so as to
reduce the number of patch operations. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
overall and on multiple biomedical image categories.
