String similarity, longest common subsequence and shortest edit scripts are
the triplets of problem that related to each other. There are different
algorithms exist to generate edit script by solving longest common subsequence
problem. This paper proposes an algorithm that uses string similarity problem
to generate shortest edit script. For this we use the famous Levenshtein
distance algorithm, which computes a numerical value that represents similarity
between the strings from 0 to n, where n is the length of longest input string,
and produce the shortest edit script which contains instructions of Insert,
Delete and Substitute.
