Recent advancement of the WWW, IOT, social network, e-commerce, etc. have
generated a large volume of data. These datasets are mostly represented by high
dimensional and sparse datasets. Many fundamental subroutines of common data
analytic tasks such as clustering, classification, ranking, nearest neighbour
search, etc. scale poorly with the dimension of the dataset. In this work, we
address this problem and propose a sketching (alternatively, dimensionality
reduction) algorithm -- \(\binsketch\) (Binary Data Sketch) -- for sparse binary
datasets. \(\binsketch\) preserves the binary version of the dataset after
sketching and maintains estimates for multiple similarity measures such as
Jaccard, Cosine, Inner-Product similarities, and Hamming distance, on the same
sketch. We present a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and complement it
with extensive experimentation on several real-world datasets. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms on the task
of mean-square-error and ranking. Our proposed algorithm offers a comparable
accuracy while suggesting a significant speedup in the dimensionality reduction
time, with respect to the other candidate algorithms. Our proposal is simple,
easy to implement, and therefore can be adopted in practice.
