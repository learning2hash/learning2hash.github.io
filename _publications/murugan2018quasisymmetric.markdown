We show that the circle packing embedding in \(\mathbb\{R\}^2\) of a one-ended,
planar triangulation with polynomial growth is quasisymmetric if and only if
the simple random walk on the graph satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimate
with spectral dimension two. Our main results provide a new family of graphs
and fractals that satisfy sub-Gaussian estimates and Harnack inequalities.
