This paper proposes an end45;to45;end deep hashing framework with category mask for fast video retrieval. We train our network in a supervised way by fully exploiting inter45;class diversity and intra45;class identity. Classification loss is optimized to maximize inter45;class diversity while intra45;pair is introduced to learn representative intra45;class identity. We investigate the binary bits distribution related to categories and find out that the effectiveness of binary bits is highly correlated with data categories and some bits may degrade classification performance of some categories. We then design hash code generation scheme with category mask to filter out bits with negative contribution. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms several state45;of45;the45;arts under various evaluation metrics on public datasets.
