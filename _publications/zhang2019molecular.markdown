An image dataset of 10 different size molecules, where each molecule has
2,000 structural variants, is generated from the 2D cross-sectional projection
of Molecular Dynamics trajectories. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a
benchmark dataset for the increasing need of machine learning, deep learning
and image processing on the study of scattering, imaging and microscopy.
