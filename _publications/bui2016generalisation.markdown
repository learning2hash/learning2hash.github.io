We propose and evaluate several triplet CNN architectures for measuring the similarity between sketches and photographs within the context of the sketch based image retrieval (SBIR) task. In contrast to recent fine-grained SBIR work we study the ability of our networks to generalise across diverse object categories from limited training data and explore in detail strategies for weight sharing pre-processing data augmentation and dimensionality reduction. We exceed the performance of pre-existing techniques on both the Flickr15k category level SBIR benchmark by 18 and the TU-Berlin SBIR benchmark by sim10 _b when trained on the 250 category TU-Berlin classification dataset augmented with 25k corresponding photographs harvested from the Internet.
