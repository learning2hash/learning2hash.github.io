We propose and evaluate several triplet CNN architectures for measuring the
similarity between sketches and photographs, within the context of the sketch
based image retrieval (SBIR) task. In contrast to recent fine-grained SBIR
work, we study the ability of our networks to generalise across diverse object
categories from limited training data, and explore in detail strategies for
weight sharing, pre-processing, data augmentation and dimensionality reduction.
We exceed the performance of pre-existing techniques on both the Flickr15k
category level SBIR benchmark by \\(18%\\), and the TU-Berlin SBIR benchmark by
\\(\sim10 \mathcal\{T\}_b\\), when trained on the 250 category TU-Berlin
classification dataset augmented with 25k corresponding photographs harvested
from the Internet.
