Prior work has shown that Twitter users use skin-toned emoji as an act of
self-representation to express their racial/ethnic identity. We test whether
this signal of identity can influence readers' perceptions about the content of
a post containing that signal. In a large scale (n=944) pre-registered
controlled experiment, we manipulate the presence of skin-toned emoji and
profile photos in a task where readers rate obscure trivia facts (presented as
tweets) as true or false. Using a Bayesian statistical analysis, we find that
neither emoji nor profile photo has an effect on how readers rate these facts.
This result will be of some comfort to anyone concerned about the manipulation
of online users through the crafting of fake profiles.
