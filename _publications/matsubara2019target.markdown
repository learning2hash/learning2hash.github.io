Multimodal embedding is a crucial research topic for cross-modal
understanding, data mining, and translation. Many studies have attempted to
extract representations from given entities and align them in a shared
embedding space. However, because entities in different modalities exhibit
different abstraction levels and modality-specific information, it is
insufficient to embed related entities close to each other. In this study, we
propose the Target-Oriented Deformation Network (TOD-Net), a novel module that
continuously deforms the embedding space into a new space under a given
condition, thereby adjusting similarities between entities. Unlike methods
based on cross-modal attention, TOD-Net is a post-process applied to the
embedding space learned by existing embedding systems and improves their
performances of retrieval. In particular, when combined with cutting-edge
models, TOD-Net gains the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval model
associated with the MSCOCO dataset. Qualitative analysis reveals that TOD-Net
successfully emphasizes entity-specific concepts and retrieves diverse targets
via handling higher levels of diversity than existing models.
