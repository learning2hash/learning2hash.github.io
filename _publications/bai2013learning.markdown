Image retrieval refers to finding relevant images from an image database for
a query, which is considered difficult for the gap between low-level
representation of images and high-level representation of queries. Recently
further developed Deep Neural Network sheds light on automatically learning
high-level image representation from raw pixels. In this paper, we proposed a
multi-task DNN learned for image retrieval, which contains two parts, i.e.,
query-sharing layers for image representation computation and query-specific
layers for relevance estimation. The weights of multi-task DNN are learned on
clickthrough data by Ring Training. Experimental results on both simulated and
real dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
