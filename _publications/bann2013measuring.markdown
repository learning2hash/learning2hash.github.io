Researchers since at least Darwin have debated whether and to what extent
emotions are universal or culture-dependent. However, previous studies have
primarily focused on facial expressions and on a limited set of emotions. Given
that emotions have a substantial impact on human lives, evidence for cultural
emotional relativity might be derived by applying distributional semantics
techniques to a text corpus of self-reported behaviour. Here, we explore this
idea by measuring the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion
keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter. We do this in three
geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. We demonstrate that in
our sample, the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ
significantly with respect to these geographical regions --- Europeans are, or
at least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are
more negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when
compared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords. Our
work is the first in kind to programatically map large text corpora to a
dimensional model of affect.
