We propose a new colour transfer method with Optimal Transport (OT) to
transfer the colour of a sourceimage to match the colour of a target image of
the same scene that may exhibit large motion changes betweenimages. By
definition OT does not take into account any available information about
correspondences whencomputing the optimal solution. To tackle this problem we
propose to encode overlapping neighborhoodsof pixels using both their colour
and spatial correspondences estimated using motion estimation. We solvethe high
dimensional problem in 1D space using an iterative projection approach. We
further introducesmoothing as part of the iterative algorithms for solving
optimal transport namely Iterative DistributionTransport (IDT) and its variant
the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD). Experiments show quantitative
andqualitative improvements over previous state of the art colour transfer
methods.
