Given a data set \(\mathcal\{D\}\) containing millions of data points and a data
consumer who is willing to pay for \$\(X\) to train a machine learning (ML) model
over \(\mathcal\{D\}\), how should we distribute this \$\(X\) to each data point to
reflect its "value"? In this paper, we define the "relative value of data" via
the Shapley value, as it uniquely possesses properties with appealing
real-world interpretations, such as fairness, rationality and
decentralizability. For general, bounded utility functions, the Shapley value
is known to be challenging to compute: to get Shapley values for all \(N\) data
points, it requires \(O(2^N)\) model evaluations for exact computation and
\(O(Nlog N)\) for \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-approximation. In this paper, we focus on
one popular family of ML models relying on \(K\)-nearest neighbors (\(K\)NN). The
most surprising result is that for unweighted \(K\)NN classifiers and regressors,
the Shapley value of all \(N\) data points can be computed, exactly, in \(O(Nlog
N)\) time -- an exponential improvement on computational complexity! Moreover,
for \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-approximation, we are able to develop an algorithm
based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with only sublinear complexity
\(O(N^\{h(\epsilon,K)\}log N)\) when \(\epsilon\) is not too small and \(K\) is not
too large. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on up to \(10\) million data
points and even our exact algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster
than the baseline approximation algorithm. The LSH-based approximation
algorithm can accelerate the value calculation process even further. We then
extend our algorithms to other scenarios such as (1) weighed \(K\)NN classifiers,
(2) different data points are clustered by different data curators, and (3)
there are data analysts providing computation who also requires proper
valuation.
