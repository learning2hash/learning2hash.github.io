Semantic hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast similarity search in many information retrieval systems. While fairly successful previous techniques generally require two45;stage training and the binary constraints are handled ad45;hoc. In this paper we present an end45;to45;end Neural Architecture for Semantic Hashing (NASH) where the binary hashing codes are treated as Bernoulli latent variables. A neural variational inference framework is proposed for training where gradients are directly back45;propagated through the discrete latent variable to optimize the hash function. We also draw connections between proposed method and rate45;distortion theory which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state45;of45;the45;art models on both unsupervised and supervised scenarios.
