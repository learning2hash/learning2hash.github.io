Semantic hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast similarity search
in many information retrieval systems.
While fairly successful, previous techniques generally require two-stage training, and the binary constraints are handled ad-hoc. In this paper, we present
an end-to-end Neural Architecture for Semantic Hashing (NASH), where the binary
hashing codes are treated as Bernoulli latent variables. A neural variational inference framework is proposed for training, where gradients are directly backpropagated through the discrete latent
variable to optimize the hash function.
We also draw connections between proposed method and rate-distortion theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results on
three public datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms several
state-of-the-art models on both unsupervised and supervised scenarios.
