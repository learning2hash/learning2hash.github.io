We address the problem of subsequence search in time series using Chebyshev
distance, to which we refer as twin subsequence search. We first show how
existing time series indices can be extended to perform twin subsequence
search. Then, we introduce TS-Index, a novel index tailored to this problem.
Our experimental evaluation compares these approaches against real time series
datasets, and demonstrates that TS-Index can retrieve twin subsequences much
faster under various query conditions. This paper has been published in the
24th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT 2021).
