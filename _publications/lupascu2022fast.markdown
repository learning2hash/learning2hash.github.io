In this work, we propose a complete framework that generates visual art.
Unlike previous stylization methods that are not flexible with style parameters
(i.e., they allow stylization with only one style image, a single stylization
text or stylization of a content image from a certain domain), our method has
no such restriction. In addition, we implement an improved version that can
generate a wide range of results with varying degrees of detail, style and
structure, with a boost in generation speed. To further enhance the results, we
insert an artistic super-resolution module in the generative pipeline. This
module will bring additional details such as patterns specific to painters,
slight brush marks, and so on.
