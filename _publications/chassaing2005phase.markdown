In this paper, we consider hashing with linear probing for a hashing table
with m places, n items (n < m), and l = m<n empty places. For a non computer
science-minded reader, we shall use the metaphore of n cars parking on m
places: each car chooses a place at random, and if this place k is occupied,
the car tries successively k+1, k+2, ... until it finds an empty place (with
the convention that place m+1 is actually place 1). Pittel [42] proves that
when l/m goes to some positive limit a < 1, the size of the largest block of
consecutive cars is O(log m). In this paper we examine at which level for n a
phase transition occurs for the largest block of consecutive cars between o(m)
and O(m). The intermediate case reveals an interesting behaviour of sizes of
blocks, related to the standard additive coalescent in the same way as the
sizes of connected components of the random graph are related to the
multiplicative coalescent.
