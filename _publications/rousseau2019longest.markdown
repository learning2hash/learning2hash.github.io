In this paper, we study the behaviour of the longest common substring for
random subshifts of finite type (for dynamicists) or of the longest common
substring for random sequences in random environments (for probabilists). We
prove that, under some exponential mixing assumptions, this behaviour is linked
to the R\'enyi entropy of the stationary measure. We emphasize that what we
establish is a quenched result.
