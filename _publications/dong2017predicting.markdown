This paper strives to find amidst a set of sentences the one best describing
the content of a given image or video. Different from existing works, which
rely on a joint subspace for their image and video caption retrieval, we
propose to do so in a visual space exclusively. Apart from this conceptual
novelty, we contribute *Word2VisualVec*, a deep neural network
architecture that learns to predict a visual feature representation from
textual input. Example captions are encoded into a textual embedding based on
multi-scale sentence vectorization and further transferred into a deep visual
feature of choice via a simple multi-layer perceptron. We further generalize
Word2VisualVec for video caption retrieval, by predicting from text both 3-D
convolutional neural network features as well as a visual-audio representation.
Experiments on Flickr8k, Flickr30k, the Microsoft Video Description dataset and
the very recent NIST TrecVid challenge for video caption retrieval detail
Word2VisualVec's properties, its benefit over textual embeddings, the potential
for multimodal query composition and its state-of-the-art results.
