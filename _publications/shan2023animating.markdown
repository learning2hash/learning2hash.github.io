We present a system that automatically brings street view imagery to life by
populating it with naturally behaving, animated pedestrians and vehicles. Our
approach is to remove existing people and vehicles from the input image, insert
moving objects with proper scale, angle, motion, and appearance, plan paths and
traffic behavior, as well as render the scene with plausible occlusion and
shadowing effects. The system achieves these by reconstructing the still image
street scene, simulating crowd behavior, and rendering with consistent
lighting, visibility, occlusions, and shadows. We demonstrate results on a
diverse range of street scenes including regular still images and panoramas.
