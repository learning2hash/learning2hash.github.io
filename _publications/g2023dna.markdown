DNA is a promising storage medium, but its stability and occurrence of Indel
errors pose a significant challenge. The relative occurrence of Guanine(G) and
Cytosine(C) in DNA is crucial for its longevity, and reverse complementary base
pairs should be avoided to prevent the formation of a secondary structure in
DNA strands. We overcome these challenges by selecting appropriate group
homomorphisms. For storing and retrieving information in DNA strings we use
kernel code and the Varshamov-Tenengolts algorithm. The Varshamov-Tenengolts
algorithm corrects single indel errors. Additionally, we construct codes of any
desired length (n) while calculating its reverse complement distance based on
the value of n.
