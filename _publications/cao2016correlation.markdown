Due to its storage and query efficiency, hashing has been widely
applied to approximate nearest neighbor search from large-scale
datasets. While there is increasing interest in cross-modal hashing
which facilitates cross-media retrieval by embedding data from different modalities into a common Hamming space, how to distill the
cross-modal correlation structure effectively remains a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised cross-modal
hashing method, Correlation Autoencoder Hashing (CAH), to learn
discriminative and compact binary codes based on deep autoencoders. Specifically, CAH jointly maximizes the feature correlation
revealed by bimodal data and the semantic correlation conveyed in
similarity labels, while embeds them into hash codes by nonlinear
deep autoencoders. Extensive experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CAH against the state-of-the-art
hashing methods on standard cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.
