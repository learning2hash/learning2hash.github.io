Let \\(\Gamma\\) be a countable group acting on a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic
metric space \\(X\\) and \\(\mu\\) a probability measure on \\(\Gamma\\) whose support
generates a non-elementary subsemigroup. Under the assumption that \\(\mu\\) has a
finite exponential moment, we establish large deviations results for the
distance and the translation length of a random walk with driving measure
\\(\mu\\). From our results, we deduce a special case of a conjecture regarding
large deviations of spectral radii of random matrix products.
