We propose to jointly learn multi-view geometry and warping between views of
the same object instances for robust cross-view object detection. What makes
multi-view object instance detection difficult are strong changes in viewpoint,
lighting conditions, high similarity of neighbouring objects, and strong
variability in scale. By turning object detection and instance
re-identification in different views into a joint learning task, we are able to
incorporate both image appearance and geometric soft constraints into a single,
multi-view detection process that is learnable end-to-end. We validate our
method on a new, large data set of street-level panoramas of urban objects and
show superior performance compared to various baselines. Our contribution is
threefold: a large-scale, publicly available data set for multi-view instance
detection and re-identification; an annotation tool custom-tailored for
multi-view instance detection; and a novel, holistic multi-view instance
detection and re-identification method that jointly models geometry and
appearance across views.
