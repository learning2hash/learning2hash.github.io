The word mover's distance (WMD) is a popular semantic similarity metric for
two texts. This position paper studies several possible extensions of WMD. We
experiment with the frequency of words in the corpus as a weighting factor and
the geometry of the word vector space. We validate possible extensions of WMD
on six document classification datasets. Some proposed extensions show better
results in terms of the k-nearest neighbor classification error than WMD.
