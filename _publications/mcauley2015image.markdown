Humans inevitably develop a sense of the relationships between objects, some
of which are based on their appearance. Some pairs of objects might be seen as
being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may
be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt).
This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying
clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human
sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our
approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather
on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for
uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a
network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a
large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we
develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well
together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.
