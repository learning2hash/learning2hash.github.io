Fine-grained image recognition is a challenging computer vision problem, due
to the small inter-class variations caused by highly similar subordinate
categories, and the large intra-class variations in poses, scales and
rotations. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Mask-CNN model without
the fully connected layers for fine-grained recognition. Based on the part
annotations of fine-grained images, the proposed model consists of a fully
convolutional network to both locate the discriminative parts (e.g., head and
torso), and more importantly generate object/part masks for selecting useful
and meaningful convolutional descriptors. After that, a four-stream Mask-CNN
model is built for aggregating the selected object- and part-level descriptors
simultaneously. The proposed Mask-CNN model has the smallest number of
parameters, lowest feature dimensionality and highest recognition accuracy when
compared with state-of-the-arts fine-grained approaches.
