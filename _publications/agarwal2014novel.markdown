Trademark Image Retrieval is playing a vital role as a part of CBIR System.
Trademark is of great significance because it carries the status value of any
company. To retrieve such a fake or copied trademark we design a retrieval
system which is based on hybrid techniques. It contains a mixture of two
different feature vector which combined together to give a suitable retrieval
system. In the proposed system we extract the corner feature which is applied
on an edge pixel image. This feature is used to extract the relevant image and
to more purify the result we apply other feature which is the invariant moment
feature. From the experimental result we conclude that the system is 85 percent
efficient.
