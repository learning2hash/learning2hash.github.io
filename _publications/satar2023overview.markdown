Text-video retrieval contains various challenges, including biases coming
from diverse sources. We highlight some of them supported by illustrations to
open a discussion. Besides, we address one of the biases, frame length bias,
with a simple method which brings a very incremental but promising increase. We
conclude with future directions.
