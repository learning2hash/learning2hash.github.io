We propose a visualization technique that utilizes neural network embeddings
and a generative network to reconstruct original data. This method allows for
independent manipulation of individual image embeddings through its
non-parametric structure, providing more flexibility than traditional
autoencoder approaches. We have evaluated the effectiveness of this technique
in data visualization and compared it to t-SNE and VAE methods. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated the scalability of our method through visualizations on the
ImageNet dataset. Our technique has potential applications in human-in-the-loop
training, as it allows for independent editing of embedding locations without
affecting the optimization process.
