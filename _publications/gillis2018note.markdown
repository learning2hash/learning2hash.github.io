Consider a discrete-time linear time-invariant descriptor system
\\(Ex(k+1)=Ax(k)\\) for \\(k \in \mathbb Z_\{+\}\\). In this paper, we tackle for the
first time the problem of stabilizing such systems by computing a nearby
regular index one stable system \\(\hat E x(k+1)= \hat A x(k)\\) with
\\(\text\{rank\}(\hat E)=r\\). We reformulate this highly nonconvex problem into an
equivalent optimization problem with a relatively simple feasible set onto
which it is easy to project. This allows us to employ a block coordinate
descent method to obtain a nearby regular index one stable system. We
illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on several examples.
