The method of random projections has become very popular for large-scale applications in statistical learning information retrieval bio-informatics and other applications. Using a well-designed coding scheme for the projected data which determines the number of bits needed for each projected value and how to allocate these bits can significantly improve the effectiveness of the algorithm in storage cost as well as computational speed. In this paper we study a number of simple coding schemes focusing on the task of similarity estimation and on an application to training linear classifiers. We demonstrate that uniform quantization outperforms the standard existing influential method (Datar et. al. 2004). Indeed we argue that in many cases coding with just a small number of bits suffices. Furthermore we also develop a non-uniform 2-bit coding scheme that generally performs well in practice as confirmed by our experiments on training linear support vector machines (SVM).
