Word similarity computation is a widely recognized task in the field of
lexical semantics. Most proposed tasks test on similarity of word pairs of
single morpheme, while few works focus on words of two morphemes or more
morphemes. In this work, we propose COS960, a benchmark dataset with 960 pairs
of Chinese wOrd Similarity, where all the words have two morphemes in three
Part of Speech (POS) tags with their human annotated similarity rather than
relatedness. We give a detailed description of dataset construction and
annotation process, and test on a range of word embedding models. The dataset
of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/COS960.
