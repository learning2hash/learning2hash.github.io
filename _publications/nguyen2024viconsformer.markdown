Text-based VQA is a challenging task that requires machines to use scene
texts in given images to yield the most appropriate answer for the given
question. The main challenge of text-based VQA is exploiting the meaning and
information from scene texts. Recent studies tackled this challenge by
considering the spatial information of scene texts in images via embedding 2D
coordinates of their bounding boxes. In this study, we follow the definition of
meaning from linguistics to introduce a novel method that effectively exploits
the information from scene texts written in Vietnamese. Experimental results
show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results on two
large-scale Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets. The implementation can be found
at this link.
