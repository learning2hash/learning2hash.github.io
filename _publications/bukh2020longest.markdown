We consider the expected length of the longest common subsequence between two
random words of lengths \(n\) and \((1-\epsilon)kn\) over \(k\)-symbol alphabet.
It is well-known that this quantity is asymptotic to \(\gamma_\{k,\epsilon\} n\)
for some constant \(\gamma_\{k,\epsilon\}\). We show that
\(\gamma_\{k,\epsilon\}\) is of the order \(1-c\epsilon^2\) uniformly in \(k\)
and \(\epsilon\). In addition, for large \(k\), we give evidence that
\(\gamma_\{k,\epsilon\}\) approaches \(1-\tfrac\{1\}\{4\}\epsilon^2\), and prove a
matching lower bound.
