In order to study online hate speech, the availability of datasets containing
the linguistic phenomena of interest are of crucial importance. However, when
it comes to specific target groups, for example teenagers, collecting such data
may be problematic due to issues with consent and privacy restrictions.
Furthermore, while text-only datasets of this kind have been widely used,
limitations set by image-based social media platforms like Instagram make it
difficult for researchers to experiment with multimodal hate speech data. We
therefore developed CREENDER, an annotation tool that has been used in school
classes to create a multimodal dataset of images and abusive comments, which we
make freely available under Apache 2.0 license. The corpus, with Italian
comments, has been analysed from different perspectives, to investigate whether
the subject of the images plays a role in triggering a comment. We find that
users judge the same images in different ways, although the presence of a
person in the picture increases the probability to get an offensive comment.
