In this paper, we propose the distributed tree kernels (DTK) as a novel
method to reduce time and space complexity of tree kernels. Using a linear
complexity algorithm to compute vectors for trees, we embed feature spaces of
tree fragments in low-dimensional spaces where the kernel computation is
directly done with dot product. We show that DTKs are faster, correlate with
tree kernels, and obtain a statistically similar performance in two natural
language processing tasks.
