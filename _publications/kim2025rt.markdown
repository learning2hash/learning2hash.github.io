The Hausdorff distance is a fundamental metric with widespread applications
across various fields. However, its computation remains computationally
expensive, especially for large-scale datasets. In this work, we present
RT-HDIST, the first Hausdorff distance algorithm accelerated by ray-tracing
cores (RT-cores). By reformulating the Hausdorff distance problem as a series
of nearest-neighbor searches and introducing a novel quantized index space,
RT-HDIST achieves significant reductions in computational overhead while
maintaining exact results. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate up to a
two-order-of-magnitude speedup over prior state-of-the-art methods,
underscoring RT-HDIST's potential for real-time and large-scale applications.
