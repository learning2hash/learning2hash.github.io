Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been promising for many computer
vision problems due to their powerful capabilities to enhance the data for
training and test. In this paper, we leveraged GANs and proposed a new
architecture with a cascaded Single Shot Detector (SSD) for pedestrian
detection at distance, which is yet a challenge due to the varied sizes of
pedestrians in videos at distance. To overcome the low-resolution issues in
pedestrian detection at distance, DCGAN is employed to improve the resolution
first to reconstruct more discriminative features for a SSD to detect objects
in images or videos. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a
multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under
one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts
of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the
effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the
Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was
demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better
detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it
highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects
or pedestrians at distance.
