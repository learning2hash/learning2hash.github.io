Main characters in images are the most important humans that catch the
viewer's attention upon first look, and they are emphasized by properties such
as size, position, color saturation, and sharpness of focus. Identifying the
main character in images plays an important role in traditional photographic
studies and media analysis, but the task is performed manually and can be slow
and laborious. Furthermore, selection of main characters can be sometimes
subjective. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of solving the main
character recognition needed for photographic studies automatically and propose
a method for identifying the main characters. The proposed method uses machine
learning based human pose estimation along with traditional computer vision
approaches for this task. We approach the task as a binary classification
problem where each detected human is classified either as a main character or
not. To evaluate both the subjectivity of the task and the performance of our
method, we collected a dataset of 300 varying images from multiple sources and
asked five people, a photographic researcher and four other persons, to
annotate the main characters. Our analysis showed a relatively high agreement
between different annotators. The proposed method achieved a promising F1 score
of 0.83 on the full image set and 0.96 on a subset evaluated as most clear and
important cases by the photographic researcher.
