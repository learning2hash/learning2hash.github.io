Given a query on the PASCAL database maintained by the INIST, we design user
interfaces to visualize and browse two types of graphs extracted from
abstracts: 1) the graph of all associations between authors (co-author graph),
2) the graph of strong associations between authors and terms automatically
extracted from abstracts and grouped using linguistic variations. We adapt for
this purpose the TermWatch system that comprises a term extractor, a relation
identifier which yields the terminological network and a clustering module. The
results are output on two interfaces: a graphic one mapping the clusters in a
2D space and a terminological hypertext network allowing the user to
interactively explore results and return to source texts.
