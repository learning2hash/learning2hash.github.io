We perform spatio-temporal analysis of public sentiment using geotagged photo
collections. We develop a deep learning-based classifier that predicts the
emotion conveyed by an image. This allows us to associate sentiment with place.
We perform spatial hotspot detection and show that different emotions have
distinct spatial distributions that match expectations. We also perform
temporal analysis using the capture time of the photos. Our spatio-temporal
hotspot detection correctly identifies emerging concentrations of specific
emotions and year-by-year analyses of select locations show there are strong
temporal correlations between the predicted emotions and known events.
