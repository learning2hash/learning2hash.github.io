Finding similar images is a necessary operation in many multimedia
applications. Images are often represented and stored as a set of
high-dimensional features, which are extracted using localized feature
extraction algorithms. Locality Sensitive Hashing is one of the most popular
approximate processing techniques for finding similar points in
high-dimensional spaces. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants are
designed to find similar points, but they are not designed to find objects
(such as images, which are made up of a collection of points) efficiently. In
this paper, we propose an index structure, Bitmap-Image LSH (bImageLSH), for
efficient processing of high-dimensional images. Using a real dataset, we
experimentally show the performance benefit of our novel design while keeping
the accuracy of the image results high.
