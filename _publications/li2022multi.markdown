In this paper, we present the Multi-Forgery Detection Challenge held
concurrently with the IEEE Computer Society Workshop on Biometrics at CVPR
2022. Our Multi-Forgery Detection Challenge aims to detect automatic image
manipulations including but not limited to image editing, image synthesis,
image generation, image photoshop, etc. Our challenge has attracted 674 teams
from all over the world, with about 2000 valid result submission counts. We
invited the Top 10 teams to present their solutions to the challenge, from
which three teams are awarded prizes in the grand finale. In this paper, we
present the solutions from the Top 3 teams, in order to boost the research work
in the field of image forgery detection.
