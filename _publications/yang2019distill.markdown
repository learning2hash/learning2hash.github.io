Due to the high storage and search efficiency, hashing
has become prevalent for large-scale similarity search. Particularly, deep hashing methods have greatly improved the
search performance under supervised scenarios. In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve
satisfactory performance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals.
 To address this issue, we propose
a novel deep unsupervised hashing model, dubbed DistillHash, which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data
pairs, which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial
noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and
the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal
classifier. We show that under a mild assumption, some
data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier, can be potentially
distilled. Inspired by this fact, we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further
adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the
proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the stateof-the-art search performance.
