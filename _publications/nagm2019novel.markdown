Digital Photo images are everywhere around us in journals, on walls, and over
the Internet. However we have to be conscious that seeing does not always imply
reality. Photo images become a rich subject of manipulations due to the
advanced digital cameras as well as photo editing software. Accordingly, image
forgery is becoming much easier using the existing tools in terms of time and
accuracy, and thus the forensics of detecting an image forgery case is becoming
difficult and needs more and more time and techniques to prove the image
originality especially as crime evidences and court related cases. In this
paper, a framework with associated algorithms and methodologies is proposed to
ensure the authenticity of the image and the integrity of the content in
addition to protecting the photo image against forgery suspects. The framework
depends on developing new generation of certified digital cameras that could
produce authenticated and forgery-proof photos. The proposed methodology
generates an irreversible hash integrity code from the image content based on
color matrix calculations and steganography algorithms. The simulation results
proved the capability of the proposed technique to detect image forgery cases
in more than 16 scenarios of manipulation.
