We investigate how well CLIP understands texture in natural images described
by natural language. To this end, we analyze CLIP's ability to: (1) perform
zero-shot learning on various texture and material classification datasets; (2)
represent compositional properties of texture such as red dots or yellow
stripes on the Describable Texture in Detail(DTDD) dataset; and (3) aid
fine-grained categorization of birds in photographs described by color and
texture of their body parts.
