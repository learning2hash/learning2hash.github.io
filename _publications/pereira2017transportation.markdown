In the last years researchers in the field of intelligent transportation
systems have made several efforts to extract valuable information from social
media streams. However, collecting domain-specific data from any social media
is a challenging task demanding appropriate and robust classification methods.
In this work we focus on exploring geo-located tweets in order to create a
travel-related tweet classifier using a combination of bag-of-words and word
embeddings. The resulting classification makes possible the identification of
interesting spatio-temporal relations in S\~ao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
