Let \(X=\\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\\} \subset \mathbb R^d\) be an \(n\)-element point set in
general position. For a \(k\)-element subset \(\\{x_\{i_1\},\ldots,x_\{i_k\}\\} \subset
X\) let the degree \(\{\rm deg\}_k(x_\{i_1\},\ldots,x_\{i_k\})\) be the number of empty
simplices \(\\{x_\{i_1\},\ldots,x_\{i_\{d+1\}\}\\} \subset X\) containing no other point
of \(X\). The \(k\)-degree of the set \(X\), denoted \(\{\rm deg\}_k(X)\), is defined as
the maximum degree over all \(k\)-element subset of \(X\).
  We show that if \(X\) is a random point set consisting of \(n\) independently and
uniformly chosen points from a compact set \(K\) then \(\{\rm deg\}_d(X)=\Theta(n)\),
improving results previously obtained by B\'ar\'any, Marckert and Reitzner
[Many empty triangles have a common edge, Discrete Comput. Geom., 2013] and
Temesvari [Moments of the maximal number of empty simplices of a random point
set, Discrete Comput. Geom., 2018] and giving the correct order of magnitude
with a significantly simpler proof. Furthermore, we investigate \(\{\rm
deg\}_k(X)\). In the case \(k=1\) we prove that \(\{\rm deg\}_1(X)=\Theta(n^\{d-1\})\).
