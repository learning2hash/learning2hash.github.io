We show that the Gaussian kernel \(\exp\left\\{-\lambda d_g^2(\bullet,
\bullet)\right\\}\) on any non-simply-connected closed Riemannian manifold
\((\mathcal\{M\},g)\), where \(d_g\) is the geodesic distance, is not positive
definite for any \(\lambda > 0\), combining analyses in the recent preprint~[9]
by Da Costa--Mostajeran--Ortega and classical comparison theorems in Riemannian
geometry.
