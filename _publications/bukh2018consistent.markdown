We consider incidences among colored sets of lines in \(\mathbb\{R\}^d\) and
examine whether the existence of certain concurrences between lines of \(k\)
colors force the existence of at least one concurrence between lines of \(k+1\)
colors. This question is relevant for problems in 3D reconstruction in computer
vision.
