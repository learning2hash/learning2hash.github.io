We derive a general lower bound for the generalized Hamming weights of nested
matrix-product codes, with a particular emphasis on the cases with two and
three constituent codes. We also provide an upper bound which is reminiscent of
the bounds used for the minimum distance of matrix-product codes. When the
constituent codes are two Reed-Solomon codes, we obtain an explicit formula for
the generalized Hamming weights of the resulting matrix-product code. We also
deal with the non-nested case for the case of two constituent codes.
