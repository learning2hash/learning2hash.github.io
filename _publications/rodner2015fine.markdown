In the following paper, we present and discuss challenging applications for
fine-grained visual classification (FGVC): biodiversity and species analysis.
We not only give details about two challenging new datasets suitable for
computer vision research with up to 675 highly similar classes, but also
present first results with localized features using convolutional neural
networks (CNN). We conclude with a list of challenging new research directions
in the area of visual classification for biodiversity research.
