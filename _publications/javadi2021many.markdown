The portrayal of negative emotions such as anger can vary widely between cultures and contexts, depending on the acceptability of expressing full-blown emotions rather than suppression to maintain harmony. The majority of emotional datasets collect data under the broad label ``anger, but social signals can range from annoyed, contemptuous, angry, furious, hateful, and more. In this work, we curated the first in-the-wild multicultural video dataset of emotions, and deeply explored anger-related emotional expressions by asking culture-fluent annotators to label the videos with 6 labels and 13 emojis in a multi-label framework. We provide a baseline multi-label classifier on our dataset, and show how emojis can be effectively used as a language-agnostic tool for annotation.
