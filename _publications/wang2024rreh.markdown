Known for efficient computation and easy storage hashing has been extensively explored in cross45;modal retrieval. The majority of current hashing models are predicated on the premise of a direct one45;to45;one mapping between data points. However in real practice data correspondence across modalities may be partially provided. In this research we introduce an innovative unsupervised hashing technique designed for semi45;paired cross45;modal retrieval tasks named Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing (RREH). RREH assumes that multi45;modal data share a common subspace. For paired data RREH explores the latent consistent information of heterogeneous modalities by seeking a shared representation. For unpaired data to effectively capture the latent discriminative features the high45;order relationships between unpaired data and anchors are embedded into the latent subspace which are computed by efficient linear reconstruction. The anchors are sampled from paired data which improves the efficiency of hash learning. The RREH trains the underlying features and the binary encodings in a unified framework with high45;order reconstruction relations preserved. With the well devised objective function and discrete optimization algorithm RREH is designed to be scalable making it suitable for large45;scale datasets and facilitating efficient cross45;modal retrieval. In the evaluation process the proposed is tested with partially paired data to establish its superiority over several existing methods.
