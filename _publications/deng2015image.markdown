Conventional single image based localization methods usually fail to localize
a querying image when there exist large variations between the querying image
and the pre-built scene. To address this, we propose an image-set querying
based localization approach. When the localization by a single image fails to
work, the system will ask the user to capture more auxiliary images. First, a
local 3D model is established for the querying image set. Then, the pose of the
querying image set is estimated by solving a nonlinear optimization problem,
which aims to match the local 3D model against the pre-built scene. Experiments
have shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.
