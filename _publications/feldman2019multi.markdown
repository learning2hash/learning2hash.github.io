This paper is concerned with the task of multi-hop open-domain Question
Answering (QA). This task is particularly challenging since it requires the
simultaneous performance of textual reasoning and efficient searching. We
present a method for retrieving multiple supporting paragraphs, nested amidst a
large knowledge base, which contain the necessary evidence to answer a given
question. Our method iteratively retrieves supporting paragraphs by forming a
joint vector representation of both a question and a paragraph. The retrieval
is performed by considering contextualized sentence-level representations of
the paragraphs in the knowledge source. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance over two well-known datasets, SQuAD-Open and HotpotQA, which serve
as our single- and multi-hop open-domain QA benchmarks, respectively.
