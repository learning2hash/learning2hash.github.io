Rapid increase of digitized document give birth to high demand of document
image retrieval. While conventional document image retrieval approaches depend
on complex OCR-based text recognition and text similarity detection, this paper
proposes a new content-based approach, in which more attention is paid to
features extraction and fusion. In the proposed approach, multiple features of
document images are extracted by different CNN models. After that, the
extracted CNN features are reduced and fused into weighted average feature.
Finally, the document images are ranked based on feature similarity to a
provided query image. Experimental procedure is performed on a group of
document images that transformed from academic papers, which contain both
English and Chinese document, the results show that the proposed approach has
good ability to retrieve document images with similar text content, and the
fusion of CNN features can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy.
