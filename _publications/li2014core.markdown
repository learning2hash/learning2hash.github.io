The term CoRE kernel stands for correlation-resemblance kernel. In many applications (e.g. vision) the data are often high-dimensional sparse and non-binary. We propose two types of (nonlinear) CoRE kernels for non-binary sparse data and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new kernels through a classification experiment. CoRE kernels are simple with no tuning parameters. However training nonlinear kernel SVM can be (very) costly in time and memory and may not be suitable for truly large-scale industrial applications (e.g. search). In order to make the proposed CoRE kernels more practical we develop basic probabilistic hashing algorithms which transform nonlinear kernels into linear kernels.
