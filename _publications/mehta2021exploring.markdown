Lesion images are frequently taken in open-set settings. Because of this, the
image data generated is extremely varied in nature.It is difficult for a
convolutional neural network to find proper features and generalise well, as a
result content based image retrieval (CBIR) system for lesion images are
difficult to build. This paper explores this domain and proposes multiple
similarity measures which uses Style Loss and Dice Coefficient via a novel
similarity measure called I1-Score. Out of the CBIR similarity measures
proposed, pure style loss approach achieves a remarkable accuracy increase over
traditional approaches like Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity. The
I1-Scores using style loss performed better than traditional approaches by a
small margin, whereas, I1-Scores with dice-coefficient faired very poorly. The
model used is trained using ensemble learning for better generalization.
