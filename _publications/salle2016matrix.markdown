In this paper, we propose LexVec, a new method for generating distributed
word representations that uses low-rank, weighted factorization of the Positive
Point-wise Mutual Information matrix via stochastic gradient descent, employing
a weighting scheme that assigns heavier penalties for errors on frequent
co-occurrences while still accounting for negative co-occurrence. Evaluation on
word similarity and analogy tasks shows that LexVec matches and often
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on many of these tasks.
