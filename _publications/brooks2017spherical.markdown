This paper introduces Multi45;Level Spherical LSH parameter45;free a multi45;level data45;dependant Locality Sensitive Hashing data structure for solving the Approximate Near Neighbors Problem (ANN). This data structure uses a modified version of a multi45;probe adaptive querying algorithm with the potential of achieving a O(n^p + t) query run time for all inputs n where t <= n.
