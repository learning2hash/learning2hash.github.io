Texture is an important cue for different computer vision tasks and
applications. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is considered one of the best yet
efficient texture descriptors. However, LBP has some notable limitations,
mostly the sensitivity to noise. In this paper, we address these criteria by
introducing a novel texture descriptor, Robust Adaptive Median Binary Pattern
(RAMBP). RAMBP based on classification process of noisy pixels, adaptive
analysis window, scale analysis and image regions median comparison. The
proposed method handles images with high noisy textures, and increases the
discriminative properties by capturing microstructure and macrostructure
texture information. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular texture
datasets for classification and retrieval tasks, and under different high noise
conditions. Without any train or prior knowledge of noise type, RAMBP achieved
the best classification compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It scored more
than \\(90%\\) under \\(50%\\) impulse noise densities, more than \\(95%\\) under
Gaussian noised textures with standard deviation \\(\sigma = 5\\), and more than
\\(99%\\) under Gaussian blurred textures with standard deviation \\(\sigma = 1.25\\).
The proposed method yielded competitive results and high performance as one of
the best descriptors in noise-free texture classification. Furthermore, RAMBP
showed also high performance for the problem of noisy texture retrieval
providing high scores of recall and precision measures for textures with high
levels of noise.
