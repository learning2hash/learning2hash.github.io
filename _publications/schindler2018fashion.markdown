We present an empirical study of applying deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) to the task of fashion and apparel image classification to improve
meta-data enrichment of e-commerce applications. Five different CNN
architectures were analyzed using clean and pre-trained models. The models were
evaluated in three different tasks person detection, product and gender
classification, on two small and large scale datasets.
