In the task of Object Recognition, there exists a dichotomy between the
categorization of objects and estimating object pose, where the former
necessitates a view-invariant representation, while the latter requires a
representation capable of capturing pose information over different categories
of objects. With the rise of deep architectures, the prime focus has been on
object category recognition. Deep learning methods have achieved wide success
in this task. In contrast, object pose regression using these approaches has
received relatively much less attention. In this paper we show how deep
architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), can be adapted
to the task of simultaneous categorization and pose estimation of objects. We
investigate and analyze the layers of various CNN models and extensively
compare between them with the goal of discovering how the layers of distributed
representations of CNNs represent object pose information and how this
contradicts with object category representations. We extensively experiment on
two recent large and challenging multi-view datasets. Our models achieve better
than state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.
