This paper describes a method for using Grovers algorithm to create a quantum
vector database, the database stores embeddings based on Controlled-S gates,
which represent a binary numerical value. This value represents the embeddings
value. The process of creating meaningful embeddings is handled by a classical
computer and the search process is handled by the quantum computer. This search
approach might be beneficial for a large enough database, or it could be seen
as a very qubit-efficient (super dense) way for storing data on a quantum
computer, since the proposed circuit stores many embeddings inside one quantum
register simultaneously.
