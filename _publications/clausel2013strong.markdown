In previous works, we proposed a method to characterize jointly
self-similarity and anisotropy properties of a large class of self--similar
Gaussian random fields. We provide here a mathematical analysis of our
approach, proving that the sharpest way of measuring smoothness is related to
these anisotropies and thus to the geometry of these fields.
