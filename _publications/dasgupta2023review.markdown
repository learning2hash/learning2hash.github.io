Extreme multi-label classification or XMLC, is an active area of interest in machine learning. Compared to traditional multi-label classification, here the number of labels is extremely large, hence, the name extreme multi-label classification. Using classical one-versus-all classification does not scale in this case due to large number of labels; the same is true for any other classifier. Embedding labels and features into a lower-dimensional space is a common first step in many XMLC methods. Moreover, other issues include existence of head and tail labels, where tail labels are those that occur in a relatively small number of samples. The existence of tail labels creates issues during embedding. This area has invited application of wide range of approaches ranging from bit compression motivated from compressed sensing, tree based embeddings, deep learning based latent space embedding including using attention weights, linear algebra based embeddings such as SVD, clustering, hashing, to name a few. The community has come up with a useful set of metrics to identify correctly the prediction for head or tail labels.
