Few-shot deep learning is a topical challenge area for scaling visual
recognition to open ended growth of unseen new classes with limited labeled
examples. A promising approach is based on metric learning, which trains a deep
embedding to support image similarity matching. Our insight is that effective
general purpose matching requires non-linear comparison of features at multiple
abstraction levels. We thus propose a new deep comparison network comprised of
embedding and relation modules that learn multiple non-linear distance metrics
based on different levels of features simultaneously. Furthermore, to reduce
over-fitting and enable the use of deeper embeddings, we represent images as
distributions rather than vectors via learning parameterized Gaussian noise
regularization. The resulting network achieves excellent performance on both
miniImageNet and tieredImageNet.
