For a second-order particle system in \\(\mathbb R^d\\) subject to
locally-in-space pairwise annihilation, we prove a scaling limit for its
empirical measure on position and velocity towards a degenerate elliptic
partial differential equation. Crucial ingredients are Green's function
estimates for the associated hypoelliptic operator and an It\^o-Tanaka trick.
