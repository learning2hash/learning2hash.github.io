<p>Given positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(A_2(n,d)\)</span> denote the maximum size of a
binary code of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and minimum
distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The well-known
Gilbert-Varshamov bound asserts that <span
class="math inline">\(A_2(n,d) \geq 2^n/V(n,d-1)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(V(n,d) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} {n \choose i}\)</span> is
the volume of a Hamming sphere of radius <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. We show that, in fact, there exists a
positive constant <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[ A_2(n,d) \geq c \frac{2^n}{V(n,d-1)} \log_2
V(n,d-1) \]</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(d/n
\le 0.499\)</span>. The result follows by recasting the Gilbert-
Varshamov bound into a graph-theoretic framework and using the fact that
the corresponding graph is locally sparse. Generalizations and
extensions of this result are briefly discussed.</p>
