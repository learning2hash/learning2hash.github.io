Given positive integers (n) and (d) let (A_2(nd)) denote the maximum size of a binary code of length (n) and minimum distance (d). The well-known Gilbert-Varshamov bound asserts that (A_2(nd) geq 2^n/V(nd-1)) where (V(nd) = sum_i=0^d n choose i) is the volume of a Hamming sphere of radius (d). We show that in fact there exists a positive constant (c) such that () A_2(nd) geq c frac2^nV(nd-1) log_2 V(nd-1) () whenever d/n le 0.499. The result follows by recasting the Gilbert- Varshamov bound into a graph-theoretic framework and using the fact that the corresponding graph is locally sparse. Generalizations and extensions of this result are briefly discussed.
