Given positive integers \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, let \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A\_2(n,d)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} denote the maximum size of a binary code of length \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(n\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} and minimum distance \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. The well-known Gilbert-Varshamov bound asserts that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(A\_2(n,d) \geq 2^n/V(n,d-1)\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}, where \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(V(n,d) = \sum\_\{i=0\}^\{d\} \{n \choose i\}\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} is the volume of a Hamming sphere of radius \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(d\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\}. We show that, in fact, there exists a positive constant \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(c\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} such that \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} A\_2(n,d) \geq c \frac\{2^n\}\{V(n,d-1)\} \log\_2 V(n,d-1) \{&#37; raw &#37;\}\\(\\)\{&#37; endraw &#37;\} whenever $d/n \le 0.499$. The result follows by recasting the Gilbert- Varshamov bound into a graph-theoretic framework and using the fact that the corresponding graph is locally sparse. Generalizations and extensions of this result are briefly discussed.
