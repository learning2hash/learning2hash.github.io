Given positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(d\\), let \\(A_2(n,d)\\) denote the maximum size
of a binary code of length \\(n\\) and minimum distance \\(d\\). The well-known
Gilbert-Varshamov bound asserts that \\(A_2(n,d) \geq 2^n/V(n,d-1)\\), where
\\(V(n,d) = \sum_\{i=0\}^\{d\} \{n \choose i\}\\) is the volume of a Hamming sphere of
radius \\(d\\). We show that, in fact, there exists a positive constant \\(c\\) such
that $\\( A_2(n,d) \geq c \frac\{2^n\}\{V(n,d-1)\} log_2 V(n,d-1) \\)\\( whenever \\)d/n
\le 0.499$. The result follows by recasting the Gilbert- Varshamov bound into a
graph-theoretic framework and using the fact that the corresponding graph is
locally sparse. Generalizations and extensions of this result are briefly
discussed.
