The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as consisting of c=O(1) characters e.g. a 64-bit key as c=8 characters of 8-bits. The character domain Sigma should be small enough that character tables of size Sigma fit in fast cache. The schemes then use O(1) tables of this size so the space of tabulation hashing is O(Sigma). However the concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are ll Sigma. To see the problem consider the very simple case where we use tabulation hashing to throw n balls into m bins and want to analyse the number of balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds we are fine if n=m for then the expected value is 1. However if m=2 as when tossing n unbiased coins the expected value n/2 is gg Sigma for large data sets e.g. data sets that do not fit in fast cache. To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space we need a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation plus a new tabulation technique that we call hashing which is at most twice as slow as simple tabulation.

Important examples of this approach are small space algorithms for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream or estimating the set similarity between large sets. Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each element we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large error is say 1/4. By performing r independent repetitions and taking the median of the estimators the error probability falls exponentially in r. However running r independent experiments increases the processing time by a factor r. Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong concentration bounds then we get the same high probability bounds without any need for repetitions. Instead of r independent sketches we have a single sketch that is r times bigger so the total space is the same. However we only apply a single hash function so we save a factor r in time and the overall algorithms just get simpler. Fast practical hash functions with strong concentration bounds were recently proposed by Aamand em et al. (to appear in STOC 2020).

Iceberg hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to 1 - o(1) while being stable meaning that the position where an element is stored only ever changes when resizes occur. In fact in the setting where keys are Theta(log n) bits the space guarantees that Iceberg hashing offers namely that it uses at most log n + O(n log log n) bits to store n items from a universe U matches a lower bound by Demaine et al. that applies to any stable hash table. Iceberg hashing introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the most basic aspects of hash-table design. Notably our indirection-free technique for dynamic resizing which we call waterfall addressing and our techniques for achieving stability and very-high probability guarantees can be applied to any hash table that makes use of the front-yard/backyard paradigm for hash table design.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"], "tsne_embedding": [-32.9621696472168, 7.253894329071045]}, {"key": "bender2021on", "year": "2021", "title": "On the Optimal Time/Space Tradeoff for Hash Tables", "abstract": "<p>For nearly six decades the central open question in the study of hash tables has been to determine the optimal achievable tradeoff curve between time and space. State-of-the-art hash tables offer the following guarantee If keys/values are Theta(log n) bits each then it is possible to achieve constant-time insertions/deletions/queries while wasting only O(loglog n) bits of space per key when compared to the information-theoretic optimum. Even prior to this bound being achieved the target of O(loglog n) wasted bits per key was known to be a natural end goal and was proven to be optimal for a number of closely related problems (e.g. stable hashing dynamic retrieval and dynamically-resized filters). This paper shows that O(loglog n) wasted bits per key is not the end of the line for hashing. In fact for any k in log n it is possible to achieve O(k)-time insertions/deletions O(1)-time queries and O(log^(k) n) wasted bits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that each time we increase insertion/deletion time by an we reduce the wasted bits per key .

To this end we present tornado tabulation hashing which is simple fast and exhibits a certain full local randomness property that provably makes diverse algorithms perform almost as if (abstract) fully-random hashing was used. For example this includes classic linear probing the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet Fusy Gandouet Meunier AOFA 97 for counting distinct elements and the one-permutation hashing of Li Owen and Zhang NIPS 12 for large-scale machine learning.

As a consequence transfer retrieval performance within Hamming Radius 2 degrades significantly in existing hashing methods. This paper presents Transfer Adversarial Hashing (TAH) a new hybrid deep architecture that incorporates a pairwise t-distribution cross-entropy loss to learn concentrated hash codes and an adversarial network to align the data distributions between the source and target domains. TAH can generate compact transfer hash codes for efficient image retrieval on both source and target domains.

Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient.

Due to the petabyte scale of genome archives most gene search systems now use hashing-based data structures such as Bloom Filters (BF). The state-of-the-art systems such as Compact bit-slicing signature index (COBS) and Repeated And Merged Bloom filters (RAMBO) use BF with Random Hash (RH) functions for gene representation and identification. The standard recipe is to cast the gene search problem as a sequence of membership problems testing if each subsequent gene substring (called kmer) of Q is present in the set of kmers of the entire gene database D. We observe that RH functions which are crucial to the memory and the computational advantage of BF are also detrimental to the system performance of gene-search systems. While subsequent kmers being queried are likely very similar RH oblivious to any similarity uniformly distributes the kmers to different parts of potentially large BF thus triggering excessive cache misses and causing system slowdown. We propose a novel hash function called the Identity with Locality (IDL) hash family which co-locates the keys close in input space without causing collisions. This approach ensures both cache locality and key preservation. IDL functions can be a drop-in replacement for RH functions and help improve the performance of information retrieval systems. We give a simple but practical construction of IDL function families and show that replacing the RH with IDL functions reduces cache misses by a factor of 5x thus improving query and indexing times of SOTA methods such as COBS and RAMBO by factors up to 2x without compromising their quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the false positive rate of BF with IDL functions.

We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions.

The straightforward answer to this problem is to compare the query with all items in the dataset but this is practical only for small datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the nearest neighbors. However if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance then the main issue is that the order of buckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue we first elaborate on the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table. However solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only practical for short binary codes. To address this issue we propose the angular multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash tables on binary code substrings.

However such approximation leads to uncertainty between real-values and binary ones degrading retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH).

Further we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the load-factor. Lastly we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of value lookups. Given the above HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs though HashGraph is not architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU HashGraph is anywhere from 2X-8X faster than cuDPP WarpDrive and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the same rate.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Graph"], "tsne_embedding": [-29.75371742248535, 6.41569709777832]}, {"key": "grossi2011fast", "year": "2011", "title": "Fast Compressed Tries through Path Decompositions", "abstract": "<p>Tries are popular data structures for storing a set of strings where common prefixes are represented by common root-to-node paths.

A common approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors denoted which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes compared to real-valued representations a core open challenge is how to generate hash codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small number of bits while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use representation learning for generating such hash codes focusing on neural autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than the current state of the art namely the Hamming distance and (ii) improve efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited to the choice of search method.

The state of the art has primarily focused on learning hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness while assuming a brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes even though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index hashing an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH) an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing while being end-to-end trainable. In fact our proposed training objectives are model agnostic i.e. not tied to how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH and are straight-forward to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan they are still upwards of 33 slower than MISH while MISH is still able to obtain state-of-the-art effectiveness.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Supervised", "Unsupervised"], "tsne_embedding": [-11.004213333129883, -9.79210376739502]}, {"key": "harandi2014expanding", "year": "2014", "title": "Expanding the Family of Grassmannian Kernels An Embedding Perspective", "abstract": "<p>Modeling videos and image-sets as linear subspaces has proven beneficial for many visual recognition tasks.

However the inference delay has become increasingly difficult to overlook. Knowledge distillation provides a means for practical model compression to alleviate this delay. Nevertheless the prevailing knowledge distillation approaches are not explicitly designed for semantic hashing. They ignore the unique search paradigm of semantic hashing the inherent necessities of the distillation process and the property of hash codes. In this paper we propose an innovative Bit-mask Robust Contrastive knowledge Distillation (BRCD) method specifically devised for the distillation of semantic hashing models. To ensure the effectiveness of two kinds of search paradigms in the context of semantic hashing BRCD first aligns the semantic spaces between the teacher and student models through a contrastive knowledge distillation objective. Additionally to eliminate noisy augmentations and ensure robust optimization a cluster-based method within the knowledge distillation process is introduced. Furthermore through a bit-level analysis we uncover the presence of redundancy bits resulting from the bit independence property. To mitigate these effects we introduce a bit mask mechanism in our knowledge distillation objective.

The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.</p>\n", "tags": ["ACL", "ARXIV", "Image Retrieval"], "tsne_embedding": [15.102116584777832, 7.540228366851807]}, {"key": "huang2017online", "year": "2017", "title": "Online Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Although hash function learning algorithms have achieved great success in recent years most existing hash models are off-line which are not suitable for processing sequential or online data.

In this paper we propose an alternative embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE) replacing embedding tables by a deep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly.

When pivot elements are computed using a 5-independent hash function Karloff and Raghavan J.ACM93 showed O ( n log n) expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort. We improve upon this showing that the same running time is achieved with only 4-independence. -Min-wise hashing. For a set A consider the probability of a particular element being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that 5-independence implies the optimal probability O (1 /n). Broder et al. STOC98 showed that 2-independence implies it is O(1 / ). We show a matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for 3- and 4-independent hash functions. -Largest bucket. We consider the case where n balls are distributed to n buckets using a k-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket size. Alon et. al STOC97 showed that there exists a 2-independent hash function implying a bucket of size Omega ( n^1/2). We generalize the bound providing a k-independent family of functions that imply size Omega ( n^1/k).</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"], "tsne_embedding": [-15.070898056030273, 29.652063369750977]}, {"key": "knudsen2017linear", "year": "2017", "title": "Linear Hashing is Awesome", "abstract": "<p>We consider the hash function h(x) = ((ax+b) bmod p) bmod n where ab are chosen uniformly at random from 01ldotsp-1.

(b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g. 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However as online algorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context of search it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for them. This paper demonstrates that b-bit minwise hashing provides an effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process. This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g. 10 to 100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3.

The testing time can also be expensive if a new data point (e.g. a new document or image) has not been processed which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications. We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing. Conceptually given a massive binary data matrix we permute the columns only once and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store for each data vector the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The interesting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals that our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original (k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact the one permutation scheme can be even slightly more accurate due to the sample-without-replacement effect. Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the webspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can achieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original k-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method we also experiment with the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average 500 nonzeros in each data vector.

In particular we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important practical applications. For example in the task of near neighbor search a crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed coding scheme and estimator. As a related task in this paper we also study a simple uniform quantization scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For example when the target similarity level is high 2 or 3 bits might be sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high it is preferable to use only 1 or 2 bits.

Basically we develop a new densification method for OPH which achieves the smallest estimation variance compared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is named C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the existing structure of the data) C-OPH only needs a shorter permutation of length D/K (instead of D) where D is the original data dimension and K is the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in K bins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation variance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the existing (densified) OPH methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV"], "tsne_embedding": [-15.877930641174316, 29.934329986572266]}, {"key": "andoni2006near", "year": "2021", "title": "Deep Unsupervised Image Hashing by Maximizing Bit Entropy", "abstract": "<p>Unsupervised hashing is important for indexing huge image or video collections without having expensive annotations available.

We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities.

Without label information, however, unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH), which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part, we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part, a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore, the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes, hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework.

Model counting is a fundamental but hard problem in computer science with varied applications. Recent years have witnessed a surge of effort towards developing efficient algorithmic techniques that combine the classical 2-universal hashing with the remarkable progress in SAT solving over the past decade. These techniques augment the CNF formula F with random XOR constraints and invoke an NP oracle repeatedly on the resultant CNF-XOR formulas. In practice calls to the NP oracle calls are replaced a SAT solver whose runtime performance is adversely affected by size of XOR constraints. The standard construction of 2-universal hash functions chooses every variable with probability p = 1/2 leading to XOR constraints of size n/2 in expectation. Consequently the challenge is to design sparse hash functions where variables can be chosen with smaller probability and lead to smaller sized XOR constraints. In this paper we address this challenge from theoretical and practical perspectives. First we formalize a relaxation of universal hashing called concentrated hashing and establish a novel and beautiful connection between concentration measures of these hash functions and isoperimetric inequalities on boolean hypercubes. This allows us to obtain (log m) tight bounds on variance and dispersion index and show that p = O( log(m)/m ) suffices for design of sparse hash functions from 0 1^n to 0 1^m.

However due to the high-dimensional nature of image features that reduces the effectivity of index structures (curse of dimensionality) due to the vast amount of features stored in image databases (images are often represented by up to several thousand features) this ultimate goal demanded to trade query runtimes for query precision. In this paper we address an approach complementary to indexing in order to improve the runtimes of retrieval by querying only the most promising keypoint descriptors as this affects matching runtimes linearly and can therefore lead to increased efficiency. As this reduction of kNN queries reduces the number of tentative correspondences a loss of query precision is minimized by an additional image-level correspondence generation stage with a computational performance independent of the underlying indexing structure. We evaluate such an adaption of the standard recognition pipeline on a variety of datasets using both SIFT and state-of-the-art binary descriptors.

In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo hashing the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets.

However many systems retrieve data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively expensive process; but once a page is fetched its contents can be accessed orders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval presenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint each bucket must be fully contained in a single page but buckets are not necessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases memory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an item. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two the page size is 8 and each bucket is fully contained in a single page the memory utilization equals 89.71 in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant 93.78 in the contiguous overlapping bucket variant and increases to 97.46 in our new non-contiguous bucket variant.

Moreover the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage could come from similar but different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented which mainly consists of four components a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses i.e. adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately.

To ensure adaptability across different applications a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase.

However, all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix, ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one, i.e., the categories that samples do not belong to.

This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a saliency graph connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph that is its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image making the hash robust to image transformation yet distinct for different visual content.

In this research we introduce an innovative unsupervised hashing technique designed for semi-paired cross-modal retrieval tasks named Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing (RREH). RREH assumes that multi-modal data share a common subspace. For paired data RREH explores the latent consistent information of heterogeneous modalities by seeking a shared representation. For unpaired data to effectively capture the latent discriminative features the high-order relationships between unpaired data and anchors are embedded into the latent subspace which are computed by efficient linear reconstruction. The anchors are sampled from paired data which improves the efficiency of hash learning. The RREH trains the underlying features and the binary encodings in a unified framework with high-order reconstruction relations preserved. With the well devised objective function and discrete optimization algorithm RREH is designed to be scalable making it suitable for large-scale datasets and facilitating efficient cross-modal retrieval. In the evaluation process the proposed is tested with partially paired data to establish its superiority over several existing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["ARXIV", "Cross Modal", "Supervised", "Unsupervised"], "tsne_embedding": [-5.188408374786377, -3.739081382751465]}, {"key": "wang2024weakly", "year": "2024", "title": "Weakly Supervised Deep Hyperspherical Quantization for Image Retrieval", "abstract": "<p>Deep quantization methods have shown high efficiency on large-scale image retrieval.

This paper presents Approximate nearest neighbor Negative Contrastive Estimation (ANCE) a training mechanism that constructs negatives from an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index of the corpus which is parallelly updated with the learning process to select more realistic negative training instances. This fundamentally resolves the discrepancy between the data distribution used in the training and testing of DR.

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples.

We employ the dimensionality reduction that takes place in the intermediate layers of the discriminator network and train binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer to mimic the distribution of the higher-dimensional preceding layers. To achieve this we introduce two loss terms that aim at (i) reducing the correlation between the dimensions of the binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer i. e. maximizing joint entropy) and (ii) propagating the relations between the dimensions in the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional space.

Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels which we call unseen images zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper for the first time a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data. Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the competing methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Image Retrieval", "Quantisation"], "tsne_embedding": [6.728256702423096, -16.13595962524414]}, {"key": "zubarev2008wet", "year": "2008", "title": "Wet Paper Coding for Watermarking of Binary Images", "abstract": "<p>We propose a new method to embed data in binary images including scanned text figures and signatures.

It has recently been shown that variational autoencoders with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by neural nets can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and unsupervised scenarios improving on more traditional methods thanks to their ability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However the scenario where labels are scarce has not been studied yet. This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on variational autoencoders to the lack of supervision focusing on two semi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational autoencoders training objective to jointly model the distribution over the data and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to define an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the similarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space. Our experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash codes quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number of labelled points is large. However we found that this method degrades quickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent this problem we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its label distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to the best baseline this procedure yields similar performance in fully supervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data is scarce.
