To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem.

Due to its fast query speed and reduced storage\ncost, hashing has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor\nsearch in a large variety of applications like text and image retrieval.\nMost existing hashing methods adopt Hamming distance to\nmeasure the similarity (neighborhood) between points in the hashcode\nspace. However, one problem with Hamming distance is that\nit may destroy the neighborhood structure in the original feature\nspace, which violates the essential goal of hashing. In this paper,\nManhattan hashing (MH), which is based on Manhattan distance, is\nproposed to solve the problem of Hamming distance based hashing.\nThe basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with\nmultiple bits of natural binary code (NBC), based on which the\nManhattan distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated\nfor nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the\nneighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt Manhattan\ndistance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several largescale\nimage data sets containing up to one million points show that\nour MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art\nmethods.</p>\n", "tags": ["Quantisation", "Image Retrieval", "SIGIR"], "tsne_embedding": [7.09736442565918, -0.5165517926216125]}, {"key": "kong2012busing", "year": "2012", "title": "Double-Bit Quantisation for Hashing", "abstract": "<p>Hashing, which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary\ncodes for data representation, has been widely\nused for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive\ndatabases due to its fast query speed and low storage\ncost.

Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples.

Despite the great success achieved, unsupervised cross-modal hashing still suffers from lacking reliable similarity supervision and struggles with handling the heterogeneity issue between different modalities. To cope with these, in this paper, we devise a new deep hashing model, termed as High-order Nonlocal Hashing (HNH) to facilitate cross-modal retrieval with the following advantages. First, different from existing methods that mainly leverage low-level local-view similarity as the guidance for hashing learning, we propose a high-order affinity measure that considers the multi-modal neighbourhood structures from a nonlocal perspective, thereby comprehensively capturing the similarity relationships between data items. Second, a common representation is introduced to correlate different modalities. By enforcing the modal-specific descriptors and the common representation to be aligned with each other, the proposed HNH significantly bridges the modality gap and maintains the intra-consistency. Third, an effective affinity preserving objective function is delicately designed to generate high-quality binary codes. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of the proposed HNH in unsupervised cross-modal retrieval tasks over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>\n", "tags": ["WWW", "Unsupervised", "Cross-Modal"], "tsne_embedding": [2.4972288608551025, 0.26369452476501465]}, {"key": "zhao2015deep", "year": "2015", "title": "Deep Semantic Ranking Based Hashing for Multi-Label Image Retrieval", "abstract": "<p>With the rapid growth of web images, hashing has received\nincreasing interests in large scale image retrieval.\nResearch efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary\ncodes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels.\nHowever, most of these hashing methods are designed\nto handle simple binary similarity.
