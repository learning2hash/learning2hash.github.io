Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover the binary codes can be generated discretely reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset making it scalable to large-scale datasets.

To address this challenge we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically by exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional discrete space our method efficiently estimates a better variant of Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional Wasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude better sample complexity thus better generalization property compared to the other adversarial hashing methods. In addition the computational cost is significantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing methods achieving up to 1037; improvement over the current state-of-the-art image hashing methods.

Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stages continuous relaxation and the inference stages discrete quantization is important. However in the existing deep supervised hashing methods coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error.

Unfortunately all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality.

To mitigate this challenge different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem.

In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of using sparsity s greater than 1 in sparse JL on feature vectors. Our main result is a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for a general sparsity s that significantly generalizes the result of Freksen et. al. Our result theoretically demonstrates that sparse JL with s 1 can have significantly better norm-preservation properties on feature vectors than sparse JL with s = 1; we also empirically demonstrate this finding.</p>\n", "tags": ["ICML", "Independent", "NEURIPS"], "tsne_embedding": [-17.96360206604004, 4.218883514404297]}, {"key": "jain2008online", "year": "2008", "title": "Online Metric Learning And Fast Similarity Search", "abstract": "<p>Metric learning algorithms can provide useful distance functions for a variety of domains and recent work has shown good accuracy for problems where the learner can access all distance constraints at once.

The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identi- fied.

Compared with supervised methods unsupervised hashing methods are more reasonable and suitable for large-scale image retrieval since it is always difficult and expensive to collect true labels of the massive data. Without label information however unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH) which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. To solve the resulting optimization problem an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based iterative algorithm is elaborately designed.

This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time.

Specifically a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly our method can benefit from the semantic labels and simultaneously avoid the high computation complexity.

Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation.

Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images.

To address this problem we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference.
