The genre of music refers to multiple types and categorization of music. The different types of famous music genre that we widely known are rock, jazz, reggae, classical, folk, blues, R & B, metal, dubstep, techno, country music, electro and pop. The key success of music in music industry is the genres of classified music that becomes a significant part of communicating music that provides bonding with relatively to human and masses of people. In contrast, the genre that falls under top-level style of rock are punk, indie, shoegaze, AOR and metal. They are basically subgenre of a music classification and it is important describing music to other people. In practical life, music is often used for multiple purposes due to physiological and social effects.    Companies like Spotify, Soundcloud, Apple Music, Wynk & products like Shazam use music classification to provide their customers different flavour of music by recommending music they prefer to listen. we use python libraries such as Librosa and PyAudio library for audio processing in Python. We apply and use GTZAN dataset that is composed of 1000 audio tracks each 30-second-long representing 10 genres with 22050Hz mono audio file of 16bit in .au format for dataset. The functionality and working of music genre classification determine the help of Machine Learning algorithms.
