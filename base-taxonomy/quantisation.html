<h2>Binary Quantisation Models</h2>

<b>Quantisation models</b> Two main categories of quantisation have been proposed for nearest neighbour search: <em>scalar</em> and <em>vector</em> quantisation, which are differentiated by whether the input and output of the quantisation is a scalar or a vector quantity. This page lists models for scalar quantisation. Scalar quantisation is frequently applied to
quantise the real-values (projections) resulting from the dot product of the feature vector of each data-point onto the normal vectors to a set of hyperplanes partitioning the
feature space. Each dot product yields a scalar
value which is then subsequently quantised into binary (0/1) by thresholding. The resulting bits are concatenated to form the hashcode for a data-point.
