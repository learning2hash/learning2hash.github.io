## Unimodal and Cross-Modal Hashing Datasets

### Unimodal Datasets
**Unimodal** experiments, where both the query and database exist in the same feature space (e.g., images), are commonly conducted on six popular, freely available image datasets: **LabelMe**, **CIFAR-10**, **NUS-WIDE**, **MNIST**, **SIFT1M**, and **ImageNet**. These datasets vary greatly in size, ranging from 22,019 to 1.3 million images, and are represented by diverse feature descriptors like GIST, SIFT, RGB pixels, and bag-of-visual-words. The content spans a wide array of image topics, from natural scenes to personal photos, logos, and drawings, offering rich resources for unimodal hashing research.

### Cross-modal Datasets
**Cross-modal** retrieval experiments, where the query and database are in different feature spaces (e.g., image and text), are typically performed on the **Wiki**, **Microsoft COCO**, and **NUSWIDE** datasets. Each of these datasets includes images paired with textual descriptions, which are essential for training and evaluating cross-modal retrieval models.

Below is a list of key publications and their associated datasets:

{% assign publicationsList = site.data.morantaxonomy | sort: "bibkey" %}
<table id="reprModelTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Paper</th>
      <th>Dataset</th>
      <th>Modality</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Features</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for publication in publicationsList %}{% if publication.categories contains "dataset" %}
      {% assign pubDetails = site.publications | where:"bibkey", publication.bibkey %}
        <tr>
          <td data-order="{{publication.bibkey}}"><a href="/publications/{{publication.bibkey}}">{{pubDetails[0].authors}}, {{pubDetails[0].year}}.</a> {{pubDetails[0].title}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.name}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.modality}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.size}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.features}}</td>
        </tr>
    {% endif %}{% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
