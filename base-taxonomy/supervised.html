title: Supervised Hashing Models

<h2>Supervised Hashing Models</h2>

<b>Supervised Hashing Models</b> are models that leverage available semantic supervision in the form of, for example: class labels or must-link and cannot-link constraints between data-point pairs. The models exploit this supervision during the learning process to maximise the occurrence of related data-points being hashed to the same hashtable buckets. These models typically exhibit the highest retrieval effectiveness but suffer the disadvantage of requiring manual labels which can be challenging to collect.

{% assign publicationsList = site.data.morantaxonomy | sort: "bibkey" %}
<table id="genModelTable">
<thead><th>Name</th><th>Architecture</th><th>Modality</th></thead><tbody>
{% for publication in publicationsList %}{% if publication.categories contains "supervised" %}
    {% assign pubDetails = site.publications | where:"bibkey", publication.bibkey %}
    
      <tr>
          <td data-order="{{publication.bibkey}}"><a href="/publications/{{publication.bibkey}}">{{pubDetails[0].authors}}, {{pubDetails[0].year}}.</a> {{pubDetails[0].title}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.type}}</td>
          <td>{{publication.modality}}</td>
      </tr>
