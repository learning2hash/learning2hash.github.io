### Background: What is Learning to Hash?

At its core, *[Nearest Neighbour Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search)* is the task of finding the most similar data points to a given query in a large dataset. This operation is fundamental to many fields, from Bioinformatics to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.

Some notable applications include:

- **[Scalable Source Code Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04473)**: Using MinHash to enable code-to-code recommendations across large-scale source code repositories.
- **[Efficient Transformers](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkgNKkHtvB)**: Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) helps make large Transformer models more efficient, cutting down training costs.
- **[Social Media Event Tracking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-5007)**: A system for detecting and tracking interesting events on social media in real time using LSH.
- **[Earthquake Detection](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/09/05/quake/)**: Comparing time series of seismic activity to detect earthquakes using LSH.
- **[Fraud Detection at Uber](https://eng.uber.com/lsh/)**: Uber employs LSH to identify suspicious taxi rides based on spatial data.
- **[Audio Fingerprinting](https://santhoshhari.github.io/Locality-Sensitive-Hashing/)**: Matching a snippet of audio to a large database (think Shazam!) using learning-to-hash methods.
- **[Genomic Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26006009)**: Biologists use LSH to assemble genomes and find genes with similar expression profiles.
- **[Image Retrieval](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub34634)**: Google applies LSH along with [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) to index massive collections of images.
- **[Malware Detection](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf)**: Hash learning models help antivirus software quickly match code snippets to known viruses.

### How Learning to Hash Works

Learning to hash is about creating binary hash codes that capture the similarity between data points. These hash codes are then used to index data into hash tables, making it possible to quickly find similar items based on the query. 

For example, in the image below, the system generates a hashcode for an image of a tiger and compares it only to data points within the same hash table bucket. This method dramatically reduces the number of comparisons needed, making search faster than brute-force approaches. Although there‚Äôs a small trade-off in accuracy, the speed benefits are substantial in practice.
