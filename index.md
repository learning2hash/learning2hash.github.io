### 🤔 What is Learning to Hash?
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search">Nearest neighbour search</a> involves retrieving similar items from large datasets, often in high-dimensional spaces. <strong>Learning to Hash (L2H)</strong> enhances this process by learning compact representations—typically binary codes, but sometimes real-valued or quantized forms—that preserve semantic or structural similarity. These representations enable fast and memory-efficient approximate retrieval by avoiding exhaustive comparisons.
</p>

<p>
Learning to Hash techniques underpin a broad range of applications, including large-scale multimedia retrieval, recommendation systems, source code search, scientific data mining, and real-time anomaly detection.
</p>

### 🧩 How Hashing Works
<p>
Learning to hash involves training a model to encode data points into compact representations, often binary hash codes. These are used to index items into hash tables. During retrieval, only a subset of nearby buckets are examined, significantly reducing the search space compared to exhaustive nearest neighbour methods.
