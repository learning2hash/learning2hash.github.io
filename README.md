**Explore the field of Learning to Hash with structure and clarity.**  
A visual, searchable map of key papers on hashing methods, ANN search, quantization, and vector indexing.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

Learning to Hash is a foundational area in efficient similarity search, powering applications in large-scale retrieval, vision, and information systems.

But the literature is fragmented across subfields and venues. It’s hard to get a clear picture of the landscape.

**Learning to Hash** solves that by providing an **interactive, structured interface** to the field — with categories, tags, search, and taxonomy across modalities and methods.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **Taxonomy of methods:** Binary hashing, deep hashing, quantization, indexing, multimodal  
- 🔍 **Search:** Instantly find papers by title, authors, tags, or topics  
- 🧠 **Clustered tagging:** Group papers by supervision level, modality, and algorithmic approach  
- 🗂️ **Categorized views:** Hashing vs Quantization vs Indexing, clearly separated  
- 🚫 **No ads, no subscriptions — just structured research access**
