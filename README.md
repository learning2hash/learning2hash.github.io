## 📘 About

The *Learning to Hash* field powers fast similarity search, image retrieval, vector quantization, and efficient indexing. But the literature is vast and scattered.

This project brings it together in one place:
- 🧠 **Paper taxonomy** of key methods (binary hashing, deep hashing, quantization, etc.)
- 📅 **Chronological and clustered views** of foundational and recent papers
- 🧪 Highlighting methods by supervision type, modality, and algorithm class
- 🔍 Search and filter by technique, topic, or citation

---

## ✨ Features

- 📚 Categorized research papers with bib keys, tags, and abstracts  
- 🧭 Explore hashing methods across supervised, unsupervised, deep, and multimodal setups  
- 🧱 Quantization, indexing, and retrieval models clearly separated  
- 📌 Curated conference list, datasets, tools, and survey papers  
- 🔄 Updated regularly with community feedback and recent literature
