	<td><p>There is a large volume of late antique and medieval Hebrew texts. They represent a crucial linguistic and cultural bridge between Biblical and modern Hebrew. Poetry is prominent in these texts and one of its main haracteristics is the frequent use of metaphor. Distinguishing figurative and literal language use is a major task for scholars of the Humanities especially in the fields of literature linguistics and hermeneutics. This paper presents a new challenging dataset of late antique and medieval Hebrew poetry with expert annotations of metaphor as well as some baseline results which we hope will facilitate further research in this area.</p>

	<td><p>In approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods based on approximate proximity graphs DiskANN achieves good recall-speed balance for large-scale datasets using both of RAM and storage. Despite it claims to save memory usage by loading compressed vectors by product quantization (PQ) its memory usage increases in proportion to the scale of datasets. In this paper we propose All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization (AiSAQ) which offloads the compressed vectors to storage. Our method achieves sim10 MB memory usage in query search even with billion-scale datasets with minor performance degradation. AiSAQ also reduces the index load time before query search which enables the index switch between muitiple billion-scale datasets and significantly enhances the flexibility of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This method is applicable to all graph-based ANNS algorithms and can be combined with higher-spec ANNS methods in the future.</p>

SOAR extends upon previous approaches to ANN search such as spill trees that utilize multiple redundant representations while partitioning the data to reduce the probability of missing a nearest neighbor during search. Rather than training and computing these redundant representations independently however SOAR uses an orthogonality-amplified residual loss which optimizes each representation to compensate for cases where other representations perform poorly. This drastically improves the overall index quality resulting in state-of-the-art ANN benchmark performance while maintaining fast indexing times and low memory consumption.</p>

Departing from the prevalent focus on performance enhancements this work prioritizes the crucial trade-off between performance and memory requirements. The proposed model uses a transformer-based architecture designed to estimate image-to-image similarity by capturing interactions within and across images based on their local descriptors. A distinctive property of the model is the capability for asymmetric similarity estimation. Database images are represented with a smaller number of descriptors compared to query images enabling performance improvements without increasing memory consumption. To ensure adaptability across different applications a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase. Results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both hand-crafted and learned models. In particular compared with current state-of-the-art methods that overlook their memory footprint our approach not only attains superior performance but does so with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

	<td><p>Cayley hash functions are based on a simple idea of using a pair of semigroup elements A and B to hash the 0 and 1 bit respectively and then to hash an arbitrary bit string in the natural way by using multiplication of elements in the semigroup. The main advantage of Cayley hash functions compared to say hash functions in the SHA family is that when an already hashed document is amended one does not have to hash the whole amended document all over again but rather hash just the amended part and then multiply the result by the hash of the original document. Some authors argued that this may be a security hazard specifically that this property may facilitate finding a second preimage by splitting a long bit string into shorter pieces. In this paper we offer a way to get rid of this alleged disadvantage and keep the advantages at the same time. We call this method ``Cayley hashing with cookies using terminology borrowed from the theory of random walks in a random environment. For the platform semigroup we use 2x2 matrices over F_p.</p>

Moreover the process of image search is improved through a learning-based approach where the images of the database are classified using an adapted similarity metric to the statistical modeling of the RCT-Plus transform. A query is then first classified to select the best texture class after which the retained class images are ranked to select top ones. By this we have achieved significant improvements in the retrieval rates compared to previous CBIR schemes.</p>

	<td><p>As datasets grow larger, matching and merging entries from different databases has become a costly task in modern data pipelines. To avoid expensive comparisons between entries, blocking similar items is a popular preprocessing step. In this paper, we introduce BlockBoost, a novel boosting-based method that generates compact binary hash codes for database entries, through which blocking can be performed efficiently. The algorithm is fast and scalable, resulting in computational costs that are orders of magnitude lower than current benchmarks. Unlike existing alternatives, BlockBoost comes with associated feature importance measures for interpretability, and possesses strong theoretical guarantees, including lower bounds on critical performance metrics like recall and reduction ratio. Finally, we show that BlockBoost delivers great empirical results, outperforming state-of-the-art blocking benchmarks in terms of both performance metrics and computational cost.</p>

	<td><p>Graph is a ubiquitous representation of data in various research fields and graph embedding is a prevalent machine learning technique for capturing key features and generating fixed-sized attributes. However most state-of-the-art graph embedding methods are computationally and spatially expensive. Recently the Graph Encoder Embedding (GEE) has been shown as the fastest graph embedding technique and is suitable for a variety of network data applications. As real-world data often involves large and sparse graphs the huge sparsity usually results in redundant computations and storage. To address this issue we propose an improved version of GEE sparse GEE which optimizes the calculation and storage of zero entries in sparse matrices to enhance the running time further. Our experiments demonstrate that the sparse version achieves significant speedup compared to the original GEE with Python implementation for large sparse graphs and sparse GEE is capable of processing millions of edges within minutes on a standard laptop.</p>

	<td><p>Existing unsupervised deep product quantization methods primarily aim for the increased similarity between different views of the identical image whereas the delicate multi-level semantic similarities preserved between images are overlooked. Moreover these methods predominantly focus on the Euclidean space for computational convenience compromising their ability to map the multi-level semantic relationships between images effectively. To mitigate these shortcomings we propose a novel unsupervised product quantization method dubbed erarchical yperbolic roduct uantization (HiHPQ) which learns quantized representations by incorporating hierarchical semantic similarity within hyperbolic geometry. Specifically we propose a hyperbolic product quantizer where the hyperbolic codebook attention mechanism and the quantized contrastive learning on the hyperbolic product manifold are introduced to expedite quantization. Furthermore we propose a hierarchical semantics learning module designed to enhance the distinction between similar and non-matching images for a query by utilizing the extracted hierarchical semantics as an additional training supervision. Experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Existing fine-grained hashing methods typically lack code interpretability as they compute hash code bits holistically using both global and local features. To address this limitation we propose ConceptHash a novel method that achieves sub-code level interpretability. In ConceptHash each sub-code corresponds to a human-understandable concept such as an object part and these concepts are automatically discovered without human annotations. Specifically we leverage a Vision Transformer architecture and introduce concept tokens as visual prompts along with image patch tokens as model inputs. Each concept is then mapped to a specific sub-code at the model output providing natural sub-code interpretability. To capture subtle visual differences among highly similar sub-categories (e.g. bird species) we incorporate language guidance to ensure that the learned hash codes are distinguishable within fine-grained object classes while maintaining semantic alignment. This approach allows us to develop hash codes that exhibit similarity within families of species while remaining distinct from species in other families. Extensive experiments on four fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that ConceptHash outperforms previous methods by a significant margin offering unique sub-code interpretability as an additional benefit.

	<td><p>Many image retrieval studies use metric learning to train an image encoder. However metric learning cannot handle differences in users preferences and requires data to train an image encoder. To overcome these limitations we revisit relevance feedback a classic technique for interactive retrieval systems and propose an interactive CLIP-based image retrieval system with relevance feedback. Our retrieval system first executes the retrieval collects each users unique preferences through binary feedback and returns images the user prefers. Even when users have various preferences our retrieval system learns each users preference through the feedback and adapts to the preference. Moreover our retrieval system leverages CLIPs zero-shot transferability and achieves high accuracy without training. We empirically show that our retrieval system competes well with state-of-the-art metric learning in category-based image retrieval despite not training image encoders specifically for each dataset. Furthermore we set up two additional experimental settings where users have various preferences one-label-based image retrieval and conditioned image retrieval. In both cases our retrieval system effectively adapts to each users preferences resulting in improved accuracy compared to image retrieval without feedback. Overall our work highlights the potential benefits of integrating CLIP with classic relevance feedback techniques to enhance image retrieval.</p>

These graphs comprise multiple modalities including object-level point clouds images attributes and relationships between objects offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional methods that rely on extensive image databases. Given the available modalities the proposed method SceneGraphLoc learns a fixed-sized embedding for each node (i.e. representing an object instance) in the scene graph enabling effective matching with the objects visible in the input query image. This strategy significantly outperforms other cross-modal methods even without incorporating images into the map embeddings. When images are leveraged SceneGraphLoc achieves performance close to that of state-of-the-art techniques depending on large image databases while requiring three orders-of-magnitude less storage and operating orders-of-magnitude faster.

We introduce FlipHash a consistent range-hashing algorithm with constant time complexity and low memory requirements. Like Jump Consistent Hash FlipHash is intended for applications where resources can be indexed sequentially. Under this condition it ensures that keys are hashed evenly across resources and that changing the number of resources only causes keys to be remapped from a removed resource or to an added one but never shuffled across persisted ones. FlipHash differentiates itself with its low computational cost achieving constant-time complexity. We show that FlipHash beats Jump Consistent Hashs cost which is logarithmic in the number of resources both theoretically and in experiments over practical settings.</p>

	<td><p>This article studies deep unsupervised hashing, which has attracted increasing attention in large-scale image retrieval. The majority of recent approaches usually reconstruct semantic similarity information, which then guides the hash code learning. However, they still fail to achieve satisfactory performance in reality for two reasons. On the one hand, without accurate supervised information, these methods usually fail to produce independent and robust hash codes with semantics information well preserved, which may hinder effective image retrieval. On the other hand, due to discrete constraints, how to effectively optimize the hashing network in an end-to-end manner with small quantization errors remains a problem. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method called HARR to learn discriminative and high-quality hash codes. To comprehensively explore semantic similarity structure, HARR adopts the Winner-Take-All hash to model the similarity structure. Then similarity-preserving hash codes are learned under the reliable guidance of the reconstructed similarity structure. Additionally, we improve the quality of hash codes by a bit correlation reduction module, which forces the cross-correlation matrix between a batch of hash codes under different augmentations to approach the identity matrix. In this way, the generated hash bits are expected to be invariant to disturbances with minimal redundancy, which can be further interpreted as an instantiation of the information bottleneck principle. Finally, for effective hashing network training, we minimize the cosine distances between real-value network outputs and their binary codes for small quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HARR.</p>

Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance they exhibit limitations in handling large-scale diverse and ambiguous real-world needs of retrieval due to the computation cost and the injective embeddings they produce. This paper presents a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (CFIR) framework designed for fast and effective large-scale long-text to image retrieval. The first stage Entity-based Ranking (ER) adapts to long-text query ambiguity by employing a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets paradigm facilitating candidate filtering for the next stage. The second stage Summary-based Re-ranking (SR) refines these rankings using summarized queries. We also propose a specialized Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder optimized for handling ambiguous user needs and both stages which also enhances computational efficiency through vector-based similarity inference. Evaluation on the AToMiC dataset reveals that CFIR surpasses existing MLLMs by up to 11.06 in Recall@1000 while reducing training and retrieval times by 68.75 and 99.79 respectively.

While considerable success has been achieved there still exist urgent limitations. Existing works ignore the locality relationships of representations and attributes which have effective transferability between seeable classes and unseeable classes. Also the continuous-value attributes are not fully harnessed. In response we conduct a COMprehensive Attribute Exploration for ZSH named COMAE which depicts the relationships from seen classes to unseen ones through three meticulously designed explorations i.e. point-wise pair-wise and class-wise consistency constraints. By regressing attributes from the proposed attribute prototype network COMAE learns the local features that are relevant to the visual attributes. Then COMAE utilizes contrastive learning to comprehensively depict the context of attributes rather than instance-independent optimization. Finally the class-wise constraint is designed to cohesively learn the hash code image representation and visual attributes more effectively. Experimental results on the popular ZSH datasets demonstrate that COMAE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing techniques especially in scenarios with a larger number of unseen label classes.</p>

	<td><p>Redescription mining is a data analysis technique that has found applications in diverse fields. The most used redescription mining approaches involve two phases finding matching pairs among data attributes and extending the pairs. This process is relatively efficient when the number of attributes remains limited and when the attributes are Boolean but becomes almost intractable when the data consist of many numerical attributes. In this paper we present new algorithms that perform the matching and extension orders of magnitude faster than the existing approaches. Our algorithms are based on locality-sensitive hashing with a tailored approach to handle the discretisation of numerical attributes as used in redescription mining.</p>

	<td><p>This study proposes a novel hybrid retrieval strategy for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures to improve retrieval performance particularly for sparse data. The traditional cosine similarity measure is widely used to capture the similarity between vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However it has been shown that this measure can yield arbitrary results in certain scenarios. To address this limitation we incorporate cosine distance measures to provide a complementary perspective by quantifying the dissimilarity between vectors. Our approach is experimented on proprietary data unlike recent publications that have used open-source datasets. The proposed method demonstrates enhanced retrieval performance and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic relationships between documents or items. This hybrid strategy offers a promising solution for efficiently and accurately retrieving relevant information in knowledge-intensive applications leveraging techniques such as BM25 (sparse) retrieval vector (Dense) retrieval and cosine distance based retrieval to facilitate efficient information retrieval.</p>

It is widely applied in various applications such as image-text cross-modal search. In this paper we explore the potential of enhancing the performance of learning to hash with the proliferation of powerful large pre-trained models such as Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models. We introduce a novel method named Distillation for Cross-Modal Quantization (DCMQ) which leverages the rich semantic knowledge of VLP models to improve hash representation learning. Specifically we use the VLP as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teacher to distill knowledge into a </code>student hashing model equipped with codebooks. This process involves the replacement of supervised labels which are composed of multi-hot vectors and lack semantics with the rich semantics of VLP. In the end we apply a transformation termed Normalization with Paired Consistency (NPC) to achieve a discriminative target for distillation. Further we introduce a new quantization method Product Quantization with Gumbel (PQG) that promotes balanced codebook learning thereby improving the retrieval performance. Extensive benchmark testing demonstrates that DCMQ consistently outperforms existing supervised cross-modal hashing approaches showcasing its significant potential.</p>

Here the metric _s(^dell_p) consists of sets of s vectors in ^d and for any two sets xy of s vectors the distance (xy) is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between xy where the cost of matching two vectors is their ell_p distance. Previously Andoni Indyk and Krauthgamer gave a (data-independent) locality-sensitive hashing scheme for _s(^dell_p) when p in 12 with approximation O(log^2 s). By being data-dependent we improve the approximation to (log s). Our main technical contribution is to show that for any distribution mu supported on the metric _s(^d ell_p) there exists a data-dependent LSH for dense regions of mu which achieves approximation (log s) and that the data-independent LSH actually achieves a (log s)-approximation outside of those dense regions. Finally we show how to glue together these two hashing schemes without any additional loss in the approximation. Beyond nearest neighbor search our data-dependent LSH also gives optimal (distributional) sketches for the Earth Movers Distance. By known sketching lower bounds this implies that our LSH is optimal (up to (log log s) factors) among those that collide close points with constant probability.</p>

Recently hybrid networks that combine convolution and Transformer have achieved superior performance on various computer tasks and have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless the potential benefits of such hybrid networks in image retrieval still need to be verified. To this end we propose a hybrid convolutional and self-attention deep hashing method known as HybridHash. Specifically we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture in which the block aggregation function is introduced to achieve the effect of local self-attention and reduce the computational complexity. The interaction module has been elaborately designed to promote the communication of information between image blocks and to enhance the visual representations. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET.

	<td><p>Unsupervised semantic hashing has emerged as an indispensable technique for fast image search which aims to convert images into binary hash codes without relying on labels. Recent advancements in the field demonstrate that employing large-scale backbones (e.g. ViT) in unsupervised semantic hashing models can yield substantial improvements. However the inference delay has become increasingly difficult to overlook. Knowledge distillation provides a means for practical model compression to alleviate this delay. Nevertheless the prevailing knowledge distillation approaches are not explicitly designed for semantic hashing. They ignore the unique search paradigm of semantic hashing the inherent necessities of the distillation process and the property of hash codes. In this paper we propose an innovative Bit-mask Robust Contrastive knowledge Distillation (BRCD) method specifically devised for the distillation of semantic hashing models. To ensure the effectiveness of two kinds of search paradigms in the context of semantic hashing BRCD first aligns the semantic spaces between the teacher and student models through a contrastive knowledge distillation objective. Additionally to eliminate noisy augmentations and ensure robust optimization a cluster-based method within the knowledge distillation process is introduced. Furthermore through a bit-level analysis we uncover the presence of redundancy bits resulting from the bit independence property. To mitigate these effects we introduce a bit mask mechanism in our knowledge distillation objective. Finally extensive experiments not only showcase the noteworthy performance of our BRCD method in comparison to other knowledge distillation methods but also substantiate the generality of our methods across diverse semantic hashing models and backbones. The code for BRCD is available at httpsgithub.com/hly1998/BRCD.</p>

In 1947 Rao proved a lower bound on the size of any orthogonal array and raised the problem of constructing arrays of minimum size. Kuperberg Lovett and Peled (2017) gave a non-constructive existence proof of orthogonal arrays whose size is near-optimal (i.e. within a polynomial of Raos lower bound) leaving open the question of an algorithmic construction. We give the first explicit deterministic algorithmic construction of orthogonal arrays achieving near-optimal size for all parameters. Our construction uses algebraic geometry codes. In pseudorandomness the notions of t-independent generators or t-independent hash functions are equivalent to orthogonal arrays. Classical constructions of t-independent hash functions are known when the size of the codomain is a prime power but very few constructions are known for an arbitrary codomain. Our construction yields algorithmically efficient t-independent hash functions for arbitrary domain and codomain.</p>

	<td><p>Virtual screening (VS) is a critical step in computer-aided drug discovery aiming to identify molecules that bind to a specific target receptor like protein. Traditional VS methods such as docking are often too time-consuming for screening large-scale molecular databases. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated that learning vector representations for both proteins and molecules using contrastive learning can outperform traditional docking methods. However given that target databases often contain billions of molecules real-valued vector representations adopted by existing methods can still incur significant memory and time costs in VS. To address this problem in this paper we propose a hashing-based contrastive learning method called DrugHash for VS. DrugHash treats VS as a retrieval task that uses efficient binary hash codes for retrieval. In particular DrugHash designs a simple yet effective hashing strategy to enable end-to-end learning of binary hash codes for both protein and molecule modalities which can dramatically reduce the memory and time costs with higher accuracy compared with existing methods. Experimental results show that DrugHash can outperform existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with a memory saving of 32times and a speed improvement of 3.5times.</p>

	<td><p>The distribution of keys to a given number of buckets is a fundamental task in distributed data processing and storage. A simple fast and therefore popular approach is to map the hash values of keys to buckets based on the remainder after dividing by the number of buckets. Unfortunately these mappings are not stable when the number of buckets changes which can lead to severe spikes in system resource utilization such as network or database requests. Consistent hash algorithms can minimize remappings but are either significantly slower than the modulo-based approach require floating-point arithmetic or are based on a family of hash functions rarely available in standard libraries. This paper introduces JumpBackHash which uses only integer arithmetic and a standard pseudorandom generator. Due to its speed and simple implementation it can safely replace the modulo-based approach to improve assignment and system stability. A production-ready Java implementation of JumpBackHash has been released as part of the Hash4j open source library.</p>

In this paper we propose a TransClippedCLR model by encoding the global context of an image using Transformer having local context through patch based processing by generating the hash codes through product quantization and by avoiding the potential false negative pairs through clipped contrastive learning. The proposed model is tested with superior performance for unsupervised image retrieval on benchmark datasets including CIFAR10 NUS-Wide and Flickr25K as compared to the recent state-of-the-art deep models.

Conventional approaches rely on similarity matching in continuous Euclidean space of vectorized node embeddings. To handle intensive similarity computation efficiently hashing techniques for graph-structured data have emerged as a prominent research direction. However despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space previous studies have encountered catastrophic performance decay. To address this challenge we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network for effective Top-N search. Our findings indicate the learning effectiveness of incorporating hashing techniques within the exploration of bipartite graph reception fields as opposed to simply treating hashing as post-processing to output embeddings. To further enhance the model performance we advance upon these findings and propose Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing (BGCH+). BGCH+ introduces a novel dual augmentation approach to both intermediate information and hash code outputs in the latent feature spaces thereby producing more expressive and robust hash codes within a dual self-supervised learning paradigm. Comprehensive empirical analyses on six real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our dual feature contrastive learning in boosting the performance of BGCH+ compared to existing approaches.</p>

	<td><p>The target of cross-modal hashing is to embed heterogeneous multimedia data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, which plays a pivotal part in multimedia retrieval due to the emergence of big multimodal data. Recently, matrix factorization has achieved great success in cross-modal hashing. However, how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization, which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function, leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover, the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search, and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy. The experimental results on two benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Gene sequence search is a fundamental operation in computational genomics. Due to the petabyte scale of genome archives most gene search systems now use hashing-based data structures such as Bloom Filters (BF). The state-of-the-art systems such as Compact bit-slicing signature index (COBS) and Repeated And Merged Bloom filters (RAMBO) use BF with Random Hash (RH) functions for gene representation and identification. The standard recipe is to cast the gene search problem as a sequence of membership problems testing if each subsequent gene substring (called kmer) of Q is present in the set of kmers of the entire gene database D. We observe that RH functions which are crucial to the memory and the computational advantage of BF are also detrimental to the system performance of gene-search systems. While subsequent kmers being queried are likely very similar RH oblivious to any similarity uniformly distributes the kmers to different parts of potentially large BF thus triggering excessive cache misses and causing system slowdown. We propose a novel hash function called the Identity with Locality (IDL) hash family which co-locates the keys close in input space without causing collisions. This approach ensures both cache locality and key preservation. IDL functions can be a drop-in replacement for RH functions and help improve the performance of information retrieval systems. We give a simple but practical construction of IDL function families and show that replacing the RH with IDL functions reduces cache misses by a factor of 5x thus improving query and indexing times of SOTA methods such as COBS and RAMBO by factors up to 2x without compromising their quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the false positive rate of BF with IDL functions. Our hash function is the first study that bridges Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) and RH to obtain cache efficiency.</p>

Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models like Prithvi for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62 on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51 on ForestNet-12 outperforming other RGB-based models. Further we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression.

This performance improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets which highlights the need to learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks.

This exploration culminates in the unveiling of the quasi-triangular principle a novel framework that elucidates the triangular-like interplay between query positive document and negative document. Fueled by this guiding principle we introduce TriSampler a straightforward yet highly effective negative sampling method.

	<td><p>Cross-encoder (CE) models which compute similarity by jointly encoding a query-item pair perform better than embedding-based models (dual-encoders) at estimating query-item relevance. Existing approaches perform k-NN search with CE by approximating the CE similarity with a vector embedding space fit either with dual-encoders (DE) or CUR matrix factorization. DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approaches suffer from poor recall on new domains and the retrieval with DE is decoupled from the CE. While CUR-based approaches can be more accurate than the DE-based approach they require a prohibitively large number of CE calls to compute item embeddings thus making it impractical for deployment at scale. In this paper we address these shortcomings with our proposed sparse-matrix factorization based method that efficiently computes latent query and item embeddings to approximate CE scores and performs k-NN search with the approximate CE similarity. We compute item embeddings offline by factorizing a sparse matrix containing query-item CE scores for a set of train queries. Our method produces a high-quality approximation while requiring only a fraction of CE calls as compared to CUR-based methods and allows for leveraging DE to initialize the embedding space while avoiding compute- and resource-intensive finetuning of DE via distillation. At test time the item embeddings remain fixed and retrieval occurs over rounds alternating between a) estimating the test query embedding by minimizing error in approximating CE scores of items retrieved thus far and b) using the updated test query embedding for retrieving more items. Our k-NN search method improves recall by up to 5 (k=1) and 54 (k=100) over DE-based approaches. Additionally our indexing approach achieves a speedup of up to 100x over CUR-based and 5x over DE distillation methods while matching or improving k-NN search recall over baselines.</p>

Recent research adopts graph convolutional hashing for BGH and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However the contributions of its various influencing factors to hashing performance have not been explored in-depth including the same/different sign count between two binary embeddings during Hamming space search (sign property) the contribution of sub-embeddings at each layer (model property) the contribution of different node types in the bipartite graph (node property) and the combination of augmentation methods. In this work we build a lightweight graph convolutional hashing model named LightGCH by mainly removing the augmentation methods of the state-of-the-art model BGCH. By analyzing the contributions of each layer and node type to performance as well as analyzing the Hamming similarity statistics at each layer we find that the actual neighbors in the bipartite graph tend to have low Hamming similarity at the shallow layer and all nodes tend to have high Hamming similarity at the deep layers in LightGCH. To tackle these problems we propose a novel sign-guided framework SGBGH to make improvement which uses sign-guided negative sampling to improve the Hamming similarity of neighbors and uses sign-aware contrastive learning to help nodes learn more uniform representations.

	<td><p>Implementing cross-modal hashing between 2D images and 3D point-cloud data is a growing concern in real-world retrieval systems. Simply applying existing cross-modal approaches to this new task fails to adequately capture latent multi-modal semantics and effectively bridge the modality gap between 2D and 3D. To address these issues without relying on hand-crafted labels we propose contrastive masked autoencoders based self-supervised hashing (CMAH) for retrieval between images and point-cloud data. We start by contrasting 2D-3D pairs and explicitly constraining them into a joint Hamming space. This contrastive learning process ensures robust discriminability for the generated hash codes and effectively reduces the modality gap. Moreover we utilize multi-modal auto-encoders to enhance the models understanding of multi-modal semantics. By completing the masked image/point-cloud data modeling task the model is encouraged to capture more localized clues. In addition the proposed multi-modal fusion block facilitates fine-grained interactions among different modalities. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed CMAH significantly outperforms all baseline methods.</p>

Though such sketchy tags do not obviously reveal the labels they actually contain useful semantic information for supervising deep quantization. To this end we propose Weakly-Supervised Deep Hyperspherical Quantization (WSDHQ) which is the first work to learn deep quantization from weakly tagged images. Specifically 1) we use word embeddings to represent the tags and enhance their semantic information based on a tag correlation graph. 2) To better preserve semantic information in quantization codes and reduce quantization error we jointly learn semantics-preserving embeddings and supervised quantizer on hypersphere by employing a well-designed fusion layer and tailor-made loss functions. Extensive experiments show that WSDHQ can achieve state-of-art performance on weakly-supervised compact coding. Code is available at httpsgithub.com/gimpong/AAAI21-WSDHQ.</p>

However in real practice data correspondence across modalities may be partially provided. In this research we introduce an innovative unsupervised hashing technique designed for semi-paired cross-modal retrieval tasks named Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing (RREH). RREH assumes that multi-modal data share a common subspace. For paired data RREH explores the latent consistent information of heterogeneous modalities by seeking a shared representation. For unpaired data to effectively capture the latent discriminative features the high-order relationships between unpaired data and anchors are embedded into the latent subspace which are computed by efficient linear reconstruction. The anchors are sampled from paired data which improves the efficiency of hash learning. The RREH trains the underlying features and the binary encodings in a unified framework with high-order reconstruction relations preserved. With the well devised objective function and discrete optimization algorithm RREH is designed to be scalable making it suitable for large-scale datasets and facilitating efficient cross-modal retrieval. In the evaluation process the proposed is tested with partially paired data to establish its superiority over several existing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Image-text matching has been a long-standing problem which seeks to connect vision and language through semantic understanding. Due to the capability to manage large-scale raw data unsupervised hashing-based approaches have gained prominence recently. They typically construct a semantic similarity structure using the natural distance which subsequently provides guidance to the model optimization process. However the similarity structure could be biased at the boundaries of semantic distributions causing error accumulation during sequential optimization. To tackle this we introduce a novel hashing approach termed Distribution-based Structure Mining with Consistency Learning (DEMO) for efficient image-text matching. From a statistical view DEMO characterizes each image using multiple augmented views which are considered as samples drawn from its intrinsic semantic distribution. Then we employ a non-parametric distribution divergence to ensure a robust and precise similarity structure. In addition we introduce collaborative consistency learning which not only preserves the similarity structure in the Hamming space but also encourages consistency between retrieval distribution from different directions in a self-supervised manner. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark image-text matching datasets we demonstrate that DEMO achieves superior performance compared with many state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Image retrieval i.e. finding desired images given a reference image inherently encompasses rich multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures. Recent works leverage text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However they primarily focus on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To show this we introduce MagicLens a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g. inside view of) and we can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via foundation models. Trained on 36.7M (query image instruction target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web MagicLens achieves results comparable with or better than prior best on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks while maintaining high parameter efficiency with a significantly smaller model size. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.

	<td><p>Exact nearest neighbor search is a computationally intensive process and even its simpler sibling â vector retrieval â can be computationally complex. This is exacerbated when retrieving vectors which have high-dimension d relative to the number of vectors N in the database. Exact nearest neighbor retrieval has been generally acknowledged to be a O(Nd) problem with no sub-linear solutions. Attention has instead shifted towards Approximate Nearest-Neighbor (ANN) retrieval techniques many of which have sub-linear or even logarithmic time complexities. However if our intuition from binary search problems (e.g. d=1 vector retrieval) carries there ought to be a way to retrieve an organized representation of vectors without brute-forcing our way to a solution. For low dimension (e.g. d=2 or d=3 cases) provide a O(dlog N) algorithm for retrieval. Unfortunately the algorithm deteriorates rapidly to a O(dN) solution at high dimensions (e.g. k=128) in practice. We propose a novel algorithm for logarithmic Fast Exact Retrieval for Nearest-neighbor lookup (FERN) inspired by . The algorithm achieves O(dlog N) look-up with 100 recall on 10 million d=128 uniformly randomly generated vectors.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing methods have attracted widespread attention with the explosive growth of large-scale data which can greatly reduce storage and computation by learning compact binary codes. Existing unsupervised hashing methods attempt to exploit the valuable information from samples which fails to take the local geometric structure of unlabeled samples into consideration. Moreover hashing based on auto-encoders aims to minimize the reconstruction loss between the input data and binary codes which ignores the potential consistency and complementarity of multiple sources data. To address the above issues we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view binary clustering which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank constraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and affinity graphs to learn a unified binary code called Graph-Collaborated Auto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE). Specifically we propose a multi-view affinity graphs learning model with low-rank constraint which can mine the underlying geometric information from multi-view data. Then we design an encoder-decoder paradigm to collaborate the multiple affinity graphs which can learn a unified binary code effectively. Notably we impose the decorrelation and code balance constraints on binary codes to reduce the quantization errors. Finally we utilize an alternating iterative optimization scheme to obtain the multi-view clustering results. Extensive experimental results on 5 public datasets are provided to reveal the effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance over other state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

However the retrieved images sometimes contain results that are not semantically related to the query. To address this we propose a method for CBIR that captures both visual and semantic similarity using a visual hierarchy. The hierarchy is constructed by merging classes with overlapping features in the latent space of a deep neural network trained for classification assuming that overlapping classes share high visual and semantic similarities. Finally the constructed hierarchy is integrated into the distance calculation metric for similarity search. Experiments on standard datasets CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100 and a real-life use case using diatom microscopy images show that our method achieves superior performance compared to the existing methods on image retrieval.</p>

Although numerous existing approaches attempt to incorporate transfer learning techniques into deep hashing frameworks, they often neglect the essential invariance for adequate alignment between these two domains. Worse yet, these methods fail to distinguish between causal and non-causal effects embedded in images, rendering cross-domain retrieval ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose an Invariance-acquired Domain AdaptivE HAshing (IDEA) model. Our IDEA first decomposes each image into a causal feature representing label information, and a non-causal feature indicating domain information. Subsequently, we generate discriminative hash codes using causal features with consistency learning on both source and target domains. More importantly, we employ a generative model for synthetic samples to simulate the intervention of various non-causal effects, ultimately minimizing their impact on hash codes for domain invariance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our IDEA compared to a variety of competitive baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search is an essential component of search engines recommendation systems etc. Many recent works focus on learning-based data-distribution-dependent hashing and achieve good retrieval performance. However due to increasing demand for users privacy and security we often need to remove users data information from Machine Learning (ML) models to satisfy specific privacy and security requirements. This need requires the ANN search algorithm to support fast online data deletion and insertion. Current learning-based hashing methods need retraining the hash function which is prohibitable due to the vast time-cost of large-scale data. To address this problem we propose a novel data-dependent hashing method named unfolded self-reconstruction locality-sensitive hashing (USR-LSH). Our USR-LSH unfolded the optimization update for instance-wise data reconstruction which is better for preserving data information than data-independent LSH. Moreover our USR-LSH supports fast online data deletion and insertion without retraining. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to address the machine unlearning of retrieval problems. Empirically we demonstrate that USR-LSH outperforms the state-of-the-art data-distribution-independent LSH in ANN tasks in terms of precision and recall. We also show that USR-LSH has significantly faster data deletion and insertion time than learning-based data-dependent hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is an effective randomized technique widely used in many machine learning tasks. The cost of hashing is proportional to data dimensions and thus often the performance bottleneck when dimensionality is high and the number of hash functions involved is large. Surprisingly however little work has been done to improve the efficiency of LSH computation. In this paper we design a simple yet efficient LSH scheme named FastLSH under l2 norm. By combining random sampling and random projection FastLSH reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(m) (m&lt;n) where n is the data dimensionality and m is the number of sampled dimensions. Moreover FastLSH has provable LSH property which distinguishes it from the non-LSH fast sketches. We conduct comprehensive experiments over a collection of real and synthetic datasets for the nearest neighbor search task. Experimental results demonstrate that FastLSH is on par with the state-of-the-arts in terms of answer quality space occupation and query efficiency while enjoying up to 80x speedup in hash function evaluation. We believe that FastLSH is a promising alternative to the classic LSH scheme.</p>

This article proposed a content-based jewellery item retrieval method using the local region-based histograms in HSV color space. Using five local regions our novel jewellery classification module extracts the specific feature vectors from the query image. The jewellery classification module is also applied to the jewellery database to extract feature vectors. Finally the similarity score is matched between the database and query features vectors to retrieve the jewellery items from the database. The proposed method performance is tested on publicly available jewellery item retrieval datasets i.e. ringFIR and Fashion Product Images dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the dominance of the proposed method over the baseline methods for retrieving desired jewellery products.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is at the heart of large-scale image similarity search and recent methods have been substantially improved through deep learning techniques. Such algorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a subsequent costly binarization step a common solution is to employ loss functions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are grouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that the embedding entries are close to binarized entries e.g. -1 or 1). Still the interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the embeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that decomposes the learning problem in two stages first perform similarity learning over the embedding space with no quantization; second find an optimal orthogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding is close to its sign and then quantize the transformed embedding through the sign function. In the second step we parametrize orthogonal transformations using Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent. Since similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal transformations this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of performance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised fast hyperparameter-free and can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning algorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets and unlike other quantization strategies brings consistent improvements in performance to existing deep hashing algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>In Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) a user combines a query image with text to describe their intended target. Existing methods rely on supervised learning of CIR models using labeled triplets consisting of the query image text specification and the target image. Labeling such triplets is expensive and hinders broad applicability of CIR. In this work we propose to study an important task Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) whose goal is to build a CIR model without requiring labeled triplets for training. To this end we propose a novel method called Pic2Word that requires only weakly labeled image-caption pairs and unlabeled image datasets to train. Unlike existing supervised CIR models our model trained on weakly labeled or unlabeled datasets shows strong generalization across diverse ZS-CIR tasks e.g. attribute editing object composition and domain conversion. Our approach outperforms several supervised CIR methods on the common CIR benchmark CIRR and Fashion-IQ.

	<td><p>Automatic crash bucketing is a crucial phase in the software development process for efficiently triaging bug reports. It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However with real-time streaming bug collection systems are needed to quickly answer the question What are the most similar bugs to a new one that is efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature we introduce DeepLSH a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist. We support this claim with a series of experiments on an original dataset which we make available.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based frameworks have been used efficiently to select weight vectors in a dense hidden layer with high cosine similarity to an input enabling dynamic pruning. While this type of scheme has been shown to improve computational training efficiency existing algorithms require repeated randomized projection of the full layer weight which is impractical for computational- and memory-constrained devices. In a distributed setting deferring LSH analysis to a centralized host is (i) slow if the device cluster is large and (ii) requires access to input data which is forbidden in a federated context. Using a new family of hash functions we develop one of the first private personalized and memory-efficient on-device LSH frameworks. Our framework enables privacy and personalization by allowing each device to generate hash tables without the help of a central host using device-specific hashing hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hash tables or hash length). Hash tables are generated with a compressed set of the full weights and can be serially generated and discarded if the process is memory-intensive. This allows devices to avoid maintaining (i) the fully-sized model and (ii) large amounts of hash tables in local memory for LSH analysis. We prove several statistical and sensitivity properties of our hash functions and experimentally demonstrate that our framework is competitive in training large-scale recommender networks compared to other LSH frameworks which assume unrestricted on-device capacity.</p>

Moreover these methods primarily emphasize the selection of query descriptors while overlooking support descriptors. In this paper we propose a novel Task-Aware Adaptive Local Descriptors Selection Network (TALDS-Net) which exhibits the capacity for adaptive selection of task-aware support descriptors and query descriptors. Specifically we compare the similarity of each local support descriptor with other local support descriptors to obtain the optimal support descriptor subset and then compare the query descriptors with the optimal support subset to obtain discriminative query descriptors.

While recent ReID methods prioritize high retrieval performance they often come with large computational costs and high search time rendering them less practical in real-world settings. In this work we propose an input-adaptive network with multiple exit blocks that can terminate computation early if the retrieval is straightforward or noisy saving a lot of computation. To assess the complexity of the input we introduce a temporal-based classifier driven by a new training strategy. Furthermore we adopt a binary hash code generation approach instead of relying on continuous-valued features which significantly improves the search process by a factor of 20. To ensure similarity preservation we utilize a new ranking regularizer that bridges the gap between continuous and binary features. Extensive analysis of our proposed method is conducted on three datasets Market1501 MSMT17 (Multi-Scene Multi-Time) and the BGC1 (BRIAR Government Collection). Using our approach more than 70 of the samples with compact hash codes exit early on the Market1501 dataset saving 80 of the networks computational cost and improving over other hash-based methods by 60. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over dynamic networks and showcase comparable accuracy performance to conventional ReID methods. Code will be made available.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing methods typically aim to preserve the similarity between data points in a feature space by mapping them to binary hash codes. However these methods often overlook the fact that the similarity between data points in the continuous feature space may not be preserved in the discrete hash code space due to the limited similarity range of hash codes. The similarity range is bounded by the code length and can lead to a problem known as similarity collapse. That is the positive and negative pairs of data points become less distinguishable from each other in the hash space. To alleviate this problem in this paper a novel Similarity Distribution Calibration (SDC) method is introduced. SDC aligns the hash code similarity distribution towards a calibration distribution (e.g. beta distribution) with sufficient spread across the entire similarity range thus alleviating the similarity collapse problem. Extensive experiments show that our SDC outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art alternatives on coarse category-level and instance-level image retrieval.

Existing hashing networks usually generate both local and global features through attention guidance on the same deep activation tensor which limits the diversity of feature representations. To handle this limitation we substitute convolutional descriptors for attention-guided features and propose an Attributes Grouping and Mining Hashing (AGMH) which groups and embeds the category-specific visual attributes in multiple descriptors to generate a comprehensive feature representation for efficient fine-grained image retrieval. Specifically an Attention Dispersion Loss (ADL) is designed to force the descriptors to attend to various local regions and capture diverse subtle details. Moreover we propose a Stepwise Interactive External Attention (SIEA) to mine critical attributes in each descriptor and construct correlations between fine-grained attributes and objects. The attention mechanism is dedicated to learning discrete attributes which will not cost additional computations in hash codes generation. Finally the compact binary codes are learned by preserving pairwise similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that AGMH consistently yields the best performance against state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we propose the Masked Space-Time Hash encoding (MSTH) a novel method for efficiently reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view or monocular videos. Based on the observation that dynamic scenes often contain substantial static areas that result in redundancy in storage and computations MSTH represents a dynamic scene as a weighted combination of a 3D hash encoding and a 4D hash encoding. The weights for the two components are represented by a learnable mask which is guided by an uncertainty-based objective to reflect the spatial and temporal importance of each 3D position. With this design our method can reduce the hash collision rate by avoiding redundant queries and modifications on static areas making it feasible to represent a large number of space-time voxels by hash tables with small size.Besides without the requirements to fit the large numbers of temporally redundant features independently our method is easier to optimize and converge rapidly with only twenty minutes of training for a 300-frame dynamic scene.As a result MSTH obtains consistently better results than previous methods with only 20 minutes of training time and 130 MB of memory storage.

	<td><p>Image-text retrieval is one of the major tasks of cross-modal retrieval. Several approaches for this task map images and texts into a common space to create correspondences between the two modalities. However due to the content (semantics) richness of an image redundant secondary information in an image may cause false matches. To address this issue this paper presents a semantic optimization approach implemented as a Visual Semantic Loss (VSL) to assist the model in focusing on an images main content. This approach is inspired by how people typically annotate the content of an image by describing its main content. Thus we leverage the annotated texts corresponding to an image to assist the model in capturing the main content of the image reducing the negative impact of secondary content. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (MSCOCO and Flickr30K) demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The code is available at httpsgithub.com/ZhangXu0963/VSL.</p>

Instead of learning a vector for each query and document our framework learns a multivariate distribution and uses negative multivariate KL divergence to compute the similarity between distributions. For simplicity and efficiency reasons we assume that the distributions are multivariate normals and then train large language models to produce mean and variance vectors for these distributions.

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing has received extensive research focus on the past decade which typically aims at preserving a predefined metric (i.e. Euclidean metric) in the Hamming space. To this end the encoding functions of the existing hashing are typically quasi-isometric which devote to reducing the quantization loss from the target metric space to the discrete Hamming space. However it is indeed problematic to directly minimize such error since such mentioned two metric spaces are heterogeneous and the quasi-isometric mapping is non-linear. The former leads to inconsistent feature distributions while the latter leads to problematic optimization issues. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method termed Sparsity-Induced Generative Adversarial Hashing (SiGAH) to encode large-scale high-dimensional features into binary codes which well solves the two problems through a generative adversarial training framework. Instead of minimizing the quantization loss our key innovation lies in enforcing the learned Hamming space to have similar data distribution to the target metric space via a generative model. In particular we formulate a ReLU-based neural network as a generator to output binary codes and an MSE-loss based auto-encoder network as a discriminator upon which a generative adversarial learning is carried out to train hash functions. Furthermore to generate the synthetic features from the hash codes a compressed sensing procedure is introduced into the generative model which enforces the reconstruction boundary of binary codes to be consistent with that of original features. Finally such generative adversarial framework can be trained via the Adam optimizer. Experimental results on four benchmarks i.e. Tiny100K GIST1M Deep1M and MNIST have shown that the proposed SiGAH has superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>An efficient solution to the large-scale recommender system is to represent users and items as binary hash codes in the Hamming space. Towards this end existing methods tend to code users by modeling their Hamming similarities with the items they historically interact with which are termed as the first-order similarities in this work. Despite their efficiency these methods suffer from the suboptimal representative capacity since they forgo the correlation established by connecting multiple first-order similarities i.e. the relation among the indirect instances which could be defined as the high-order similarity. To tackle this drawback we propose to model both the first- and the high-order similarities in the Hamming space through the user-item bipartite graph. Therefore we develop a novel learning to hash framework namely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN) which explicitly models the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing models and obtains performance comparable with the real-valued recommendation models.</p>

	<td><p>Latent factor models are the dominant backbones of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) given their performance advantages where a unique vector embedding with a fixed dimensionality (e.g. 128) is required to represent each entity (commonly a user/item). Due to the large number of users and items on e-commerce sites the embedding table is arguably the least memory-efficient component of RSs. For any lightweight recommender that aims to efficiently scale with the growing size of users/items or to remain applicable in resource-constrained settings existing solutions either reduce the number of embeddings needed via hashing or sparsify the full embedding table to switch off selected embedding dimensions. However as hash collision arises or embeddings become overly sparse especially when adapting to a tighter memory budget those lightweight recommenders inevitably have to compromise their accuracy. To this end we propose a novel compact embedding framework for RSs namely Compositional Embedding with Regularized Pruning (CERP). Specifically CERP represents each entity by combining a pair of embeddings from two independent substantially smaller meta-embedding tables which are then jointly pruned via a learnable element-wise threshold. In addition we innovatively design a regularized pruning mechanism in CERP such that the two sparsified meta-embedding tables are encouraged to encode information that is mutually complementary. Given the compatibility with agnostic latent factor models we pair CERP with two popular recommendation models for extensive experiments where results on two real-world datasets under different memory budgets demonstrate its superiority against state-of-the-art baselines. The codebase of CERP is available in httpsgithub.com/xurong-liang/CERP.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised video hashing usually optimizes binary codes by learning to reconstruct input videos. Such reconstruction constraint spends much effort on frame-level temporal context changes without focusing on video-level global semantics that are more useful for retrieval. Hence we address this problem by decomposing video information into reconstruction-dependent and semantic-dependent information which disentangles the semantic extraction from reconstruction constraint. Specifically we first design a simple dual-stream structure including a temporal layer and a hash layer. Then with the help of semantic similarity knowledge obtained from self-supervision the hash layer learns to capture information for semantic retrieval while the temporal layer learns to capture the information for reconstruction. In this way the model naturally preserves the disentangled semantics into binary codes. Validated by comprehensive experiments our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on three video benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Many hashing algorithms including minwise hashing (MinHash) one permutation hashing (OPH) and consistent weighted sampling (CWS) generate integers of B bits. With k hashes for each data vector the storage would be Btimes k bits; and when used for large-scale learning the model size would be 2^Btimes k which can be expensive. A standard strategy is to use only the lowest b bits out of the B bits and somewhat increase k the number of hashes. In this study we propose to re-use the hashes by partitioning the B bits into m chunks e.g. btimes m =B. Correspondingly the model size becomes mtimes 2^b times k which can be substantially smaller than the original 2^Btimes k. Our theoretical analysis reveals that by partitioning the hash values into m chunks the accuracy would drop. In other words using m chunks of B/m bits would not be as accurate as directly using B bits. This is due to the correlation from re-using the same hash. On the other hand our analysis also shows that the accuracy would not drop much for (e.g.) m=2sim 4. In some regions Pb-Hash still works well even for m much larger than 4. We expect Pb-Hash would be a good addition to the family of hashing methods/applications and benefit industrial practitioners. We verify the effectiveness of Pb-Hash in machine learning tasks for linear SVM models as well as deep learning models. Since the hashed data are essentially categorical (ID) features we follow the standard practice of using embedding tables for each hash. With Pb-Hash we need to design an effective strategy to combine m embeddings. Our study provides an empirical evaluation on four pooling schemes concatenation max pooling mean pooling and product pooling. There is no definite answer which pooling would be always better and we leave that for future study.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing (MinHash) is a standard algorithm widely used in the industry for large-scale search and learning applications with the binary (0/1) Jaccard similarity. One common use of MinHash is for processing massive n-gram text representations so that practitioners do not have to materialize the original data (which would be prohibitive). Another popular use of MinHash is for building hash tables to enable sub-linear time approximate near neighbor (ANN) search. MinHash has also been used as a tool for building large-scale machine learning systems. The standard implementation of MinHash requires applying K random permutations. In comparison the method of one permutation hashing (OPH) is an efficient alternative of MinHash which splits the data vectors into K bins and generates hash values within each bin. OPH is substantially more efficient and also more convenient to use. In this paper we combine the differential privacy (DP) with OPH (as well as MinHash) to propose the DP-OPH framework with three variants DP-OPH-fix DP-OPH-re and DP-OPH-rand depending on which densification strategy is adopted to deal with empty bins in OPH. A detailed roadmap to the algorithm design is presented along with the privacy analysis. An analytical comparison of our proposed DP-OPH methods with the DP minwise hashing (DP-MH) is provided to justify the advantage of DP-OPH. Experiments on similarity search confirm the merits of DP-OPH and guide the choice of the proper variant in different practical scenarios. Our technique is also extended to bin-wise consistent weighted sampling (BCWS) to develop a new DP algorithm called DP-BCWS for non-binary data. Experiments on classification tasks demonstrate that DP-BCWS is able to achieve excellent utility at around epsilon = 5sim 10 where epsilon is the standard parameter in the language of (epsilon delta)-DP.</p>

Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously meet three key design requirements memory efficiency low latency and adaptability to dynamic data distribution. This paper presents CAFE a Compact Adaptive and Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements. The design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources to important features (called hot features) and allocate less memory to unimportant ones. In CAFE we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data structure named HotSketch to capture feature importance and report hot features in real time. For each reported hot feature we assign it a unique embedding. For the non-hot features we allow multiple features to share one embedding by using hash embedding technique. Guided by our design philosophy we further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the embedding tables of non-hot features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of HotSketch and analyze the model convergence against deviation. Extensive experiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding compression methods yielding 3.92 and 3.68 superior testing AUC on Criteo Kaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x.

	<td><p>Consistent hashing is a technique that can minimize key remapping when the number of hash buckets changes. The paper proposes a fast consistent hash algorithm (called power consistent hash) that has O(1) expected time for key lookup independent of the number of buckets. Hash values are computed in real time. No search data structure is constructed to store bucket ranges or key mappings. The algorithm has a lightweight design using O(1) space with superior scalability. In particular it uses two auxiliary hash functions to achieve distribution uniformity and O(1) expected time for key lookup. Furthermore it performs consistent hashing such that only a minimal number of keys are remapped when the number of buckets changes. Consistent hashing has a wide range of use cases including load balancing distributed caching and distributed key-value stores. The proposed algorithm is faster than well-known consistent hash algorithms with O(log n) lookup time.</p>

	<td><p>A minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) maps a set S of n keys to the first n integers without collisions. There is a lower bound of nlog(e)=1.44n bits needed to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm that tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed leading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for constructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building block. In this paper we introduce ShockHash - Small heavily overloaded cuckoo hash tables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and h_1 hoping for the existence of a function f S-0 1 such that x - h_f(x)(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to store f using n + o(n) bits. In graph terminology ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until stumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as nodes. Using cuckoo hashing ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the pseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about (e/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the seed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space consumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to brute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again to 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all possible pairs. ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be constructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches. It can build an MPHF for 10 million keys with 1.489 bits per key in about half an hour. When instead using ShockHash after an efficient k-perfect hash function it achieves space usage similar to the best competitors while being significantly faster to construct and query.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years, a number of online hashing methods have emerged, which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However, existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives, which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand, these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples, especially in the multi-label case. In this paper, we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific, we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives, only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition, we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

For the other data structure variants studied including DiskANN with fast preprocessing HNSW and NSG we present a family of instances on which the empirical query time required to achieve a reasonable accuracy is linear in instance size.

The second is the use of cross-attention at training time and knowledge distillation to encourage cross-attention-like features to be extracted at test time from a single image. When combined with the Vision Transformer architecture and zero-shot retrieval losses our approach yields state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy and TU-Berlin sketch-based image retrieval benchmarks. However unlike many previous methods none of the components in our approach are engineered specifically towards the sketch-based image retrieval task - it can be generally applied to any cross-domain zero-shot retrieval task. We therefore also show results on zero-shot cartoon-to-photo retrieval using the Office-Home dataset.</p>

This method requires accurate camera poses for the neural renderings of given scenes. However contrary to previous methods jointly optimizing camera poses and 3D scenes the naive gradient-based camera pose refinement method using multi-resolution hash encoding severely deteriorates performance. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to calibrate the camera pose and learn a geometric representation using efficient multi-resolution hash encoding. Showing that the oscillating gradient flows of hash encoding interfere with the registration of camera poses our method addresses the issue by utilizing smooth interpolation weighting to stabilize the gradient oscillation for the ray samplings across hash grids. Moreover the curriculum training procedure helps to learn the level-wise hash encoding further increasing the pose refinement. Experiments on the novel-view synthesis datasets validate that our learning frameworks achieve state-of-the-art performance and rapid convergence of neural rendering even when initial camera poses are unknown.</p>

	<td><p>The field of Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) has recently attained impressive results including the discovery of state-of-the-art machine learning solutions such as neural image classifiers. This is often done by applying an evolutionary search method which samples multiple candidate solutions from a large space and evaluates the quality of each candidate through a long training process. As a result the search tends to be slow. In this paper we show that large efficiency gains can be obtained by employing a fast unified functional hash especially through the functional equivalence caching technique which we also present. The central idea is to detect by hashing when the search method produces equivalent candidates which occurs very frequently and this way avoid their costly re-evaluation. Our hash is functional in that it identifies equivalent candidates even if they were represented or coded differently and it is unified in that the same algorithm can hash arbitrary representations; e.g. compute graphs imperative code or lambda functions. As evidence we show dramatic improvements on multiple AutoML domains including neural architecture search and algorithm discovery. Finally we consider the effect of hash collisions evaluation noise and search distribution through empirical analysis. Altogether we hope this paper may serve as a guide to hashing techniques in AutoML.</p>

A set of vectors S subseteq ^d is (k_2delta)-far from being clusterable if there are at least k_2 vectors in S with all pairwise distances at least delta. We propose a probabilistic algorithm to distinguish between these two cases. Our algorithm reaches a decision by only looking at the extreme values of a scalar valued hash function defined by a random field on S; hence it is especially suitable in distributed and online settings. An important feature of our method is that the algorithm is oblivious to the number of vectors in the online setting for example the algorithm stores only a constant number of scalars which is independent of the stream length. We introduce random field hash functions which are a key ingredient in our paradigm. Random field hash functions generalize locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). In addition to the LSH requirement that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nearby vectors are hashed to similar values our hash function also guarantees that the</code>hash values are (nearly) independent random variables for distant vectors. We formulate necessary conditions for the kernels which define the random fields applied to our problem as well as a measure of kernel optimality for which we provide a bound. Then we propose a method to construct kernels which approximate the optimal one.</p>

	<td><p>Large-scale embedding-based retrieval (EBR) is the cornerstone of search-related industrial applications. Given a user query the system of EBR aims to identify relevant information from a large corpus of documents that may be tens or hundreds of billions in size. The storage and computation turn out to be expensive and inefficient with massive documents and high concurrent queries making it difficult to further scale up. To tackle the challenge we propose a binary embedding-based retrieval (BEBR) engine equipped with a recurrent binarization algorithm that enables customized bits per dimension. Specifically we compress the full-precision query and document embeddings formulated as float vectors in general into a composition of multiple binary vectors using a lightweight transformation model with residual multilayer perception (MLP) blocks. We can therefore tailor the number of bits for different applications to trade off accuracy loss and cost savings. Importantly we enable task-agnostic efficient training of the binarization model using a new embedding-to-embedding strategy. We also exploit the compatible training of binary embeddings so that the BEBR engine can support indexing among multiple embedding versions within a unified system. To further realize efficient search we propose Symmetric Distance Calculation (SDC) to achieve lower response time than Hamming codes. We successfully employed the introduced BEBR to Tencent products including Sogou Tencent Video QQ World etc. The binarization algorithm can be seamlessly generalized to various tasks with multiple modalities. Extensive experiments on offline benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method significantly saving 30~50 index costs with almost no loss of accuracy at the system level.</p>

Numerous complementary embeddings can be derived from processing items originally represented in several modalities e.g. audio signals user interaction data or editorial data. However data of any given modality might not be available for all items in any music dataset. In this work we propose a method based on contrastive learning to combine embeddings from multiple modalities and explore the impact of the presence or absence of embeddings from diverse modalities in an artist similarity task. Experiments on two datasets suggest that our contrastive method outperforms single-modality embeddings and baseline algorithms for combining modalities both in terms of artist retrieval accuracy and coverage. Improvements with respect to other methods are particularly significant for less popular query artists. We demonstrate our method successfully combines complementary information from diverse modalities and is more robust to missing modality data (i.e. it better handles the retrieval of artists with different modality embeddings than the query artists).</p>

	<td><p>A Monotone Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MMPHF) constructed on a set S of keys is a function that maps each key in S to its rank. On keys not in S the function returns an arbitrary value. Applications range from databases search engines data encryption to pattern-matching algorithms. In this paper we describe LeMonHash a new technique for constructing MMPHFs for integers. The core idea of LeMonHash is surprisingly simple and effective we learn a monotone mapping from keys to their rank via an error-bounded piecewise linear model (the PGM-index) and then we solve the collisions that might arise among keys mapping to the same rank estimate by associating small integers with them in a retrieval data structure (BuRR). On synthetic random datasets LeMonHash needs 34 less space than the next larger competitor while achieving about 16 times faster queries. On real-world datasets the space usage is very close to or much better than the best competitors while achieving up to 19 times faster queries than the next larger competitor. As far as the construction of LeMonHash is concerned we get an improvement by a factor of up to 2 compared to the competitor with the next best space usage. We also investigate the case of keys being variable-length strings introducing the so-called LeMonHash-VL it needs space within 13 of the best competitors while achieving up to 3 times faster queries than the next larger competitor.</p>

	<td><p>The expenses involved in training state-of-the-art deep hashing retrieval models have witnessed an increase due to the adoption of more sophisticated models and large-scale datasets. Dataset Distillation (DD) or Dataset Condensation(DC) focuses on generating smaller synthetic dataset that retains the original information. Nevertheless existing DD methods face challenges in maintaining a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. And the state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods can not expand to all deep hashing retrieval methods. In this paper we propose an efficient condensation framework that addresses these limitations by matching the feature-embedding between synthetic set and real set. Furthermore we enhance the diversity of features by incorporating the strategies of early-stage augmented models and multi-formation. Extensive experiments provide compelling evidence of the remarkable superiority of our approach both in terms of performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p>

In this paper we present a novel concept that allows estimating the Levenshtein Distance the algorithm first compresses documents to signatures (similar to hash values) using a user-defined compression ratio. Signatures can then be compared against each other (some constrains apply) where the outcome is the estimated Levenshtein Distance. Our evaluation shows promising results in terms of runtime efficiency and accuracy. In addition we introduce a significance score allowing examiners to set a threshold and identify related documents.</p>

	<td><p>Searching on bipartite graphs is basal and versatile to many real-world Web applications e.g. online recommendation database retrieval and query-document searching. Given a query node the conventional approaches rely on the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the continuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity computation developing hashing techniques for graph structured data has recently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space prior work is however confronted with catastrophic performance decay. In this work we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We propose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach namely BGCH which consists of three novel and effective modules (1) adaptive graph convolutional hashing (2) latent feature dispersion and (3) Fourier serialized gradient estimation. Specifically the former two modules achieve the substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable information loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series decomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more accurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world datasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing hashing-based counterparts but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed model components contained therein.</p>

Many methods usually build the loss function from pairwise or triplet data points to capture the local similarity structure. Other existing methods construct the similarity graph and consider all points simultaneously. Auto-encoding Twin-bottleneck Hashing is one such method that dynamically builds the graph. Specifically each input data is encoded into a binary code and a continuous variable or the so-called twin bottlenecks. The similarity graph is then computed from these binary codes which get updated consistently during the training. In this work we generalize the original model into a supervised deep hashing network by incorporating the label information. In addition we examine the differences of codes structure between these two networks and consider the class imbalance problem especially in multi-labeled datasets. Experiments on three datasets yield statistically significant improvement against the original model. Results are also comparable and competitive to other supervised methods.</p>

Recently several adversarial attacks have been presented to reveal the vulnerability of deep hashing models against adversarial examples. However existing attack methods suffer from degraded performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations between original samples or spend a lot of time learning these relations with a deep neural network. In this paper we propose a novel Pharos-guided Attack dubbed PgA to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep hashing networks reliably and efficiently. Specifically we design pharos code to represent the semantics of the benign image which preserves the similarity to semantically relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly PgA can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in both attack strength and speed.</p>

Targeting at efficiency improvement this paper presents a simple and effective keyword-guided pre-screening framework for the image-text retrieval. Specifically we convert the image and text data into the keywords and perform the keyword matching across modalities to exclude a large number of irrelevant gallery samples prior to the retrieval network. For the keyword prediction we transfer it into a multi-label classification problem and propose a multi-task learning scheme by appending the multi-label classifiers to the image-text retrieval network to achieve a lightweight and high-performance keyword prediction. For the keyword matching we introduce the inverted index in the search engine and create a win-win situation on both time and space complexities for the pre-screening. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets i.e. Flickr30K and MS-COCO verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework equipped with only two embedding layers achieves O(1) querying time complexity while improving the retrieval efficiency and keeping its performance when applied prior to the common image-text retrieval methods.

Such vectors arise in many applications involving sparse data.

To this end we present tornado tabulation hashing which is simple fast and exhibits a certain full local randomness property that provably makes diverse algorithms perform almost as if (abstract) fully-random hashing was used. For example this includes classic linear probing the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet Fusy Gandouet Meunier AOFA 97 for counting distinct elements and the one-permutation hashing of Li Owen and Zhang NIPS 12 for large-scale machine learning. We also provide a very efficient solution for the classical problem of obtaining fully-random hashing on a fixed (but unknown to the hash function) set of n keys using O(n) space. As a consequence we get more efficient implementations of the splitting trick of Dietzfelbinger and Rink ICALP09 and the succinct space uniform hashing of Pagh and Pagh SICOMP08. Tornado tabulation hashing is based on a simple method to systematically break dependencies in tabulation-based hashing techniques.</p>

	<td><p>Visual Place Recognition is a task that aims to predict the coordinates of an image (called query) based solely on visual clues. Most commonly a retrieval approach is adopted where the query is matched to the most similar images from a large database of geotagged photos using learned global descriptors. Despite recent advances recognizing the same place when the query comes from a significantly different distribution is still a major hurdle for state of the art retrieval methods. Examples are heavy illumination changes (e.g. night-time images) or substantial occlusions (e.g. transient objects). In this work we explore whether re-ranking methods based on spatial verification can tackle these challenges following the intuition that local descriptors are inherently more robust than global features to domain shifts. To this end we provide a new comprehensive benchmark on current state of the art models. We also introduce two new demanding datasets with night and occluded queries to be matched against a city-wide database.

The degradation is especially severe since in general both the query and database distributions change. We introduce and analyze real-world image and video datasets for which temporal information is available over a long time period. Based on the learnings we devise DeDrift a method that updates embedding quantizers to continuously adapt large-scale indexing structures on-the-fly.

Like semantic segmentation extends classification to the pixel level pixel retrieval is an extension of image retrieval and offers information about which pixels are related to the query object. In addition to retrieving images for the given query it helps users quickly identify the query object in true positive images and exclude false positive images by denoting the correlated pixels. Our user study results show pixel-level annotation can significantly improve the user experience. Compared with semantic and instance segmentation pixel retrieval requires a fine-grained recognition capability for variable-granularity targets. To this end we propose pixel retrieval benchmarks named PROxford and PRParis which are based on the widely used image retrieval datasets ROxford and RParis. Three professional annotators label 5942 images with two rounds of double-checking and refinement. Furthermore we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on the SOTA methods in image search image matching detection segmentation and dense matching using our pixel retrieval benchmarks. Results show that the pixel retrieval task is challenging to these approaches and distinctive from existing problems suggesting that further research can advance the content-based pixel-retrieval and thus user search experience.

	<td><p>Automatic evaluation of hashtag recommendation models is a fundamental task in many online social network systems. In the traditional evaluation method the recommended hashtags from an algorithm are firstly compared with the ground truth hashtags for exact correspondences. The number of exact matches is then used to calculate the hit rate hit ratio precision recall or F1-score. This way of evaluating hashtag similarities is inadequate as it ignores the semantic correlation between the recommended and ground truth hashtags. To tackle this problem we propose a novel semantic evaluation framework for hashtag recommendation called REval. This framework includes an internal module referred to as BERTag which automatically learns the hashtag embeddings. We investigate on how the REval framework performs under different word embedding methods and different numbers of synonyms and hashtags in the recommendation using our proposed REval-hit-ratio measure. Our experiments of the proposed framework on three large datasets show that REval gave more meaningful hashtag synonyms for hashtag recommendation evaluation. Our analysis also highlights the sensitivity of the framework to the word embedding technique with REval based on BERTag more superior over REval based on FastText and Word2Vec.</p>

Retrieving those vectors among millions and billions that are similar to a given query is a ubiquitous problem known as similarity search of relevance for a wide range of applications. Graph-based indices are currently the best performing techniques for billion-scale similarity search. However their random-access memory pattern presents challenges to realize their full potential. In this work we present new techniques and systems for creating faster and smaller graph-based indices. To this end we introduce a novel vector compression method Locally-adaptive Vector Quantization (LVQ) that uses per-vector scaling and scalar quantization to improve search performance with fast similarity computations and a reduced effective bandwidth while decreasing memory footprint and barely impacting accuracy. LVQ when combined with a new high-performance computing system for graph-based similarity search establishes the new state of the art in terms of performance and memory footprint. For billions of vectors LVQ outcompetes the second-best alternatives (1) in the low-memory regime by up to 20.7x in throughput with up to a 3x memory footprint reduction and (2) in the high-throughput regime by 5.8x with 1.4x less memory.</p>

	<td><p>Cuckoo hashing is a powerful primitive that enables storing items using small space with efficient querying. At a high level cuckoo hashing maps n items into b entries storing at most ell items such that each item is placed into one of k randomly chosen entries. Additionally there is an overflow stash that can store at most s items. Many cryptographic primitives rely upon cuckoo hashing to privately embed and query data where it is integral to ensure small failure probability when constructing cuckoo hashing tables as it directly relates to the privacy guarantees. As our main result we present a more query-efficient cuckoo hashing construction using more hash functions. For construction failure probability epsilon the query overhead of our scheme is O(1 + ). Our scheme has quadratically smaller query overhead than prior works for any target failure probability epsilon. We also prove lower bounds matching our construction. Our improvements come from a new understanding of the locality of cuckoo hashing failures for small sets of items. We also initiate the study of robust cuckoo hashing where the input set may be chosen with knowledge of the hash functions. We present a cuckoo hashing scheme using more hash functions with query overhead (log lambda) that is robust against poly(lambda) adversaries. Furthermore we present lower bounds showing that this construction is tight and that extending previous approaches of large stashes or entries cannot obtain robustness except with Omega(n) query overhead. As applications of our results we obtain improved constructions for batch codes and PIR. In particular we present the most efficient explicit batch code and blackbox reduction from single-query PIR to batch PIR.</p>

Specifically we enable the image understanding ability of the well-trained dense retriever T5-ANCE by incorporating the visual modules encoded image features as its inputs. To facilitate the multi-modal retrieval tasks we build the ClueWeb22-MM dataset based on the ClueWeb22 dataset which regards anchor texts as queries and extracts the related text and image documents from anchor-linked web pages. Our experiments show that MARVEL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the multi-modal retrieval dataset WebQA and ClueWeb22-MM. MARVEL provides an opportunity to broaden the advantages of text retrieval to the multi-modal scenario.

	<td><p>Cross-encoder models which jointly encode and score a query-item pair are prohibitively expensive for direct k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search. Consequently k-NN search typically employs a fast approximate retrieval (e.g. using BM25 or dual-encoder vectors) followed by reranking with a cross-encoder; however the retrieval approximation often has detrimental recall regret. This problem is tackled by ANNCUR (Yadav et al. 2022) a recent work that employs a cross-encoder only making search efficient using a relatively small number of anchor items and a CUR matrix factorization. While ANNCURs one-time selection of anchors tends to approximate the cross-encoder distances on average doing so forfeits the capacity to accurately estimate distances to items near the query leading to regret in the crucial end-task recall of top-k items. In this paper we propose ADACUR a method that adaptively iteratively and efficiently minimizes the approximation error for the practically important top-k neighbors. It does so by iteratively performing k-NN search using the anchors available so far then adding these retrieved nearest neighbors to the anchor set for the next round. Empirically on multiple datasets in comparison to previous traditional and state-of-the-art methods such as ANNCUR and dual-encoder-based retrieve-and-rerank our proposed approach ADACUR consistently reduces recall error-by up to 70 on the important k = 1 setting-while using no more compute than its competitors.</p>

Among them deep learning-based hashing achieves better performance on large-scale data due to its excellent extraction and representation ability for nonlinear heterogeneous features. However there are still two main challenges in catastrophic forgetting when data with new categories arrive continuously and time-consuming for non-continuous hashing retrieval to retrain for updating. To this end we in this paper propose a novel deep lifelong cross-modal hashing to achieve lifelong hashing retrieval instead of re-training hash function repeatedly when new data arrive. Specifically we design lifelong learning strategy to update hash functions by directly training the incremental data instead of retraining new hash functions using all the accumulated data which significantly reduce training time. Then we propose lifelong hashing loss to enable original hash codes participate in lifelong learning but remain invariant and further preserve the similarity and dis-similarity among original and incremental hash codes to maintain performance. Additionally considering distribution heterogeneity when new data arriving continuously we introduce multi-label semantic similarity to supervise hash learning and it has been proven that the similarity improves performance with detailed analysis. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieves comparative performance comparing with recent state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods and it yields substantial average increments over 20 in retrieval accuracy and almost reduces over 80 training time when new data arrives continuously.</p>

In this work we propose Search-based Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning (SUVR) to learn better image representations in an unsupervised manner. We first construct a graph from the image dataset by the similarity between images and adopt the concept of graph traversal to explore positive samples. In the meantime we make sure that negative samples can be drawn from the full dataset. Quantitative experiments on five benchmark image classification datasets demonstrate that SUVR can significantly outperform strong competing methods on unsupervised embedding learning. Qualitative experiments also show that SUVR can produce better representations in which similar images are clustered closer together than unrelated images in the latent space.</p>

The study shows that embedding a message via integer wavelet transform and compression with Karhunen-Loeve-transform yields the best results. However it was not possible to distinguish between manipulation and compression in all cases.</p>

	<td><p>Image-text retrieval requires the system to bridge the heterogenous gap between vision and language for accurate retrieval while keeping the network lightweight-enough for efficient retrieval. Existing trade-off solutions mainly study from the view of incorporating cross-modal interactions with the independent-embedding framework or leveraging stronger pretrained encoders which still demand time-consuming similarity measurement or heavyweight model structure in the retrieval stage. In this work we propose an image-text alignment module SelfAlign on top of the independent-embedding framework which improves the retrieval accuracy while maintains the retrieval efficiency without extra supervision. SelfAlign contains two collaborative sub-modules that force image-text alignment at both concept level and context level by self-supervised contrastive learning. It does not require cross-modal embedding interactions during training while maintaining independent image and text encoders during retrieval. With comparable time cost SelfAlign consistently boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art non-pretraining independent-embedding models respectively by 9.1 4.2 and 6.6 in terms of R@sum score on Flickr30K MSCOCO 1K and MS-COCO 5K datasets. The retrieval accuracy also outperforms most existing interactive-embedding models with orders of magnitude decrease in retrieval time.

It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically based on the captured visual representations by attention we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then driven by preserving original entities similarity the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Compressing videos into binary codes can improve retrieval speed and reduce storage overhead. However learning accurate hash codes for video retrieval can be challenging due to high local redundancy and complex global dependencies between video frames especially in the absence of labels. Existing self-supervised video hashing methods have been effective in designing expressive temporal encoders but have not fully utilized the temporal dynamics and spatial appearance of videos due to less challenging and unreliable learning tasks. To address these challenges we begin by utilizing the contrastive learning task to capture global spatio-temporal information of videos for hashing. With the aid of our designed augmentation strategies which focus on spatial and temporal variations to create positive pairs the learning framework can generate hash codes that are invariant to motion scale and viewpoint. Furthermore we incorporate two collaborative learning tasks i.e. frame order verification and scene change regularization to capture local spatio-temporal details within video frames thereby enhancing the perception of temporal structure and the modeling of spatio-temporal relationships. Our proposed Contrastive Hashing with Global-Local Spatio-temporal Information (CHAIN) outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised video hashing methods on four video benchmark datasets.

Previous efforts formulate video hashing as training a binary auto-encoder, for which noncontinuous latent representations are optimized by the biased straight-through (ST) back-propagation heuristic. We propose to formulate video hashing as learning a discrete variational auto-encoder with the factorized Bernoulli latent distribution, termed as Bernoulli variational auto-encoder (BerVAE). The corresponding evidence lower bound (ELBO) in our BerVAE implementation leads to closed-form gradient expression, which can be applied to achieve principled training along with some other unbiased gradient estimators. BerVAE enables uncertainty-aware video hashing by predicting the probability distribution of video hash code-words, thus providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Experiments on both simulated and real-world large-scale video data demonstrate that our BerVAE trained with unbiased gradient estimators can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Furthermore, we show that quantified uncertainty is highly correlated to video retrieval performance, which can be leveraged to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

	<td><p>Representing visual data using compact binary codes is attracting increasing attention as binary codes are used as direct indices into hash table(s) for fast non-exhaustive search. Recent methods show that ranking binary codes using weighted Hamming distance (WHD) rather than Hamming distance (HD) by generating query-adaptive weights for each bit can better retrieve query-related items. However search using WHD is slower than that using HD. One main challenge is that the complexity of extending a monotone increasing sequence using WHD to probe buckets in hash table(s) for existing methods is at least proportional to the square of the sequence length while that using HD is proportional to the sequence length. To overcome this challenge we propose a novel fast non-exhaustive search method using WHD. The key idea is to design a constant sequence extension algorithm to perform each sequence extension in constant computational complexity and the total complexity is proportional to the sequence length which is justified by theoretical analysis. Experimental results show that our method is faster than other WHD-based search methods. Also compared with the HD-based non-exhaustive search method our method has comparable efficiency but retrieves more query-related items for the dataset of up to one billion items.</p>

Among the many retrieval methods hashing methods are widely used due to their high efficiency and small storage space occupation. Fine-grained hashing is more challenging than traditional hashing problems due to the difficulties such as low inter-class variances and high intra-class variances caused by the characteristics of fine-grained images. To improve the retrieval accuracy of fine-grained hashing we propose a cascaded network to learn compact and highly semantic hash codes and introduce an attention-guided data augmentation method. We refer to this network as a cascaded hierarchical data augmentation network. We also propose a novel approach to coordinately balance the loss of multi-task learning.

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been intensively studied and successfully applied in large-scale image retrieval systems due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models that is adversarial vulnerability. Notably it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further we for the first time formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms meanwhile the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

More importantly different from existing attention mechanism simply erasing previous discriminative regions our SEM is developed to restrain such regions and then discover other complementary regions by considering the relation between activated regions in a stage-by-stage fashion. In each stage the interactive channel transformation (ICON) module is afterwards designed to exploit correlations across channels of attended activation tensors. Since channels could generally correspond to the parts of fine-grained objects the part correlation can be also modeled accordingly which further improves fine-grained retrieval accuracy. Moreover to be computational economy ICON is realized by an efficient two-step process. Finally the hash learning of our SEMICON consists of both global- and local-level branches for better representing fine-grained objects and then generating binary hash codes explicitly corresponding to multiple levels.

This paper shows that the presence of noise removes such constrain in high-dimensions in other words sparse embeddings such as subsampling and hashing with comparable embedding dimensions to dense embeddings have similar approximate norm-preserving dimensionality-reduction properties. The key is that the noise should be treated as an information to be exploited not simply something to be removed. Theoretical bounds for subsampling and hashing to recover the approximate norm of a high dimension vector in the presence of noise are derived with numerical illustrations showing better performances are achieved in the presence of noise.</p>

	<td><p>Transformer-based pre-trained language models are vocabulary-dependent mapping by default each token to its corresponding embedding. This one-to-one mapping results into embedding matrices that occupy a lot of memory (i.e. millions of parameters) and grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Previous work on on-device transformers dynamically generate token embeddings on-the-fly without embedding matrices using locality-sensitive hashing over morphological information. These embeddings are subsequently fed into transformer layers for text classification. However these methods are not pre-trained. Inspired by this line of work we propose HashFormers a new family of vocabulary-independent pre-trained transformers that support an unlimited vocabulary (i.e. all possible tokens in a corpus) given a substantially smaller fixed-sized embedding matrix. We achieve this by first introducing computationally cheap hashing functions that bucket together individual tokens to embeddings. We also propose three variants that do not require an embedding matrix at all further reducing the memory requirements. We empirically demonstrate that HashFormers are more memory efficient compared to standard pre-trained transformers while achieving comparable predictive performance when fine-tuned on multiple text classification tasks. For example our most efficient HashFormer variant has a negligible performance degradation (0.4 on GLUE) using only 99.1K parameters for representing the embeddings compared to 12.3-38M parameters of state-of-the-art models.</p>

To address these issues in this paper we propose to leverage BERT embeddings to perform efficient retrieval based on the product quantization technique which will assign for every document a real-valued codeword from the codebook instead of a binary code as in semantic hashing. Specifically we first transform the original BERT embeddings via a learnable mapping and feed the transformed embedding into a probabilistic product quantization module to output the assigned codeword. The refining and quantizing modules can be optimized in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the probabilistic contrastive loss. A mutual information maximization based method is further proposed to improve the representativeness of codewords so that documents can be quantized more accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Minimal perfect hashing is the problem of mapping a static set of n distinct keys into the address space 1ldotsn bijectively. It is well-known that nlog_2(e) bits are necessary to specify a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) f when no additional knowledge of the input keys is to be used. However it is often the case in practice that the input keys have intrinsic relationships that we can exploit to lower the bit complexity of f. For example consider a string and the set of all its distinct k-mers as input keys since two consecutive k-mers share an overlap of k-1 symbols it seems possible to beat the classic log_2(e) bits/key barrier in this case. Moreover we would like f to map consecutive k-mers to consecutive addresses as to also preserve as much as possible their relationship in the codomain. This is a useful feature in practice as it guarantees a certain degree of locality of reference for f resulting in a better evaluation time when querying consecutive k-mers. Motivated by these premises we initiate the study of a new type of locality-preserving MPHF designed for k-mers extracted consecutively from a collection of strings. We design a construction whose space usage decreases for growing k and discuss experiments with a practical implementation of the method in practice the functions built with our method can be several times smaller and even faster to query than the most efficient MPHFs in the literature.</p>

	<td><p>Modern hash table designs strive to minimize space while maximizing speed. The most important factor in speed is the number of cache lines accessed during updates and queries. This is especially important on PMEM which is slower than DRAM and in which writes are more expensive than reads. This paper proposes two stronger design objectives stability and low-associativity. A stable hash table doesnt move items around and a hash table has low associativity if there are only a few locations where an item can be stored. Low associativity ensures that queries need to examine only a few memory locations and stability ensures that insertions write to very few cache lines. Stability also simplifies scaling and crash safety. We present IcebergHT a fast crash-safe concurrent and space-efficient hash table for PMEM based on the design principles of stability and low associativity. IcebergHT combines in-memory metadata with a new hashing technique iceberg hashing that is (1) space efficient (2) stable and (3) supports low associativity. In contrast existing hash-tables either modify numerous cache lines during insertions (e.g. cuckoo hashing) access numerous cache lines during queries (e.g. linear probing) or waste space (e.g. chaining). Moreover the combination of (1)-(3) yields several emergent benefits IcebergHT scales better than other hash tables supports crash-safety and has excellent performance on PMEM (where writes are particularly expensive).</p>

	<td><p>Due to the continuous growth of large-scale multi-modal data and increasing requirements for retrieval speed, deep cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention recently. Most of existing studies take a similarity matrix as supervision to optimize their models, and the inner product between continuous surrogates of hash codes is utilized to depict the similarity in the Hamming space. However, all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix, ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one, i.e., the categories that samples do not belong to. Therefore, they cannot effectively alleviate the effect of dissimilar samples. Moreover, due to the modality distribution difference, directly utilizing continuous surrogates of hash codes to calculate similarity may induce suboptimal retrieval performance. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep normalized cross-modal hashing scheme with bi-direction relation reasoning, named Bi_NCMH. Specifically, we build the multi-level semantic similarity matrix by considering bi-direction relation, i.e., consistent and inconsistent relation. It hence can holistically characterize relations among instances. Besides, we execute feature normalization on continuous surrogates of hash codes to eliminate the deviation caused by modality gap, which further reduces the negative impact of binarization on retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on two cross-modal benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Thus existing content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems in RS require decoding images before applying CBIR (which is computationally demanding in the case of large-scale CBIR problems). To address this problem in this paper we present a joint framework that simultaneously learns RS image compression and indexing. Thus it eliminates the need for decoding RS images before applying CBIR. The proposed framework is made up of two modules. The first module compresses RS images based on an auto-encoder architecture. The second module produces hash codes with a high discrimination capability by employing soft pairwise bit-balancing and classification loss functions. We also introduce a two stage learning strategy with gradient manipulation techniques to obtain image representations that are compatible with both RS image indexing and compression. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework when compared to widely used approaches in RS.

	<td><p>Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) aiming at searching for a set of similar items to a given query image is a very important task in remote sensing applications. Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method has achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand various deep neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images. On the other hand the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way. However with the number of database samples increasing it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of large-scale database images. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL) for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

	<td><p>Modern high load applications store data using multiple database instances. Such an architecture requires data consistency and it is important to ensure even distribution of data among nodes. Load balancing is used to achieve these goals. Hashing is the backbone of virtually all load balancing systems. Since the introduction of classic Consistent Hashing many algorithms have been devised for this purpose. One of the purposes of the load balancer is to ensure storage cluster scalability. It is crucial for the performance of the whole system to transfer as few data records as possible during node addition or removal. The load balancer hashing algorithm has the greatest impact on this process. In this paper we experimentally evaluate several hashing algorithms used for load balancing conducting both simulated and real system experiments. To evaluate algorithm performance we have developed a benchmark suite based on Unidata MDM~ â a scalable toolkit for various Master Data Management (MDM) applications. For assessment we have employed three criteria~ â uniformity of the produced distribution the number of moved records and computation speed. Following the results of our experiments we have created a table in which each algorithm is given an assessment according to the abovementioned criteria.</p>

In this work we propose a jointly learned deep hashing and quantization network (HQ) for cross-modal retrieval. We simultaneously learn binary hash codes and quantization codes to preserve semantic information in multiple modalities by an end-to-end deep learning architecture. At the retrieval step binary hashing is used to retrieve a subset of items from the search space then quantization is used to re-rank the retrieved items. We theoretically and empirically show that this two-stage retrieval approach provides faster retrieval results while preserving accuracy. Experimental results on the NUS-WIDE MIR-Flickr and Amazon datasets demonstrate that HQ achieves boosts of more than 7 in precision compared to supervised neural network-based compact coding models.</p>

Typically to guarantee generalization the pre-defined class embeddings from natural language processing (NLP) models are used to build a common space. In this paper instead of using an extra NLP model to define a common space beforehand we consider a totally different way to construct (or learn) a common hamming space from an information-theoretic perspective. We term our model the Information-Theoretic Hashing (ITH) which is composed of two cascading modules an Adaptive Information Aggregation (AIA) module; and a Semantic Preserving Encoding (SPE) module. Specifically our AIA module takes the inspiration from the Principle of Relevant Information (PRI) to construct a common space that adaptively aggregates the intrinsic semantics of different modalities of data and filters out redundant or irrelevant information. On the other hand our SPE module further generates the hashing codes of different modalities by preserving the similarity of intrinsic semantics with the element-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. A total correlation regularization term is also imposed to reduce the redundancy amongst different dimensions of hash codes. Sufficient experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ITH in ZS-CMR. Source code is available in the supplementary material.</p>

	<td><p>Recently to improve the unsupervised image retrieval performance plenty of unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed by designing a semantic similarity matrix which is based on the similarities between image features extracted by a pre-trained CNN model. However most of these methods tend to ignore high-level abstract semantic concepts contained in images. Intuitively concepts play an important role in calculating the similarity among images. In real-world scenarios each image is associated with some concepts and the similarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical concepts. Inspired by the above intuition in this work we propose a novel Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining called UHSCM which leverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix. Specifically a set of randomly chosen concepts is first collected. Then by employing a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model with the prompt engineering which has shown strong power in visual representation learning the set of concepts is denoised according to the training images. Next the proposed method UHSCM applies the VLP model with prompting again to mine the concept distribution of each image and construct a high-quality semantic similarity matrix based on the mined concept distributions. Finally with the semantic similarity matrix as guiding information a novel hashing loss with a modified contrastive loss based regularization item is proposed to optimize the hashing network. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.</p>

Theoretically we prove that CCE is guaranteed to converge to the optimal codebook and give a tight bound for the number of iterations required.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing still has some challenges needed to address (1) most existing CMH methods take graphs as input to model data distribution. These methods omit to consider the correlation of graph structure among multiple modalities; (2) most existing CMH methods ignores considering the fusion affinity among multi-modalities data; (3) most existing CMH methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization objective significantly degrading the retrieval performance. To solve the above limitations we propose a novel Anchor Graph Structure Fusion Hashing (AGSFH). AGSFH constructs the anchor graph structure fusion matrix from different anchor graphs of multiple modalities with the Hadamard product which can fully exploit the geometric property of underlying data structure. Based on the anchor graph structure fusion matrix AGSFH attempts to directly learn an intrinsic anchor graph where the structure of the intrinsic anchor graph is adaptively tuned so that the number of components of the intrinsic graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters. Besides AGSFH preserves the anchor fusion affinity into the common binary Hamming space. Furthermore a discrete optimization framework is designed to learn the unified binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three public social datasets demonstrate the superiority of AGSFH.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing has attracted much attention for binary representation learning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary codes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with similarity preservation between instances. However most existing methods learn hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local geometric structures (i.e. pairwise relationships) of data and lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To address this challenge in this work we propose an effective unsupervised method namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH) for binary representation learning. To be specific firstly we propose a novel personalized hashing module i.e. Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes for different clusters adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to the same Hamming space. In addition we deploy sparse constraints for different personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding over-fitting. Then to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise similarities in our JPSH we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash learning into the seamless formulation. As such JPSH not only distinguishes the instances from different clusters but also preserves local neighborhood structures within the cluster. Finally an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.</p>

However Hash-CF often faces two challenging problems i.e. optimization on discrete representations and preserving semantic information in learned representations. To address the above two challenges we propose HCFRec a novel Hash-CF approach for effective and efficient recommendations.

	<td><p>Similarity query is the family of queries based on some similarity metrics. Unlike the traditional database queries which are mostly based on value equality similarity queries aim to find targets similar enough to the given data objects depending on some similarity metric e.g. Euclidean distance cosine similarity and so on. To measure the similarity between data objects traditional methods normally work on low level or syntax features(e.g. basic visual features on images or bag-of-word features of text) which makes them weak to compute the semantic similarities between objects. So for measuring data similarities semantically neural embedding is applied. Embedding techniques work by representing the raw data objects as vectors (so called embeddings or neural embeddings since they are mostly generated by neural network models) that expose the hidden semantics of the raw data based on which embeddings do show outstanding effectiveness on capturing data similarities making it one of the most widely used and studied techniques in the state-of-the-art similarity query processing research. But there are still many open challenges on the efficiency of embedding based similarity query processing which are not so well-studied as the effectiveness. In this survey we first provide an overview of the similarity query and similarity query processing problems. Then we talk about recent approaches on designing the indexes and operators for highly efficient similarity query processing on top of embeddings (or more generally high dimensional data). Finally we investigate the specific solutions with and without using embeddings in selected application domains of similarity queries including entity resolution and information retrieval. By comparing the solutions we show how neural embeddings benefit those applications.</p>

Sivic brings a significant acceleration by reducing distance computations with only a small fraction of the database. The state-of-the-art inverted indices aim to build finer partitions that produce a concise and accurate candidate list. However partitioning in these frameworks is generally achieved by unsupervised clustering methods which ignore the semantic information of images. In this paper we replace the clustering method with image classification during the construction of codebook. We then propose a merging and splitting method to solve the problem that the number of partitions is unchangeable in the inverted semantic-index. Next we combine our semantic-index with the product quantization (PQ) so as to alleviate the accuracy loss caused by PQ compression. Finally we evaluate our model on large-scale image retrieval benchmarks. Experiment results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the retrieval accuracy by generating high-quality candidate lists.</p>

For instance considering hashtags as auxiliary information we can hypothesize that an Instagram image will be semantically more similar with the same hashtags. With this intuition we present a two-stage weakly-supervised contrastive learning approach. The first stage is to cluster data according to its auxiliary information. The second stage is to learn similar representations within the same cluster and dissimilar representations for data from different clusters. Our empirical experiments suggest the following three contributions. First compared to conventional self-supervised representations the auxiliary-information-infused representations bring the performance closer to the supervised representations which use direct downstream labels as supervision signals. Second our approach performs the best in most cases when comparing our approach with other baseline representation learning methods that also leverage auxiliary data information. Third we show that our approach also works well with unsupervised constructed clusters (e.g. no auxiliary information) resulting in a strong unsupervised representation learning approach.</p>

These systems deploy indexing methods which quantize fingerprints to hash codes in an unsupervised manner to expedite the search. However these methods generate imbalanced hash codes leading to their suboptimal performance. Therefore we propose a self-supervised learning framework to compute fingerprints and balanced hash codes in an end-to-end manner to achieve both fast and accurate retrieval performance. We model hash codes as a balanced clustering process which we regard as an instance of the optimal transport problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach improves retrieval efficiency while preserving high accuracy particularly at high distortion levels compared to the competing methods.

	<td><p>Similarity search based on a distance function in metric spaces is a fundamental problem for many applications. Queries for similar objects lead to the well-known machine learning task of nearest-neighbours identification. Many data indexing strategies collectively known as Metric Access Methods (MAM) have been proposed to speed up queries for similar elements in this context. Moreover since exact approaches to solve similarity queries can be complex and time-consuming alternative options have appeared to reduce query execution time such as returning approximate results or resorting to distributed computing platforms. In this paper we introduce MASK (Multilevel Approximate Similarity search with k-means) an unconventional application of the k-means algorithm as the foundation of a multilevel index structure for approximate similarity search suitable for metric spaces. We show that inherent properties of k-means like representing high-density data areas with fewer prototypes can be leveraged for this purpose. An implementation of this new indexing method is evaluated using a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset in a high-dimensional and high-sparsity space. Results are promising and underpin the applicability of this novel indexing method in multiple domains.</p>

To reduce the memory footprint the default embedding layer in spaCy is a hash embeddings layer. It is a stochastic approximation of traditional embeddings that provides unique vectors for a large number of words without explicitly storing a separate vector for each of them. To be able to compute meaningful representations for both known and unknown words hash embeddings represent each word as a summary of the normalized word form subword information and word shape. Together these features produce a multi-embedding of a word. In this technical report we lay out a bit of history and introduce the embedding methods in spaCy in detail.

Most of the existing methods assume that a reliable multi-modal training set with accurately matched text-image pairs is existing. However this assumption may not always hold since the multi-modal training sets may include noisy pairs (i.e. textual descriptions/captions associated to training images can be noisy) distorting the learning process of the retrieval methods. To address this problem we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal hashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR). CHNR consists of three modules 1) feature extraction module which extracts feature representations of image-text pairs; 2) noise detection module which detects potential noisy correspondences; and 3) hashing module that generates cross-modal binary hash codes. The proposed CHNR includes two training phases i) meta-learning phase that uses a small portion of clean (i.e. reliable) data to train the noise detection module in an adversarial fashion; and ii) the main training phase for which the trained noise detection module is used to identify noisy correspondences while the hashing module is trained on the noisy multi-modal training set. Experimental results show that the proposed CHNR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at httpsgit.tu-berlin.de/rsim/chnr</p>

In this paper we focus our attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval where queries from one modality (e.g. text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g. image). Most of the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems require a high number of labeled training samples and also do not allow fast and memory-efficient retrieval due to their intrinsic characteristics. These issues limit the applicability of the existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale applications in RS. To address this problem in this paper we introduce a novel deep unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for RS text-image retrieval. The proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules 1) feature extraction module (which extracts deep representations of the text-image modalities); and 2) hashing module (which learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations). Within the hashing module we introduce a novel multi-objective loss function including i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in both intra- and inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is enforced across two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; iii) binarization objectives for generating representative hash codes. Experimental results show that the proposed DUCH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods on two multi-modal (image and text) benchmark archives in RS. Our code is publicly available at httpsgit.tu-berlin.de/rsim/duch.</p>

	<td><p>The development of cross-modal retrieval systems that can search and retrieve semantically relevant data across different modalities based on a query in any modality has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). In this paper we focus our attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval where queries from one modality (e.g. text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g. image). Most of the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems in RS require a high number of labeled training samples and also do not allow fast and memory-efficient retrieval. These issues limit the applicability of the existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale applications in RS. To address this problem in this paper we introduce a novel unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for text-image retrieval in RS. To this end the proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules 1) feature extraction module which extracts deep representations of two modalities; 2) hashing module that learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations. We introduce a novel multi-objective loss function including i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in intra- and inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is enforced across two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; and iii) binarization objectives for generating hash codes. Experimental results show that the proposed DUCH outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at httpsgit.tu-berlin.de/rsim/duch.</p>

	<td><p>Case-based Reasoning (CBR) on high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is a trending yet challenging and computationally expensive task in the real world. A promising approach is to obtain low-dimensional hash codes representing cases and perform a similarity retrieval of cases in Hamming space. However previous methods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual construction inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g. high-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data characteristics. To address these issues this work introduces a novel deep hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR. Specifically we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then we feed the case embeddings into fully-connected layers and subsequently a hash layer generates hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss during relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR we further propose an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that HeCBR greatly reduces storage and significantly accelerates case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance compared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly better than hashing-based CBR methods in classification.</p>

To screen out redundant feature vectors we introduce a hashing screening mechanism for multi-grained scanning and propose a model called HW-Forest which adopts two strategies hashing screening and window screening. HW-Forest employs perceptual hashing algorithm to calculate the similarity between feature vectors in hashing screening strategy which is used to remove the redundant feature vectors produced by multi-grained scanning and can significantly decrease the time cost and memory consumption. Furthermore we adopt a self-adaptive instance screening strategy to improve the performance of our approach called window screening which can achieve higher accuracy without hyperparameter tuning on different datasets. Our experimental results show that HW-Forest has higher accuracy than other models and the time cost is also reduced.</p>

	<td><p>Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption learning to hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However existing hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper we propose a Generalized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem which encounters two crucial bottlenecks 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains leading to an inevitable domain distribution gap; 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned bringing up an additional feature gap. To address the GITR problem we propose an Asymmetric Transfer Hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised realizations. Specifically ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile to alleviate negative transfer the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks indicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of multimodal media data on the Web in recent years hash learning methods as a way to achieve efficient and flexible cross-modal retrieval of massive multimedia data have received a lot of attention from the current Web resource retrieval research community. Existing supervised hashing methods simply transform label information into pairwise similarity information to guide hash learning leading to a potential risk of semantic error in the face of multi-label data. In addition most existing hash optimization methods solve NP-hard optimization problems by employing approximate approximation strategies based on relaxation strategies leading to a large quantization error. In order to address above obstacles we present a simple yet efficient Adaptive Asymmetric Label-guided Hashing named A2LH for Multimedia Search. Specifically A2LH is a two-step hashing method. In the first step we design an association representation model between the different modality representations and semantic label representation separately and use the semantic label representation as an intermediate bridge to solve the semantic gap existing between different modalities. In addition we present an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for solving the quantization error problem caused by relaxation-based optimization algorithms. In the second step we leverage the generated hash codes to learn the hash mapping functions. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves optimal performance on all compared baseline methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel method called prototype-based layered federated cross-modal hashing. Specifically the prototype is introduced to learn the similarity between instances and classes on server reducing the impact of statistical heterogeneity (non-IID) on different clients. And we monitor the distance between local and global prototypes to further improve the performance. To realize personalized federated learning a hypernetwork is deployed on server to dynamically update different layers weights of local model.

Unlike previous work simply indexing into a moderately small database using an object shape descriptor and accepting the top retrieval result we argue that in the case of a large-scale database a more accurate model may be found within a neighborhood of the descriptor. More importantly we propose that the distinctiveness deficiency of shape descriptors at the instance level can be compensated by a geometry-based re-ranking of its neighborhood. Our approach first leverages the discriminative power of learned representations to distinguish between different categories of models and then uses a novel robust point set distance metric to re-rank the CAD neighborhood enabling fine-grained retrieval in a large shape database. Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that our geometry-based re-ranking is a conceptually simple but highly effective method that can lead to a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

To reduce the embedding dimensions of dense retrieval this paper proposes a Conditional Autoencoder (ConAE) to compress the high-dimensional embeddings to maintain the same embedding distribution and better recover the ranking features.

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval tasks owing to efficient computation and low storage cost by encoding high-dimensional image data into binary codes. Since binary codes do not contain as much information as float features the essence of binary encoding is preserving the main context to guarantee retrieval quality. However the existing hashing methods have great limitations on suppressing redundant background information and accurately encoding from Euclidean space to Hamming space by a simple sign function. In order to solve these problems a Cross-Scale Context Extracted Hashing Network (CSCE-Net) is proposed in this paper. Firstly we design a two-branch framework to capture fine-grained local information while maintaining high-level global semantic information. Besides Attention guided Information Extraction module (AIE) is introduced between two branches which suppresses areas of low context information cooperated with global sliding windows. Unlike previous methods our CSCE-Net learns a content-related Dynamic Sign Function (DSF) to replace the original simple sign function. Therefore the proposed CSCE-Net is context-sensitive and able to perform well on accurate image binary encoding. We further demonstrate that our CSCE-Net is superior to the existing hashing methods which improves retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Deep unsupervised hashing has been appreciated in the regime of image retrieval. However most prior arts failed to detect the semantic components and their relationships behind the images which makes them lack discriminative power. To make up the defect we propose a novel Deep Semantic Components Hashing (DSCH) which involves a common sense that an image normally contains a bunch of semantic components with homology and co-occurrence relationships. Based on this prior DSCH regards the semantic components as latent variables under the Expectation-Maximization framework and designs a two-step iterative algorithm with the objective of maximum likelihood of training data. Firstly DSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained semantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM) where an image is represented as a mixture of multiple components and the semantics co-occurrence are exploited. Besides coarse-grained semantics components are discovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained components and the hierarchy organization is then constructed. Secondly DSCH makes the images close to their semantic component centers at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels and also makes the images share similar semantic components close to each other. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical semantic components indeed facilitate the hashing model to achieve superior performance.</p>

Many metric learning loss functions focus on learning a correct ranking of training samples but strongly overfit semantically inconsistent labels and require a large amount of data. To address these shortcomings we propose a new metric learning method called contextual loss which optimizes contextual similarity in addition to cosine similarity. Our contextual loss implicitly enforces semantic consistency among neighbors while converging to the correct ranking. We empirically show that the proposed loss is more robust to label noise and is less prone to overfitting even when a large portion of train data is withheld. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art across four image retrieval benchmarks and multiple different evaluation settings.

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing is an important approach for multimodal data management and application. Existing unsupervised cross-modal hashing algorithms mainly rely on data features in pre-trained models to mine their similarity relationships. However their optimization objectives are based on the static metric between the original uni-modal features without further exploring data correlations during the training. In addition most of them mainly focus on association mining and alignment among pairwise instances in continuous space but ignore the latent structural correlations contained in the semantic hashing space. In this paper we propose an unsupervised hash learning framework namely Adaptive Structural Similarity Preservation Hashing (ASSPH) to solve the above problems. Firstly we propose an adaptive learning scheme with limited data and training batches to enrich semantic correlations of unlabeled instances during the training process and meanwhile to ensure a smooth convergence of the training process. Secondly we present an asymmetric structural semantic representation learning scheme. We introduce structural semantic metrics based on graph adjacency relations during the semantic reconstruction and correlation mining stage and meanwhile align the structure semantics in the hash space with an asymmetric binary optimization process. Finally we conduct extensive experiments to validate the enhancements of our work in comparison with existing works.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing is a successful method to solve large-scale multimedia retrieval issue. A lot of matrix factorization-based hashing methods are proposed. However the existing methods still struggle with a few problems such as how to generate the binary codes efficiently rather than directly relax them to continuity. In addition most of the existing methods choose to use an ntimes n similarity matrix for optimization which makes the memory and computation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable Cross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues. It firstly introduces a collective matrix factorization to learn a common latent space from the kernelized features of different modalities and then transforms the similarity matrix optimization to a distance-distance difference problem minimization with the help of semantic labels and common latent space. Hence the computational complexity of the ntimes n asymmetric optimization is relieved. In the generation of hash codes we also employ an orthogonal constraint of label information which is indispensable for search accuracy. So the redundancy of computation can be much reduced. For efficient optimization and scalable to large-scale datasets we adopt the two-step approach rather than optimizing simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Wiki MIRFlickr-25K and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that our ASCMH outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied in large-scale data retrieval due to its superior retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. However data are often scattered in data silos with privacy concerns so performing centralized data storage and retrieval is not always possible. Leveraging the concept of federated learning (FL) to perform deep hashing is a recent research trend. However existing frameworks mostly rely on the aggregation of the local deep hashing models which are trained by performing similarity learning with local skewed data only. Therefore they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a real federated environment. To overcome these challenges we propose a novel federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for each class. Globally the transmission of global prototypes with only one prototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost and privacy risk. Locally the use of global prototypes are maximized by jointly training a discriminator network and the local hashing network. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of the deep hashing model in the federated environments with non-IID data distributions.</p>

In this paper we present the PHF construction algorithm SicHash - Small Irregular Cuckoo Tables for Perfect Hashing. At its core SicHash uses a known technique It places objects in a cuckoo hash table and then stores the final hash function choice of each object in a retrieval data structure. We combine the idea with irregular cuckoo hashing where each object has a different number of hash functions. Additionally we use many small tables that we overload beyond their asymptotic maximum load factor. The most space efficient competitors often use brute force methods to determine the PHFs. SicHash provides a more direct construction algorithm that only rarely needs to recompute parts. Our implementation improves the state of the art in terms of space usage versus construction time for a wide range of configurations. At the same time it provides very fast queries.</p>

In Information Retrieval (IR) the ranking pipeline is generally decomposed in two stages the first stage focus on retrieving a candidate set from the whole collection. The second stage re-ranks the candidate set by relying on more complex models. Recently Siamese-BERT models have been used as first stage ranker to replace or complement the traditional bag-of-word models. However indexing and searching a large document collection require efficient similarity search on dense vectors and this is why ANN techniques come into play. Since composite codes are naturally sparse we first show how CCSA can learn efficient parallel inverted index thanks to an uniformity regularizer. Second CCSA can be used as a binary quantization method and we propose to combine it with the recent graph based ANN techniques. Our experiments on MSMARCO dataset reveal that CCSA outperforms IVF with product quantization. Furthermore CCSA binary quantization is beneficial for the index size and memory usage for the graph-based HNSW method while maintaining a good level of recall and MRR. Third we compare with recent supervised quantization methods for image retrieval and find that CCSA is able to outperform them.</p>

Here in some sense PaCHash beats a lower bound on the space consumption of k-perfect hashing. An implementation for fast SSDs needs about 5 bits of internal memory per block of external memory requires only one disk access (of variable length) per search operation and has small internal search overhead compared to the disk access cost. Our experiments show that it has lower space consumption than all previous approaches even when considering objects of identical size.</p>

	<td><p>Hashtag segmentation is the task of breaking a hashtag into its constituent tokens. Hashtags often encode the essence of user-generated posts along with information like topic and sentiment which are useful in downstream tasks. Hashtags prioritize brevity and are written in unique ways â transliterating and mixing languages spelling variations creative named entities. Benchmark datasets used for the hashtag segmentation task â STAN BOUN â are small in size and extracted from a single set of tweets. However datasets should reflect the variations in writing styles of hashtags and also account for domain and language specificity failing which the results will misrepresent model performance. We argue that model performance should be assessed on a wider variety of hashtags and datasets should be carefully curated. To this end we propose HashSet a dataset comprising of a) 1.9k manually annotated dataset; b) 3.3M loosely supervised dataset. HashSet dataset is sampled from a different set of tweets when compared to existing datasets and provides an alternate distribution of hashtags to build and validate hashtag segmentation models. We show that the performance of SOTA models for Hashtag Segmentation drops substantially on proposed dataset indicating that the proposed dataset provides an alternate set of hashtags to train and assess models.</p>

Second we propose a novel set prediction module to produce a set of embedding vectors that effectively captures diverse semantics of input by the slot attention mechanism.

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years a number of online hashing methods have emerged which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples especially in the multi-label case. In this paper we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

Approaches introduced to find exact searching techniques often use tree-based index structures which are known to suffer from the curse of the dimensionality problem that limits their performance. Approximate searching techniques prefer performance over accuracy and they return good enough results while achieving a better performance. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for high-dimensional spaces. One of the most time-consuming processes in LSH is to find the neighboring points in the projected spaces. An improved LSH-based index structure called radius-optimized Locality Sensitive Hashing (roLSH) has been proposed to utilize Machine Learning and efficiently find these neighboring points; thus further improve the overall performance of LSH. In this paper we extend roLSH by experimentally studying the effect of different types of famous Machine Learning techniques on overall performance. We compare ten regression techniques on four real-world datasets and show that Neural Network-based techniques are the best fit to be used in roLSH as their accuracy and performance trade-off are the best compared to the other techniques.</p>

Meanwhile extensive works have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples and exploring adversarial attack against deep hashing has attracted many research efforts. Nevertheless backdoor attack another famous threat to DNNs has not been studied for deep hashing yet. Although various backdoor attacks have been proposed in the field of image classification existing approaches failed to realize a truly imperceptive backdoor attack that enjoys invisible triggers and clean label setting simultaneously and they also cannot meet the intrinsic demand of image retrieval backdoor. In this paper we propose BadHash the first generative-based imperceptible backdoor attack against deep hashing which can effectively generate invisible and input-specific poisoned images with clean label. Specifically we first propose a new conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) pipeline to effectively generate poisoned samples. For any given benign image it seeks to generate a natural-looking poisoned counterpart with a unique invisible trigger. In order to improve the attack effectiveness we introduce a label-based contrastive learning network LabCLN to exploit the semantic characteristics of different labels which are subsequently used for confusing and misleading the target model to learn the embedded trigger. We finally explore the mechanism of backdoor attacks on image retrieval in the hash space. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify that BadHash can generate imperceptible poisoned samples with strong attack ability and transferability over state-of-the-art deep hashing schemes.</p>

In this paper we investigate the unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval task where class labels and pairing annotations are no longer a prerequisite for training. This is an extremely challenging task because there is no supervision for both in-domain feature representation learning and cross-domain alignment. We address both challenges by introducing 1) a new cluster-wise contrastive learning mechanism to help extract class semantic-aware features and 2) a novel distance-of-distance loss to effectively measure and minimize the domain discrepancy without any external supervision. Experiments on the Office-Home and DomainNet datasets consistently show the superior image retrieval accuracies of our framework over state-of-the-art approaches.

	<td><p>In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies. Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary codes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes intractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to the data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization techniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low complexity.</p>

	<td><p>Most cloud services and distributed applications rely on hashing algorithms that allow dynamic scaling of a robust and efficient hash table. Examples include AWS Google Cloud and BitTorrent. Consistent and rendezvous hashing are algorithms that minimize key remapping as the hash table resizes. While memory errors in large-scale cloud deployments are common neither algorithm offers both efficiency and robustness. Hyperdimensional Computing is an emerging computational model that has inherent efficiency robustness and is well suited for vector or hardware acceleration. We propose Hyperdimensional (HD) hashing and show that it has the efficiency to be deployed in large systems. Moreover a realistic level of memory errors causes more than 20 mismatches for consistent hashing while HD hashing remains unaffected.</p>

	<td><p>Nearest neighbor search (NNS) aims to locate the points in high-dimensional space that is closest to the query point. The brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible when the number of points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine such as searching large medical imaging databases disease classification diagnosis etc. With a focus on medical imaging this paper proposes DenseLinkSearch an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this given a medical database the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer approach on CLEF 2011 medical image retrieval task.

	<td><p>The performance of a zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) task is primarily affected by two challenges. The substantial domain gap between image and sketch features needs to be bridged while at the same time the side information has to be chosen tactfully. Existing literature has shown that varying the semantic side information greatly affects the performance of ZS-SBIR. To this end we propose a novel graph transformer based zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (GTZSR) framework for solving ZS-SBIR tasks which uses a novel graph transformer to preserve the topology of the classes in the semantic space and propagates the context-graph of the classes within the embedding features of the visual space. To bridge the domain gap between the visual features we propose minimizing the Wasserstein distance between images and sketches in a learned domain-shared space. We also propose a novel compatibility loss that further aligns the two visual domains by bridging the domain gap of one class with respect to the domain gap of all other classes in the training set. Experimental results obtained on the extended Sketchy TU-Berlin and QuickDraw datasets exhibit sharp improvements over the existing state-of-the-art methods in both ZS-SBIR and generalized ZS-SBIR.</p>

	<td><p>One common task in image forensics is to detect spliced images where multiple source images are composed to one output image. Most of the currently best performing splicing detectors leverage high-frequency artifacts. However after an image underwent strong compression most of the high frequency artifacts are not available anymore. In this work we explore an alternative approach to splicing detection which is potentially better suited for images in-the-wild subject to strong compression and downsampling. Our proposal is to model the color formation of an image. The color formation largely depends on variations at the scale of scene objects and is hence much less dependent on high-frequency artifacts. We learn a deep metric space that is on one hand sensitive to illumination color and camera white-point estimation but on the other hand insensitive to variations in object color. Large distances in the embedding space indicate that two image regions either stem from different scenes or different cameras. In our evaluation we show that the proposed embedding space outperforms the state of the art on images that have been subject to strong compression and downsampling. We confirm in two further experiments the dual nature of the metric space namely to both characterize the acquisition camera and the scene illuminant color. As such this work resides at the intersection of physics-based and statistical forensics with benefits from both sides.</p>

Hence how to preserving meaningful information of the original data is a critical problem. Inspired by the large-scale vision pre-training model known as ViT which has shown significant progress for learning visual representations in this paper we propose a simple information-preserving compressor to finetune the ViT model for the target unsupervised hashing task. Specifically from pixels to continuous features we first propose a feature-preserving module using the corrupted image as input to reconstruct the original feature from the pre-trained ViT model and the complete image so that the feature extractor can focus on preserving the meaningful information of original data. Secondly from continuous features to hash codes we propose a hashing-preserving module which aims to keep the semantic information from the pre-trained ViT model by using the proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence loss. Besides the quantization loss and the similarity loss are added to minimize the quantization error. Our method is very simple and achieves a significantly higher degree of MAP on three benchmark image datasets.</p>

Most existing VSE networks are trained by adopting a hard negatives loss function which learns an objective margin between the similarity of relevant and irrelevant image-description embedding pairs. However the objective margin in the hard negatives loss function is set as a fixed hyperparameter that ignores the semantic differences of the irrelevant image-description pairs. To address the challenge of measuring the optimal similarities between image-description pairs before obtaining the trained VSE networks this paper presents a novel approach that comprises two main parts (1) finds the underlying semantics of image descriptions; and (2) proposes a novel semantically enhanced hard negatives loss function where the learning objective is dynamically determined based on the optimal similarity scores between irrelevant image-description pairs. Extensive experiments were carried out by integrating the proposed methods into five state-of-the-art VSE networks that were applied to three benchmark datasets for cross-modal information retrieval tasks. The results revealed that the proposed methods achieved the best performance and can also be adopted by existing and future VSE networks.</p>

Several long-tail hashing methods have been proposed but they can not adapt for multi-modal data due to the complex interplay between labels and individuality and commonality information of multi-modal data. Furthermore CMH methods mostly mine the commonality of multi-modal data to learn hash codes which may override tail labels encoded by the individuality of respective modalities. In this paper we propose LtCMH (Long-tail CMH) to handle imbalanced multi-modal data. LtCMH firstly adopts auto-encoders to mine the individuality and commonality of different modalities by minimizing the dependency between the individuality of respective modalities and by enhancing the commonality of these modalities. Then it dynamically combines the individuality and commonality with direct features extracted from respective modalities to create meta features that enrich the representation of tail labels and binaries meta features to generate hash codes. LtCMH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-tail datasets and holds a better (or comparable) performance on datasets with balanced labels.</p>

Second an efficient but approximate similarity search algorithm trades scalability (size and speed) against quality of the search thereby introducing a source of error. This paper improves the robustness of image copy detection with active indexing that optimizes the interplay of these two components. We reduce the quantization loss of a given image representation by making imperceptible changes to the image before its release. The loss is back-propagated through the deep neural network back to the image under perceptual constraints. These modifications make the image more retrievable. Our experiments show that the retrieval and copy detection of activated images is significantly improved. For instance activation improves by +40 the Recall1@1 on various image transformations and for several popular indexing structures based on product quantization and locality sensitivity hashing.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel method namely Weighted Contrative Hashing (WCH) to take a step towards solving these two problems. We introduce a novel mutual attention module to alleviate the problem of information asymmetry in network features caused by the missing image structure during contrative augmentation. Furthermore we explore the fine-grained semantic relations between images i.e. we divide the images into multiple patches and calculate similarities between patches. The aggregated weighted similarities which reflect the deep image relations are distilled to facilitate the hash codes learning with a distillation loss so as to obtain better retrieval performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed WCH significantly outperforms existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmark datasets.</p>

The higher the dimensionality the larger the memory consumption and computational time for approaches using such descriptors. In this paper we investigate multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to extract low-dimensional but high-quality descriptors. We thoroughly analyze our method in unsupervised self-supervised and supervised settings and evaluate the dimensionality reduction results on four representative descriptors. We consider different applications including visual localization patch verification image matching and retrieval. The experiments show that our lightweight MLPs achieve better dimensionality reduction than PCA.

	<td><p>Fast item ranking is an important task in recommender systems. In previous works graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have demonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic searching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network measures). However since these ANN approaches must go through the neural measures several times during ranking the computation is not practical if the neural measure is a large network. On the other hand fast item ranking using existing hashing-based approaches such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions. Hashing approaches however are attractive because they provide a principle and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper we propose a simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking problem that can be used for any type of measure including neural network measures. Specifically we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g. users and items) into a common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme. Then we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and contrastive samples to train the hashing model. We empirically validate the proposed method against the existing state-of-the-art fast item ranking methods in several combinations of non-linear searching functions and prominent datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost performance is to employ generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However GAN-based methods are difficult to train which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation we propose a novel framework the generative cooperative hashing network which is based on energy-based cooperative learning. This framework jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function via two components a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives including probability density hash code latent code and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods achieving up to 10 relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is a principled approximate nearest neighbor approach to find similar items to a query in a large collection of images. Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stages continuous relaxation and the inference stages discrete quantization is important. However in the existing deep supervised hashing methods coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach substantially improves the performance of several representative hashing~methods.</p>

	<td><p>An intuitive way to search for images is to use queries composed of an example image and a complementary text. While the first provides rich and implicit context for the search the latter explicitly calls for new traits or specifies how some elements of the example image should be changed to retrieve the desired target image. Current approaches typically combine the features of each of the two elements of the query into a single representation which can then be compared to the ones of the potential target images. Our work aims at shedding new light on the task by looking at it through the prism of two familiar and related frameworks text-to-image and image-to-image retrieval. Taking inspiration from them we exploit the specific relation of each query element with the targeted image and derive light-weight attention mechanisms which enable to mediate between the two complementary modalities. We validate our approach on several retrieval benchmarks querying with images and their associated free-form text modifiers. Our method obtains state-of-the-art results without resorting to side information multi-level features heavy pre-training nor large architectures as in previous works.</p>

Many loss functions try to closer pairwise features from heterogeneous modalities. This paper proposes a method for learning joint embedding of images and texts using an intra-modal constraint loss function to reduce the violation of negative pairs from the same homogeneous modality.

	<td><p>Facial features are defined as the local relationships that exist amongst the pixels of a facial image. Hand-crafted descriptors identify the relationships of the pixels in the local neighbourhood defined by the kernel. Kernel is a two dimensional matrix which is moved across the facial image. Distinctive information captured by the kernel with limited number of pixel achieves satisfactory recognition and retrieval accuracies on facial images taken under constrained environment (controlled variations in light pose expressions and background). To achieve similar accuracies under unconstrained environment local neighbourhood has to be increased in order to encode more pixels. Increasing local neighbourhood also increases the feature length of the descriptor. In this paper we propose a hand-crafted descriptor namely Centre Symmetric Quadruple Pattern (CSQP) which is structurally symmetric and encodes the facial asymmetry in quadruple space. The proposed descriptor efficiently encodes larger neighbourhood with optimal number of binary bits. It has been shown using average entropy computed over feature images encoded with the proposed descriptor that the CSQP captures more meaningful information as compared to state of the art descriptors. The retrieval and recognition accuracies of the proposed descriptor has been compared with state of the art hand-crafted descriptors (CSLBP CSLTP LDP LBP SLBP and LDGP) on bench mark databases namely; LFW Colour-FERET and CASIA-face-v5. Result analysis shows that the proposed descriptor performs well under controlled as well as uncontrolled variations in pose illumination background and expressions.</p>

	<td><p>In tissue characterization and cancer diagnostics multimodal imaging has emerged as a powerful technique. Thanks to computational advances large datasets can be exploited to discover patterns in pathologies and improve diagnosis. However this requires efficient and scalable image retrieval methods. Cross-modality image retrieval is particularly challenging since images of similar (or even the same) content captured by different modalities might share few common structures. We propose a new application-independent content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system for reverse (sub-)image search across modalities which combines deep learning to generate representations (embedding the different modalities in a common space) with classical feature extraction and bag-of-words models for efficient and reliable retrieval. We illustrate its advantages through a replacement study exploring a number of feature extractors and learned representations as well as through comparison to recent (cross-modality) CBIR methods. For the task of (sub-)image retrieval on a (publicly available) dataset of brightfield and second harmonic generation microscopy images the results show that our approach is superior to all tested alternatives. We discuss the shortcomings of the compared methods and observe the importance of equivariance and invariance properties of the learned representations and feature extractors in the CBIR pipeline.

Yet these approaches only produce meaningful results if the nearest neighbors themselves are meaningful. For images represented in pixel space this is not the case as distances in pixel space are often not capturing our sense of similarity and therefore neighbors are not semantically close. This problem can be circumvented by self-supervised approaches based on contrastive learning such as SimCLR relying on data augmentation to generate implicit neighbors but these methods do not produce two-dimensional embeddings suitable for visualization. Here we present a new method called t-SimCNE for unsupervised visualization of image data. T-SimCNE combines ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings and trains a parametric mapping from the high-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D embeddings achieve classification accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art high-dimensional SimCLR representations thus faithfully capturing semantic relationships. Using t-SimCNE we obtain informative visualizations of the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets showing rich cluster structure and highlighting artifacts and outliers.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash pictures a list-wise sorting problem. Its testing metrics e.g. mean-average precision count on a sorted candidate list ordered by pair-wise code similarity. However scarcely does one train a deep hashing model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.</p>

A typical content-based image retrieval system deals with the query image and images in the dataset as a collection of low-level features and retrieves a ranked list of images based on the similarities between features of the query image and features of images in the image dataset. However top ranked images in the retrieved list which have high similarities to the query image may be different from the query image in terms of the semantic interpretation of the user which is known as the semantic gap. In order to reduce the semantic gap this paper investigates how natural scene retrieval can be performed using the bag of visual word model and the distribution of local semantic concepts. The paper studies the efficiency of using different approaches for representing the semantic information depicted in natural scene images for image retrieval. An extensive experimental work has been conducted to study the efficiency of using semantic information as well as the bag of visual words model for natural and urban scene image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised image retrieval aims to learn an efficient retrieval system without expensive data annotations but most existing methods rely heavily on handcrafted feature descriptors or pre-trained feature extractors. To minimize human supervision recent advance proposes deep fully unsupervised image retrieval aiming at training a deep model from scratch to jointly optimize visual features and quantization codes. However existing approach mainly focuses on instance contrastive learning without considering underlying semantic structure information resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work we propose a novel self-supervised consistent quantization approach to deep fully unsupervised image retrieval which consists of part consistent quantization and global consistent quantization. In part consistent quantization we devise part neighbor semantic consistency learning with codeword diversity regularization. This allows to discover underlying neighbor structure information of sub-quantized representations as self-supervision. In global consistent quantization we employ contrastive learning for both embedding and quantized representations and fuses these representations for consistent contrastive regularization between instances. This can make up for the loss of useful representation information during quantization and regularize consistency between instances. With a unified learning objective of part and global consistent quantization our approach exploits richer self-supervision cues to facilitate model learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we aim to design a provably robust image retrieval model which keeps the most important evaluation metric Recall@1 invariant to adversarial perturbation. We propose the first 1-nearest neighbor (NN) image retrieval algorithm RetrievalGuard which is provably robust against adversarial perturbations within an ell_2 ball of calculable radius. The challenge is to design a provably robust algorithm that takes into consideration the 1-NN search and the high-dimensional nature of the embedding space. Algorithmically given a base retrieval model and a query sample we build a smoothed retrieval model by carefully analyzing the 1-NN search procedure in the high-dimensional embedding space. We show that the smoothed retrieval model has bounded Lipschitz constant and thus the retrieval score is invariant to ell_2 adversarial perturbations. Experiments on image retrieval tasks validate the robustness of our RetrievalGuard method.</p>

	<td><p>Data similarity (or distance) computation is a fundamental research topic which fosters a variety of similarity-based machine learning and data mining applications. In big data analytics it is impractical to compute the exact similarity of data instances due to high computational cost. To this end the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique has been proposed to provide accurate estimators for various similarity measures between sets or vectors in an efficient manner without the learning process. Structured data (e.g. sequences trees and graphs) which are composed of elements and relations between the elements are commonly seen in the real world but the traditional LSH algorithms cannot preserve the structure information represented as relations between elements. In order to conquer the issue researchers have been devoted to the family of the hierarchical LSH algorithms. In this paper we explore the present progress of the research into hierarchical LSH from the following perspectives 1) Data structures where we review various hierarchical LSH algorithms for three typical data structures and uncover their inherent connections; 2) Applications where we review the hierarchical LSH algorithms in multiple application scenarios; 3) Challenges where we discuss some potential challenges as future directions.</p>

	<td><p>Hierarchical semantic structures naturally existing in real-world datasets can assist in capturing the latent distribution of data to learn robust hash codes for retrieval systems. Although hierarchical semantic structures can be simply expressed by integrating semantically relevant data into a high-level taxon with coarser-grained semantics the construction embedding and exploitation of the structures remain tricky for unsupervised hash learning. To tackle these problems we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper-sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition we extend the K-Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K-Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm including hierarchical instance-wise and hierarchical prototype-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods. Codes will be released.</p>

Numerous heuristic Hamming space metric learning objectives are designed to obtain high-quality hash codes. Nevertheless a theoretical analysis of criteria for learning good hash codes remains largely unexploited. In this paper we prove that inter-class distinctiveness and intra-class compactness among hash codes determine the lower bound of hash codes performance. Promoting these two characteristics could lift the bound and improve hash learning. We then propose a surrogate model to fully exploit the above objective by estimating the posterior of hash codes and controlling it which results in a low-bias optimization. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. By testing on a series of hash-models we obtain performance improvements among all of them with an up to 26.5 increase in mean Average Precision and an up to 20.5 increase in accuracy.

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing favored for its effectiveness and efficiency has received wide attention to facilitating efficient retrieval across different modalities. Nevertheless most existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the discriminative power of semantic information when learning the hash codes while often involving time-consuming training procedure for handling the large-scale dataset. To tackle these issues we formulate the learning of similarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic data so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming space and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH) approach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically FDDH introduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training examples to their corresponding semantic labels and utilizes -dragging technique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly the discriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and maximized. Moreover an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to map the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace which can well guarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic representation. Consequently an efficient closed form solution is derived for discriminative hash code learning which is very computationally efficient. In addition an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for optimizing modality-specific projection functions featuring adaptivity to different training sizes and streaming data. The proposed FDDH approach theoretically approximates the bi-Lipschitz continuity runs sufficiently fast and also significantly improves the retrieval performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

	<td><p>Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its computational and storage efficiency. Recently deep unsupervised hashing methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology. However most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning in which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is confronted with the following defects 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process which cannot explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the aforementioned problems we propose a Deep Self-Adaptive Hashing (DSAH) model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two special designs Adaptive Neighbor Discovery (AND) and Pairwise Information Content (PIC). Firstly we adopt the AND to initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix and then refine this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to them which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance.</p>

It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose an Attribute-Aware hashing Network (A-Net) for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. A-Net is also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to enhance their representation abilities. Finally, the required hash codes are generated by the attribute vectors driven by preserving original similarities. Qualitative experiments on five benchmark fine-grained datasets show our superiority over competing methods. More importantly, quantitative results demonstrate the obtained hash codes can strongly correspond to certain kinds of crucial properties of fine-grained objects.</p>

We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy, we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead, we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k, Nus-wide, Cifar-10, Mscoco, Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing (MinHash) is a classical method for efficiently estimating the Jaccrad similarity in massive binary (0/1) data. To generate K hash values for each data vector the standard theory of MinHash requires K independent permutations. Interestingly the recent work on circulant MinHash (C-MinHash) has shown that merely two permutations are needed. The first permutation breaks the structure of the data and the second permutation is re-used K time in a circulant manner. Surprisingly the estimation accuracy of C-MinHash is proved to be strictly smaller than that of the original MinHash. The more recent work further demonstrates that practically only one permutation is needed. Note that C-MinHash is different from the well-known work on One Permutation Hashing (OPH) published in NIPS12. OPH and its variants using different densification schemes are popular alternatives to the standard MinHash. The densification step is necessary in order to deal with empty bins which exist in One Permutation Hashing. In this paper we propose to incorporate the essential ideas of C-MinHash to improve the accuracy of One Permutation Hashing. Basically we develop a new densification method for OPH which achieves the smallest estimation variance compared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is named C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the existing structure of the data) C-OPH only needs a shorter permutation of length D/K (instead of D) where D is the original data dimension and K is the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in K bins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation variance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the existing (densified) OPH methods.</p>

However when the hash functions are updated the binary codes for the whole database have to be updated to be consistent with the hash functions resulting in the inefficiency in the online image retrieval process. In this paper we propose a novel online hashing framework without updating binary codes. In the proposed framework the hash functions are fixed and a parametric similarity function for the binary codes is learnt online to adapt to the streaming data. Specifically a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is adopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity function online based on the characteristics of the hashing methods. The experiments on two multi-label image datasets show that our method is competitive or outperforms the state-of-the-art online hashing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for multi-label image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>We consider a similarity measure between two sets A and B of vectors that balances the average and maximum cosine distance between pairs of vectors one from set A and one from set B. As a motivation for this measure we present lineage tracking in a database. To practically realize this measure we need an approximate search algorithm that given a set of vectors A and sets of vectors B_1â¦B_n the algorithm quickly locates the set B_i that maximizes the similarity measure. For the case where all sets are singleton sets essentially each is a single vector there are known efficient approximate search algorithms e.g. approximated versions of tree search algorithms locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) vector quantization (VQ) and proximity graph algorithms. In this work we present approximate search algorithms for the general case. The underlying idea in these algorithms is encoding a set of vectors via a long single vector. The proposed approximate approach achieves significant performance gains over an optimized exact search on vector sets.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has become a hot topic recently. Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However, current UCMH methods calculate the similarity between two data, mainly relying on the two dataâs cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space, because the cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the complex data relationships, such as situations where two data have different feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper, we devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN). Specifically, DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors. DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three types of data similarities (i.e., the graph-neighbor coherence, the coexistent similarity, and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization errors during hashing. Essentially, DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity problem by exploring and exploiting the dataâs intrinsic relationships in a graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN, e.g., by improving the mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit hashing codes to retrieval texts from images. We will release the source code package and the trained model on https://github.com/Atmegal/DGCPN.</p>

neural representations to low-dimensional binary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be accurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for 
Learning Low-dimensional binary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not require any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, 
and learns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The learnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal classification accuracy for 
ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the learnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by discovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further 
quantitatively measure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image retrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For ImageNet-100 
retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit HashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real representations. Finally, our learnt

To evaluate the proposed method we compile the new OLGA dataset which contains artist similarities from AllMusic together with content features from AcousticBrainz. With 17673 artists this is the largest academic artist similarity dataset that includes content-based features to date. Moreover we also showcase the scalability of our approach by experimenting with a much larger proprietary dataset. Results show the superiority of the proposed approach over current state-of-the-art methods for music similarity.

	<td><p>Traditional indexing techniques commonly employed in da-ta-ba-se systems perform poorly on multidimensional array scientific data. Bitmap indices are widely used in commercial databases for processing complex queries due to their effective use of bit-wise operations and space-efficiency. However bitmap indices apply natively to relational or linearized datasets which is especially notable in binned or compressed indices. We propose a new method for multidimensional array indexing that overcomes the dimensionality-induced inefficiencies. The hierarchical indexing method is based on n-di-men-sional sparse trees for dimension partitioning with bound number of individual adaptively binned indices for attribute partitioning. This indexing performs well on range involving both dimensions and attributes as it prunes the search space early avoids reading entire index data and does at most a single index traversal. Moreover the indexing is easily extensible to membership queries. The indexing method was implemented on top of a state of the art bitmap indexing library Fastbit. We show that the hierarchical bitmap index outperforms conventional bitmap indexing built on auxiliary attribute for each dimension. Furthermore the adaptive binning significantly reduces the amount of bins and therefore memory requirements.</p>

When using QE the search is conducted on a new query vector constructed using an aggregation function over the query and images from the database. Recent works gave rise to QE techniques in which the aggregation function is learned whereas previous techniques were based on hand-crafted aggregation functions e.g. taking the mean of the querys nearest neighbors. However most QE methods have focused on aggregation functions that work directly over the query and its immediate nearest neighbors. In this work a hierarchical model Graph Query Expansion (GQE) is presented which is learned in a supervised manner and performs aggregation over an extended neighborhood of the query thus increasing the information used from the database when computing the query expansion and using the structure of the nearest neighbors graph. The technique achieves state-of-the-art results over known benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Image Retrieval is a fundamental task of obtaining images similar to the query one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art image retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function e.g. (cdot) or (cdot) and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem Dead Bits Problem~(DBP). Besides the existing quantization loss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate DBP. Moreover we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further alleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the similarity between two images. The proposed gradient amplifier and error-aware quantization loss are compatible with a variety of deep hashing methods. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed gradient amplifier and the error-aware quantization loss.</p>

The basic idea of LSH is that similar items should produce hash collisions with higher probability than dissimilar items. We study LSH for (not necessarily convex) polygons and use it to give efficient data structures for similar shape retrieval. Arkin et al. represent polygons by their turning function - a function which follows the angle between the polygons tangent and the x -axis while traversing the perimeter of the polygon. They define the distance between polygons to be variations of the L_p (for p=12) distance between their turning functions. This metric is invariant under translation rotation and scaling (and the selection of the initial point on the perimeter) and therefore models well the intuitive notion of shape resemblance. We develop and analyze LSH near neighbor data structures for several variations of the L_p distance for functions (for p=12). By applying our schemes to the turning functions of a collection of polygons we obtain efficient near neighbor LSH-based structures for polygons. To tune our structures to turning functions of polygons we prove some new properties of these turning functions that may be of independent interest. As part of our analysis we address the following problem which is of independent interest. Find the vertical translation of a function f that is closest in L_1 distance to a function g . We prove tight bounds on the approximation guarantee obtained by the translation which is equal to the difference between the averages of g and f .</p>

	<td><p>In recent years, supervised hashing has been validated to greatly boost the performance of image retrieval. However, the label-hungry property requires massive label collection, making it intractable in practical scenarios. To liberate the model training procedure from laborious manual annotations, some unsupervised methods are proposed. However, the following two factors make unsupervised algorithms inferior to their supervised counterparts: (1) Without manually-defined labels, it is difficult to capture the semantic information across data, which is of crucial importance to guide robust binary code learning. (2) The widely adopted relaxation on binary constraints results in quantization error accumulation in the optimization procedure. To address the above-mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Discrete Hashing method (UDH). Specifically, to capture the semantic information, we propose a balanced graph-based semantic loss which explores the affinity priors in the original feature space. Then, we propose a novel self-supervised loss, termed orthogonal consistent loss, which can leverage semantic loss of instance and impose independence of codes. Moreover, by integrating the discrete optimization into the proposed unsupervised framework, the binary constraints are consistently preserved, alleviating the influence of quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>In hash-based image retrieval systems degraded or transformed inputs usually generate different codes from the original deteriorating the retrieval accuracy. To mitigate this issue data augmentation can be applied during training. However even if augmented samples of an image are similar in real feature space the quantization can scatter them far away in Hamming space. This results in representation discrepancies that can impede training and degrade performance. In this work we propose a novel self-distilled hashing scheme to minimize the discrepancy while exploiting the potential of augmented data. By transferring the hash knowledge of the weakly-transformed samples to the strong ones we make the hash code insensitive to various transformations. We also introduce hash proxy-based similarity learning and binary cross entropy-based quantization loss to provide fine quality hash codes. Ultimately we construct a deep hashing framework that not only improves the existing deep hashing approaches but also achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted and confirm the effectiveness of our work.</p>

	<td><p>Face image retrieval which searches for images of the same identity from the query input face image is drawing more attention as the size of the image database increases rapidly. In order to conduct fast and accurate retrieval a compact hash code-based methods have been proposed and recently deep face image hashing methods with supervised classification training have shown outstanding performance. However classification-based scheme has a disadvantage in that it cannot reveal complex similarities between face images into the hash code learning. In this paper we attempt to improve the face image retrieval quality by proposing a Similarity Guided Hashing (SGH) method which gently considers self and pairwise-similarity simultaneously. SGH employs various data augmentations designed to explore elaborate similarities between face images solving both intra and inter identity-wise difficulties. Extensive experimental results on the protocols with existing benchmarks and an additionally proposed large scale higher resolution face image dataset demonstrate that our SGH delivers state-of-the-art retrieval performance.</p>

	<td><p>The practical value of existing supervised sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) algorithms is largely limited by the requirement for intensive data collection and labeling. In this paper we present the first attempt at unsupervised SBIR to remove the labeling cost (both category annotations and sketch-photo pairings) that is conventionally needed for training. Existing single-domain unsupervised representation learning methods perform poorly in this application due to the unique cross-domain (sketch and photo) nature of the problem. We therefore introduce a novel framework that simultaneously performs sketch-photo domain alignment and semantic-aware representation learning. Technically this is underpinned by introducing joint distribution optimal transport (JDOT) to align data from different domains which we extend with trainable cluster prototypes and feature memory banks to further improve scalability and efficacy. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves excellent performance in the new unsupervised setting and performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art in the zero-shot setting.</p>

	<td><p>Networks are ubiquitous in the real world. Link prediction as one of the key problems for network-structured data aims to predict whether there exists a link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the intensive similarity computation in link prediction the hashing technique has been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space. However the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash techniques in the embedding process. Currently the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory costs due to massive parameter learning which makes the GNN-based algorithms impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper we propose a simple and effective model called GNN which balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. GNN is able to efficiently acquire node representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore we characterize the discriminative power of GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm while running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability on a large-scale network with the limited resources.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we adopt the maximizing mutual information (MI) approach to tackle the problem of unsupervised learning of binary hash codes for efficient cross-modal retrieval. We proposed a novel method dubbed Cross-Modal Info-Max Hashing (CMIMH). First to learn informative representations that can preserve both intra- and inter-modal similarities we leverage the recent advances in estimating variational lower-bound of MI to maximize the MI between the binary representations and input features and between binary representations of different modalities. By jointly maximizing these MIs under the assumption that the binary representations are modelled by multivariate Bernoulli distributions we can learn binary representations which can preserve both intra- and inter-modal similarities effectively in a mini-batch manner with gradient descent. Furthermore we find out that trying to minimize the modality gap by learning similar binary representations for the same instance from different modalities could result in less informative representations. Hence balancing between reducing the modality gap and losing modality-private information is important for the cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quantitative evaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.</p>

	<td><p>Semantic hashing represents documents as compact binary vectors (hash codes) and allows both efficient and effective similarity search in large-scale information retrieval. The state of the art has primarily focused on learning hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness while assuming a brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes even though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index hashing an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH) an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing while being end-to-end trainable. In fact our proposed training objectives are model agnostic i.e. not tied to how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH and are straight-forward to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan they are still upwards of 33 slower than MISH while MISH is still able to obtain state-of-the-art effectiveness.</p>

	<td><p>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors denoted which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes compared to real-valued representations a core open challenge is how to generate hash codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small number of bits while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use representation learning for generating such hash codes focusing on neural autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than the current state of the art namely the Hamming distance and (ii) improve efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.</p>

	<td><p>When reasoning about tasks that involve large amounts of data a common approach is to represent data items as objects in the Hamming space where operations can be done efficiently and effectively. Object similarity can then be computed by learning binary representations (hash codes) of the objects and computing their Hamming distance. While this is highly efficient each bit dimension is equally weighted which means that potentially discriminative information of the data is lost. A more expressive alternative is to use real-valued vector representations and compute their inner product; this allows varying the weight of each dimension but is many magnitudes slower. To fix this we derive a new way of measuring the dissimilarity between two objects in the Hamming space with binary weighting of each dimension (i.e. disabling bits) we consider a field-agnostic dissimilarity that projects the vector of one object onto the vector of the other. When working in the Hamming space this results in a novel projected Hamming dissimilarity which by choice of projection effectively allows a binary importance weighting of the hash code of one object through the hash code of the other. We propose a variational hashing model for learning hash codes optimized for this projected Hamming dissimilarity and experimentally evaluate it in collaborative filtering experiments. The resultant hash codes lead to effectiveness gains of up to +7 in NDCG and +14 in MRR compared to state-of-the-art hashing-based collaborative filtering baselines while requiring no additional storage and no computational overhead compared to using the Hamming distance.</p>

Thereinto hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has drawn lots of attention in recent years there still remain some problems. The first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this paper we propose a new model termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS). We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data which could help handle the new coming classes and thereby construct the enhanced semantic objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our method can exceed the state-of-the-art models.

	<td><p>Canonical Huffman code is an optimal prefix-free compression code whose codewords enumerated in the lexicographical order form a list of binary words in non-decreasing lengths. Gagie et al.

It uses sigma lg ell_ + o(sigma) + O(ell_^2) bits of space where sigma and ell_ are the alphabet size and maximum codeword length respectively. We refine their representation to reduce the space complexity to sigma lg ell_ (1 + o(1)) bits while preserving the constant encode and decode times.

	<td><p>In light of the ability to enable efficient storage and fast query for big data, hashing techniques for cross-modal search have aroused extensive attention. Despite the great success achieved, unsupervised cross-modal hashing still suffers from lacking reliable similarity supervision and struggles with handling the heterogeneity issue between different modalities. To cope with these, in this paper, we devise a new deep hashing model, termed as High-order Nonlocal Hashing (HNH) to facilitate cross-modal retrieval with the following advantages. First, different from existing methods that mainly leverage low-level local-view similarity as the guidance for hashing learning, we propose a high-order affinity measure that considers the multi-modal neighbourhood structures from a nonlocal perspective, thereby comprehensively capturing the similarity relationships between data items. Second, a common representation is introduced to correlate different modalities. By enforcing the modal-specific descriptors and the common representation to be aligned with each other, the proposed HNH significantly bridges the modality gap and maintains the intra-consistency. Third, an effective affinity preserving objective function is delicately designed to generate high-quality binary codes. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of the proposed HNH in unsupervised cross-modal retrieval tasks over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

To this end we propose the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA). It injects a small number of poisoned images with the correct label into the training data which makes the attack hard to be detected. To craft the poisoned images we first propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code learning. As such the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by optimizing the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space. We then employ the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger to improve the attack performance. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CIBA.

	<td><p>When encountering a dubious diagnostic case medical instance retrieval can help radiologists make evidence-based diagnoses by finding images containing instances similar to a query case from a large image database. The similarity between the query case and retrieved similar cases is determined by visual features extracted from pathologically abnormal regions. However the manifestation of these regions often lacks specificity i.e. different diseases can have the same manifestation and different manifestations may occur at different stages of the same disease. To combat the manifestation ambiguity in medical instance retrieval we propose a novel deep framework called Y-Net encoding images into compact hash-codes generated from convolutional features by feature aggregation. Y-Net can learn highly discriminative convolutional features by unifying the pixel-wise segmentation loss and classification loss. The segmentation loss allows exploring subtle spatial differences for good spatial-discriminability while the classification loss utilizes class-aware semantic information for good semantic-separability. As a result Y-Net can enhance the visual features in pathologically abnormal regions and suppress the disturbing of the background during model training which could effectively embed discriminative features into the hash-codes in the retrieval stage. Extensive experiments on two medical image datasets demonstrate that Y-Net can alleviate the ambiguity of pathologically abnormal regions and its retrieval performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 9.27 on the returned list of 10.</p>

However existing deep hashing methods have a poor small-sample ranking performance for case-based medical image retrieval. The top-ranked images in the returned query results may be as a different class than the query image. This ranking problem is caused by classification regions of interest (ROI) and small-sample information loss in the hashing space. To address the ranking problem we propose an end-to-end framework called Attention-based Triplet Hashing (ATH) network to learn low-dimensional hash codes that preserve the classification ROI and small-sample information. We embed a spatial-attention module into the network structure of our ATH to focus on ROI information. The spatial-attention module aggregates the spatial information of feature maps by utilizing max-pooling element-wise maximum and element-wise mean operations jointly along the channel axis. The triplet cross-entropy loss can help to map the classification information of images and similarity between images into the hash codes. Extensive experiments on two case-based medical datasets demonstrate that our proposed ATH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods and boost the ranking performance for small samples. Compared to the other loss methods the triplet cross-entropy loss can enhance the classification performance and hash code-discriminability</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has shown promising performance in large-scale image retrieval. However latent codes extracted by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) will inevitably lose semantic information during the binarization process which damages the retrieval accuracy and makes it challenging. Although many existing approaches perform regularization to alleviate quantization errors we figure out an incompatible conflict between metric learning and quantization learning. The metric loss penalizes the inter-class distances to push different classes unconstrained far away. Worse still it tends to map the latent code deviate from ideal binarization point and generate severe ambiguity in the binarization process. Based on the minimum distance of the binary linear code we creatively propose Hashing-guided Hinge Function (HHF) to avoid such conflict. In detail the carefully-designed inflection point which relies on the hash bit length and category numbers is explicitly adopted to balance the metric term and quantization term. Such a modification prevents the network from falling into local metric optimal minima in deep hashing. Extensive experiments in CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 ImageNet and MS-COCO show that HHF consistently outperforms existing techniques and is robust and flexible to transplant into other methods.

Compared to existing GPU hash map implementations ASH achieves higher performance supports richer functionality and requires fewer lines of code (LoC) when used for implementing spatially varying operations from volumetric geometry reconstruction to differentiable appearance reconstruction. Unlike existing GPU hash maps the ASH framework provides a versatile tensor interface hiding low-level details from the users. In addition by decoupling the internal hashing data structures and key-value data in buffers we offer direct access to spatially varying data via indices enabling seamless integration to modern libraries such as PyTorch. To achieve this we 1) detach stored key-value data from the low-level hash map implementation; 2) bridge the pointer-first low level data structures to index-first high-level tensor interfaces via an index heap; 3) adapt both generic and non-generic integer-only hash map implementations as backends to operate on multi-dimensional keys. We first profile our hash map against state-of-the-art hash maps on synthetic data to show the performance gain from this architecture. We then show that ASH can consistently achieve higher performance on various large-scale 3D perception tasks with fewer LoC by showcasing several applications including 1) point cloud voxelization 2) retargetable volumetric scene reconstruction 3) non-rigid point cloud registration and volumetric deformation and 4) spatially varying geometry and appearance refinement.

	<td><p>Spatial-temporal local binary pattern (STLBP) has been widely used in dynamic texture recognition. STLBP often encounters the high-dimension problem as its dimension increases exponentially so that STLBP could only utilize a small neighborhood. To tackle this problem we propose a method for dynamic texture recognition using PDV hashing and dictionary learning on multi-scale volume local binary pattern (PHD-MVLBP). Instead of forming very high-dimensional LBP histogram features it first uses hash functions to map the pixel difference vectors (PDVs) to binary vectors then forms a dictionary using the derived binary vector and encodes them using the derived dictionary. In such a way the PDVs are mapped to feature vectors of the size of dictionary instead of LBP histograms of very high dimension. Such an encoding scheme could extract the discriminant information from videos in a much larger neighborhood effectively. The experimental results on two widely-used dynamic textures datasets DynTex++ and UCLA show the superiority performance of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the quick development of social websites, there are more opportunities to have different media types (such as text, image, video, etc.) describing the same topic from large-scale heterogeneous data sources. To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval, unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However, most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result, existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article, we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function, exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence, and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem, and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki, MIRFlickr, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO). The results demonstrate that RUCMH can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, especially for the partially paired case, which validates the effectiveness of RUCMH.</p>

Until now the deep hashing for the image retrieval community has been dominated by convolutional neural network architectures e.g. . In this paper inspired by the recent advancements of vision transformers we present a pure transformer-based framework for deep hashing learning. Concretely our framework is composed of two major modules (1) Based on (ViT) we design a siamese vision transformer backbone for image feature extraction. To learn fine-grained features we innovate a dual-stream feature learning on top of the transformer to learn discriminative global and local features. (2) Besides we adopt a Bayesian learning scheme with a dynamically constructed similarity matrix to learn compact binary hash codes. The entire framework is jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.~To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to tackle deep hashing learning problems without convolutional neural networks (). We perform comprehensive experiments on three widely-studied datasets and . The experiments have evidenced our superiority against the existing state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. Specifically we achieve 8.2 2.6 12.7 performance gains in terms of average for different hash bit lengths on three public datasets respectively.</p>

However existing visual content based methods cannot fully exploit the user and tourist attraction information of photos to extract visual features and do not differentiate the significances of different photos. In this paper we propose multi-level visual similarity based personalized tourist attraction recommendation using geo-tagged photos (MEAL). MEAL utilizes the visual contents of photos and interaction behavior data to obtain the final embeddings of users and tourist attractions which are then used to predict the visit probabilities. Specifically by crossing the user and tourist attraction information of photos we define four visual similarity levels and introduce a corresponding quintuplet loss to embed the visual contents of photos. In addition to capture the significances of different photos we exploit the self-attention mechanism to obtain the visual representations of users and tourist attractions. We conducted experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr and the experimental results proved the advantage of this method.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing, which represents data items as compact binary codes, has
been becoming a more and more popular technique, e.g., for large-scale image retrieval, owing to its super fast search speed as well
as its extremely economical memory consumption. However, existing hashing methods all try to learn binary codes from artificially
balanced datasets which are not commonly available in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Long-Tail Hashing Network
(LTHNet), a novel two-stage deep hashing approach that addresses
the problem of learning to hash for more realistic datasets where
the data labels roughly exhibit a long-tail distribution. Specifically,
the first stage is to learn relaxed embeddings of the given dataset
with its long-tail characteristic taken into account via an end-to-end deep neural network; the second stage is to binarize those
obtained embeddings. A critical part of LTHNet is its extended dynamic meta-embedding module which can adaptively realize visual
knowledge transfer between head and tail classes, and thus enrich
image representations for hashing. Our experiments have shown
that LTHNet achieves dramatic performance improvements over all
state-of-the-art competitors on long-tail datasets, with no or little
sacrifice on balanced datasets. Further analyses reveal that while to
our surprise directly manipulating class weights in the loss function
has little effect, the extended dynamic meta-embedding module, the
usage of cross-entropy loss instead of square loss, and the relatively
small batch-size for training all contribute to LTHNetâs success.</p>

However the efficiency of most existing DR models is limited by the large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest neighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore we present RepCONC a novel retrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained Clustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization (PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast approximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained clustering process which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly clustered around the quantization centroids and supports end-to-end optimization of the quantization method and dual-encoders. We theoretically demonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint in RepCONC and derive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing it to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Besides constrained clustering RepCONC further adopts a vector-based inverted file system (IVF) to support highly efficient vector search on CPUs. Extensive experiments on two popular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC achieves better ranking effectiveness than competitive vector quantization baselines under different compression ratio settings. It also substantially outperforms a wide range of existing retrieval models in terms of retrieval effectiveness memory efficiency and time efficiency.</p>

Most existing deep supervised hashing works which are based on pairwise/triplet labels suffer from the expensive computational cost and insufficient utilization of the semantics information. Recently deep classwise hashing introduced a classwise loss supervised by class labels information alternatively; however we find it still has its drawback. In this paper we propose an improved deep classwise hashing which enables hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. Specifically we design a two-step strategy on center similarity learning. It interacts with the classwise loss to attract the class center to concentrate on the intra-class samples while pushing other class centers as far as possible. The centers similarity learning contributes to generating more compact and discriminative hashing codes. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets.

	<td><p>Despite being one of the oldest data structures in computer science hash tables continue to be the focus of a great deal of both theoretical and empirical research. A central reason for this is that many of the fundamental properties that one desires from a hash table are difficult to achieve simultaneously; thus many variants offering different trade-offs have been proposed. This paper introduces Iceberg hashing a hash table that simultaneously offers the strongest known guarantees on a large number of core properties. Iceberg hashing supports constant-time operations while improving on the state of the art for space efficiency cache efficiency and low failure probability. Iceberg hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to 1 - o(1) while being stable meaning that the position where an element is stored only ever changes when resizes occur. In fact in the setting where keys are Theta(log n) bits the space guarantees that Iceberg hashing offers namely that it uses at most log n + O(n log log n) bits to store n items from a universe U matches a lower bound by Demaine et al. that applies to any stable hash table. Iceberg hashing introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the most basic aspects of hash-table design. Notably our indirection-free technique for dynamic resizing which we call waterfall addressing and our techniques for achieving stability and very-high probability guarantees can be applied to any hash table that makes use of the front-yard/backyard paradigm for hash table design.</p>

	<td><p>For nearly six decades the central open question in the study of hash tables has been to determine the optimal achievable tradeoff curve between time and space. State-of-the-art hash tables offer the following guarantee If keys/values are Theta(log n) bits each then it is possible to achieve constant-time insertions/deletions/queries while wasting only O(loglog n) bits of space per key when compared to the information-theoretic optimum. Even prior to this bound being achieved the target of O(loglog n) wasted bits per key was known to be a natural end goal and was proven to be optimal for a number of closely related problems (e.g. stable hashing dynamic retrieval and dynamically-resized filters). This paper shows that O(loglog n) wasted bits per key is not the end of the line for hashing. In fact for any k in log n it is possible to achieve O(k)-time insertions/deletions O(1)-time queries and O(log^(k) n) wasted bits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that each time we increase insertion/deletion time by an we reduce the wasted bits per key . We further show that this tradeoff curve is the best achievable by any of a large class of hash tables including any hash table designed using the current framework for making constant-time hash tables succinct.</p>

	<td><p>This paper studies the cardinality of codes correcting insertions and deletions. We give improved upper and lower bounds on code size. Our upper bound is obtained by utilizing the asymmetric property of list decoding for insertions and deletions and can be seen as analogous to the Elias bound in the Hamming metric. Our non-asymptotic bound is better than the existing bounds when the minimum Levenshtein distance is relatively large. The asymptotic bound exceeds the Elias and the MRRW bounds adapted from the Hamming-metric bounds for the binary and the quaternary cases. Our lower bound improves on the bound by Levenshtein but its effect is limited and vanishes asymptotically.</p>

In practice many heuristic approaches exist to learn the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS crucially adapting to the structure of the given dataset. Oftentimes these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real datasets but almost always come at the cost of losing the guarantees of either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries or apply to datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper we design an NNS algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially matching that of theoretical algorithms while optimizing the hashing to the structure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on the minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithms ability to optimize for a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical side we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much better than the standard theoretical one. On the practical side we run experiments that show that our algorithm has a 1.8x and 2.1x better recall on the worst-performing queries to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets.</p>

This study proposes a content-based similarity measure for high-resolution gigapixel histopathology images. The proposed similarity measure is an expansion of cosine vector similarity to a matrix. Each image is divided into same-size patches with a meaningful amount of information (i.e. contained enough tissue). The similarity is measured by the extraction of patch-level deep embeddings of the last pooling layer of a pre-trained deep model at four different magnification levels namely 1x 2.5x 5x and 10x magnifications. In addition for faster measurement embedding reduction is investigated. Finally to assess the proposed method an image search method is implemented. Results show that the similarity measure represents the slide labels with a maximum accuracy of 93.18 for top-5 search at 5x magnification.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing approaches including deep quantization and deep binary hashing have become a common solution to large-scale image retrieval due to their high computation and storage efficiency. Most existing hashing methods cannot produce satisfactory results for fine-grained retrieval because they usually adopt the outputs of the last CNN layer to generate binary codes. Since deeper layers tend to summarize visual clues e.g. texture into abstract semantics e.g. dogs and cats the feature produced by the last CNN layer is less effective in capturing subtle but discriminative visual details that mostly exist in shallow layers. To improve fine-grained image hashing we propose Pyramid Hybrid Pooling Quantization (PHPQ). Specifically we propose a Pyramid Hybrid Pooling (PHP) module to capture and preserve fine-grained semantic information from multi-level features which emphasizes the subtle discrimination of different sub-categories. Besides we propose a learnable quantization module with a partial codebook attention mechanism which helps to optimize the most relevant codewords and improves the quantization. Comprehensive experiments on two widely-used public benchmarks i.e. CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs demonstrate that PHPQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Nowadays deep learning models are widely adopted in web-scale applications such as recommender systems and online advertising. In these applications embedding learning of categorical features is crucial to the success of deep learning models. In these models a standard method is that each categorical feature value is assigned a unique embedding vector which can be learned and optimized. Although this method can well capture the characteristics of the categorical features and promise good performance it can incur a huge memory cost to store the embedding table especially for those web-scale applications. Such a huge memory cost significantly holds back the effectiveness and usability of EDRMs. In this paper we propose a binary code based hash embedding method which allows the size of the embedding table to be reduced in arbitrary scale without compromising too much performance. Experimental evaluation results show that one can still achieve 99 performance even if the embedding table size is reduced 1000times smaller than the original one with our proposed method.</p>

However some applications use images from various other domains and therefore need a network with good generalization properties - a general-purpose CBIR model. To the best of our knowledge no testing protocol has so far been introduced to benchmark models with respect to general image retrieval quality. After analyzing popular image retrieval test sets we decided to manually curate GPR1200 an easy to use and accessible but challenging benchmark dataset with a broad range of image categories. This benchmark is subsequently used to evaluate various pretrained models of different architectures on their generalization qualities.

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by encoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient retrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning central similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data distribution. For multi-label image retrieval however previous methods only use multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the learning target which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash centers and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the above issue we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach Instance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS) to automatically learn the center weight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly we apply the maximum entropy regularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function and compute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly we update neural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center weights. More importantly the learned center weights can well reflect the proportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks and especially improves the mAP by 1.6-6.4 on the MS COCO dataset.</p>

	<td><p>Many unsupervised hashing methods are implicitly established on the idea of reconstructing the input data which basically encourages the hashing codes to retain as much information of original data as possible. However this requirement may force the models spending lots of their effort on reconstructing the unuseful background information while ignoring to preserve the discriminative semantic information that is more important for the hashing task. To tackle this problem inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in learning continuous representations we propose to adapt this framework to learn binary hashing codes. Specifically we first propose to modify the objective function to meet the specific requirement of hashing and then introduce a probabilistic binary representation layer into the model to facilitate end-to-end training of the entire model. We further prove the strong connection between the proposed contrastive-learning-based hashing method and the mutual information and show that the proposed model can be considered under the broader framework of the information bottleneck (IB). Under this perspective a more general hashing model is naturally obtained. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>A function f U to 0ldotsn-1 is a minimal perfect hash function for a set S subseteq U of size n if f bijectively maps S into the first n natural numbers. These functions are important for many practical applications in computing such as search engines computer networks and databases. Several algorithms have been proposed to build minimal perfect hash functions that scale well to large sets retain fast evaluation time and take very little space e.g. 2 - 3 bits/key. PTHash is one such algorithm achieving very fast evaluation in compressed space typically several times faster than other techniques. In this work we propose a new construction algorithm for PTHash enabling (1) multi-threading to either build functions more quickly or more space-efficiently and (2) external-memory processing to scale to inputs much larger than the available internal memory. Only few other algorithms in the literature share these features despite of their big practical impact. We conduct an extensive experimental assessment on large real-world string collections and show that with respect to other techniques PTHash is competitive in construction time and space consumption but retains 2 - 6times better lookup time.</p>

	<td><p>Given a set S of n distinct keys a function f that bijectively maps the keys of S into the range 0ldotsn-1 is called a minimal perfect hash function for S. Algorithms that find such functions when n is large and retain constant evaluation time are of practical interest; for instance search engines and databases typically use minimal perfect hash functions to quickly assign identifiers to static sets of variable-length keys such as strings. The challenge is to design an algorithm which is efficient in three different aspects time to find f (construction time) time to evaluate f on a key of S (lookup time) and space of representation for f. Several algorithms have been proposed to trade-off between these aspects. In 1992 Fox Chen and Heath (FCH) presented an algorithm at SIGIR providing very fast lookup evaluation. However the approach received little attention because of its large construction time and higher space consumption compared to other subsequent techniques. Almost thirty years later we revisit their framework and present an improved algorithm that scales well to large sets and reduces space consumption altogether without compromising the lookup time. We conduct an extensive experimental assessment and show that the algorithm finds functions that are competitive in space with state-of-the art techniques and provide 2-4times better lookup time.</p>

	<td><p>In content-based image retrieval the first-round retrieval result by simple visual feature comparison may be unsatisfactory which can be refined by visual re-ranking techniques. In image retrieval it is observed that the contextual similarity among the top-ranked images is an important clue to distinguish the semantic relevance. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a visual re-ranking method by contextual similarity aggregation with self-attention. In our approach for each image in the top-K ranking list we represent it into an affinity feature vector by comparing it with a set of anchor images. Then the affinity features of the top-K images are refined by aggregating the contextual information with a transformer encoder. Finally the affinity features are used to recalculate the similarity scores between the query and the top-K images for re-ranking of the latter. To further improve the robustness of our re-ranking model and enhance the performance of our method a new data augmentation scheme is designed. Since our re-ranking model is not directly involved with the visual feature used in the initial retrieval it is ready to be applied to retrieval result lists obtained from various retrieval algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed visual re-ranking method.</p>

	<td><p>With the need of fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint document hashing has been playing a crucial role in large-scale information retrieval. To generate high-quality hashing code both semantics and neighborhood information are crucial. However most existing methods leverage only one of them or simply combine them via some intuitive criteria lacking a theoretical principle to guide the integration process. In this paper we encode the neighborhood information with a graph-induced Gaussian distribution and propose to integrate the two types of information with a graph-driven generative model. To deal with the complicated correlations among documents we further propose a tree-structured approximation method for learning. Under the approximation we prove that the training objective can be decomposed into terms involving only singleton or pairwise documents enabling the model to be trained as efficiently as uncorrelated ones. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model for simultaneously preserving semantic and neighborhood information.</p>

	<td><p>Existing unsupervised document hashing methods are mostly established on generative models. Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency structures these methods rarely model the raw documents directly but instead to model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW) TFIDF). In this paper we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing their tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try we modify existing generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However little improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF features. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative hashing which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT embeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue a new unsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual information (MI) maximization principle. Specifically the method first constructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks to maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes that outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial margin.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years cross-media hashing technique has attracted increasing attention for its high computation efficiency and low storage cost. However the existing approaches still have some limitations which need to be explored. 1) A fixed hash length (e.g. 16bits or 32bits) is predefined before learning the binary codes. Therefore these models need to be retrained when the hash length changes that consumes additional computation power reducing the scalability in practical applications. 2) Existing cross-modal approaches only explore the information in the original multimedia data to perform the hash learning without exploiting the semantic information contained in the learned hash codes. To this end we develop a novel Multiple hash cOdes jOint learNing method (MOON) for cross-media retrieval. Specifically the developed MOON synchronously learns the hash codes with multiple lengths in a unified framework. Besides to enhance the underlying discrimination we combine the clues from the multimodal data semantic labels and learned hash codes for hash learning. As far as we know the proposed MOON is the first work to simultaneously learn different length hash codes without retraining in cross-media retrieval. Experiments on several databases show that our MOON can achieve promising performance outperforming some recent competitive shallow and deep methods.</p>

Yet the hash is invariant to benign transformations (changes in quality codecs sizes shapes etc.) experienced by images during online redistribution. Our key contribution is OSCAR-Net (Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution Network); a robust image hashing model inspired by recent successes of Transformers in the visual domain.

An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and re-ranking. Finally we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art.

First low dimensional feature embedding can fasten the retrieval process but bring accuracy reduce due to overlooking the feature of significant attention regions of images in fine-grained datasets. Second fine-grained images lead to the same category query hash codes mapping into the different cluster in database hash latent space. To handle these two issues we propose a feature consistency driven attention erasing network (FCAENet) for fine-grained image retrieval. For the first issue we propose an adaptive augmentation module in FCAENet which is selective region erasing module (SREM). SREM makes the network more robust on subtle differences of fine-grained task by adaptively covering some regions of raw images. The feature extractor and hash layer can learn more representative hash code for fine-grained images by SREM. With regard to the second issue we fully exploit the pair-wise similarity information and add the enhancing space relation loss (ESRL) in FCAENet to make the vulnerable relation stabler between the query hash code and database hash code. We conduct extensive experiments on five fine-grained benchmark datasets (CUB2011 Aircraft NABirds VegFru Food101) for 12bits 24bits 32bits 48bits hash code.

Two families of approaches have emerged depending on whether documents and queries are represented by single or multiple embeddings. ColBERT the exemplar of the latter uses an ANN index and approximate scores to identify a set of candidate documents for each query embedding which are then re-ranked using accurate document representations. In this manner a large number of documents can be retrieved for each query hindering the efficiency of the approach. In this work we investigate the use of ANN scores for ranking the candidate documents in order to decrease the number of candidate documents being fully scored. Experiments conducted on the MSMARCO passage ranking corpus demonstrate that by cutting of the candidate set by using the approximate scores to only 200 documents we can still obtain an effective ranking without statistically significant differences in effectiveness and resulting in a 2x speedup in efficiency.</p>

	<td><p>As hashing becomes an increasingly appealing technique for large-scale image retrieval multi-label hashing is also attracting more attention for the ability to exploit multi-level semantic contents. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method for scalable multi-label image search. Unlike existing approaches with conventional objectives such as contrast and triplet losses we employ a rank list rather than pairs or triplets to provide sufficient global supervision information for all the samples. Specifically a new rank-consistency objective is applied to align the similarity orders from two spaces the original space and the hamming space. A powerful loss function is designed to penalize the samples whose semantic similarity and hamming distance are mismatched in two spaces. Besides a multi-label softmax cross-entropy loss is presented to enhance the discriminative power with a concise formulation of the derivative function. In order to manipulate the neighborhood structure of the samples with different labels we design a multi-label clustering loss to cluster the hashing vectors of the samples with the same labels by reducing the distances between the samples and their multiple corresponding class centers. The state-of-the-art experimental results achieved on three public multi-label datasets MIRFLICKR-25K IAPRTC12 and NUS-WIDE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Entity retrieval which aims at disambiguating mentions to canonical entities from massive KBs is essential for many tasks in natural language processing. Recent progress in entity retrieval shows that the dual-encoder structure is a powerful and efficient framework to nominate candidates if entities are only identified by descriptions. However they ignore the property that meanings of entity mentions diverge in different contexts and are related to various portions of descriptions which are treated equally in previous works. In this work we propose Multi-View Entity Representations (MuVER) a novel approach for entity retrieval that constructs multi-view representations for entity descriptions and approximates the optimal view for mentions via a heuristic searching method. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on ZESHEL and improves the quality of candidates on three standard Entity Linking datasets</p>

Deep supervised hashing methods are not widely used because of the lack of labeled data especially when the domain is transferred. Meanwhile unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of reliable similarity signals. To tackle this problem we propose a novel deep unsupervised hashing method namely Distilled Smooth Guidance (DSG) which can learn a distilled dataset consisting of similarity signals as well as smooth confidence signals. To be specific we obtain the similarity confidence weights based on the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and construct a priority loss function for smooth similarity-preserving learning. Besides global information based on clustering is utilized to distill the image pairs by removing contradictory similarity signals. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed DSG consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art search methods.</p>

Different from classification-centric supervision traditionally available for learning image representations we address the task of learning from relative similarity labels in a ranking context. Rooted within the contrastive learning paradigm we propose a novel loss function that operates on pairs of similar and dissimilar images and imposes relative ordering between them in embedding space. We demonstrate that this Ranking loss coupled with an intuitive triple sampling strategy leads to robust representations that outperform well-known contrastive losses on the retrieval task. In addition we provide qualitative evidence of how retrieved results that utilize structured scene information capture the global context of the scene different from visual similarity search.</p>

This paper focuses on non-parametric and data-independent learning from set-structured data using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) solutions particularly locality-sensitive hashing. We consider the problem of set retrieval from an input set query. Such retrieval problem requires 1) an efficient mechanism to calculate the distances/dissimilarities between sets and 2) an appropriate data structure for fast nearest neighbor search. To that end we propose Sliced-Wasserstein set embedding as a computationally efficient set-2-vector mechanism that enables downstream ANN with theoretical guarantees. The set elements are treated as samples from an unknown underlying distribution and the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is used to compare sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm denoted as Set-LOcality Sensitive Hashing (SLOSH) on various set retrieval datasets and compare our proposed embedding with standard set embedding approaches including Generalized Mean (GeM) embedding/pooling Featurewise Sort Pooling (FSPool) and Covariance Pooling and show consistent improvement in retrieval results.

	<td><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly refers to identifying anomalous events that have not occurred in the training set where only normal samples are available. Existing works usually formulate VAD as a reconstruction or prediction problem. However the adaptability and scalability of these methods are limited. In this paper we propose a novel distance-based VAD method to take advantage of all the available normal data efficiently and flexibly. In our method the smaller the distance between a testing sample and normal samples the higher the probability that the testing sample is normal. Specifically we propose to use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to map samples whose similarity exceeds a certain threshold into the same bucket in advance. In this manner the complexity of near neighbor search is cut down significantly. To make the samples that are semantically similar get closer and samples not similar get further apart we propose a novel learnable version of LSH that embeds LSH into a neural network and optimizes the hash functions with contrastive learning strategy. The proposed method is robust to data imbalance and can handle the large intra-class variations in normal data flexibly. Besides it has a good ability of scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method which achieves new state-of-the-art results on VAD benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Recently deep hashing methods have been widely used in image retrieval task. Most existing deep hashing approaches adopt one-to-one quantization to reduce information loss. However such class-unrelated quantization cannot give discriminative feedback for network training. In addition these methods only utilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing function learning which may result in inferior network generalization performance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class information of data is totally ignored. In this paper we propose a dual semantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method which generates discriminative hash codes under three-fold constraints. Firstly DSAH utilizes class prior to conduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during the quantization process. Secondly a simple yet effective label mechanism is designed to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of data thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code learning. Finally a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised to minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an affinity graph. With these three main components high-quality hash codes can be generated through network. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSAH in comparison with state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.</p>

Although some authors have also proposed compact representations these drastically degrade the performance in a low dimension. Therefore in this work we present different results of evaluating methods for producing compact embeddings in the context of sketch-based image retrieval. Our main interest is in strategies aiming to keep the local structure of the original space. The recent unsupervised local-topology preserving dimension reduction method UMAP fits our requirements and shows outstanding performance improving even the precision achieved by SOTA methods. We evaluate six methods in two different datasets. We use Flickr15K and eCommerce datasets; the latter is another contribution of this work. We show that UMAP allows us to have feature vectors of 16 bytes improving precision by more than 35.</p>

In this context two types of image representations i.e. local and global image features have been studied in the literature. Extracting these features from pixel images and comparing them with images from the database is very time-consuming. Therefore in recent years there has been some effort to accomplish image analysis directly in the compressed domain with lesser computations. Furthermore most of the images in our daily transactions are stored in the JPEG compressed format. Therefore it would be ideal if we could retrieve features directly from the partially decoded or compressed data and use them for retrieval. Here we propose a unified model for image retrieval which takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local features directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval. The experimental findings indicate that our proposed model performed similarly to the current DELG model which takes RGB features as an input with reference to mean average precision while having a faster training and retrieval speed.</p>

	<td><p>Instance-level image retrieval is the task of searching in a large database for images that match an object in a query image. To address this task systems usually rely on a retrieval step that uses global image descriptors and a subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features. In this work we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset showing that RRTs outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local descriptors. Moreover we demonstrate that unlike existing approaches RRTs can be optimized jointly with the feature extractor which can lead to feature representations tailored to downstream tasks and further accuracy improvements.

A representation vector is produced using the averaged embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams with a pre-defined set of n. The hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to one type of non-language data â DNA sequences for gene classification. For both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong baselines suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and non-language data. Furthermore we find that simple compression using Huffman coding does not significantly impact the results which offers an accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.</p>

	<td><p>As a basic task of computer vision image similarity retrieval is facing the challenge of large-scale data and image copy attacks. This paper presents our 3rd place solution to the matching track of Image Similarity Challenge (ISC) 2021 organized by Facebook AI. We propose a multi-branch retrieval method of combining global descriptors and local descriptors to cover all attack cases. Specifically we attempt many strategies to optimize global descriptors including abundant data augmentations self-supervised learning with a single Transformer model overlay detection preprocessing. Moreover we introduce the robust SIFT feature and GPU Faiss for local retrieval which makes up for the shortcomings of the global retrieval. Finally KNN-matching algorithm is used to judge the match and merge scores. We show some ablation experiments of our method which reveals the complementary advantages of global and local features.</p>

However it is unsatisfied for current deep hashing methods to predict the similarity of hard examples. It exists two main factors affecting the ability of learning hard examples which are weak key features extraction and the shortage of hard examples. In this paper we give a novel end-to-end model to extract the key feature from hard examples and obtain hash code with the accurate semantic information. In addition we redesign a hard pair-wise loss function to assess the hard degree and update penalty weights of examples. It effectively alleviates the shortage problem in hard examples.

In this paper we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users everything is possible. Moreover using the hash values inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view based on our results deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is one of the most promising methods in cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search. Most CMH solutions ideally assume the labels of training and testing set are identical. However the assumption is often violated causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones using label attributes. However the attributes are isolated from the features of multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap we introduce an approach called LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing). LAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec model and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common subspace. Next it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix to guide the feature extraction network of different modalities. At the same time LAEH uses the attribute similarity as the supplement of label similarity to rectify the label embedding and common subspace. Experiments show that LAEH outperforms related representative zero-shot and cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

However deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in hashing-based retrieval field. In this paper we propose a novel prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN) which formulates a flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing attack. To the best of our knowledge this is the first generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally our proposed framework consists of three parts i.e. a PrototypeNet a generator and a discriminator. Specifically the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. Moreover the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for a flexible targeted attack. Particularly the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Furthermore the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic representation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack methods of deep hashing.

	<td><p>Machine learning on source code (MLOnCode) is a popular research field that has been driven by the availability of large-scale code repositories and the development of powerful probabilistic and deep learning models for mining source code. Code-to-code recommendation is a task in MLOnCode that aims to recommend relevant, diverse and concise code snippets that usefully extend the code currently being written by a developer in their development environment (IDE). Code-to-code recommendation engines hold the promise of increasing developer productivity by reducing context switching from the IDE and increasing code-reuse. Existing code-to-code recommendation engines do not scale gracefully to large codebases, exhibiting a linear growth in query time as the code repository increases in size. In addition, existing code-to-code recommendation engines fail to account for the global statistics of code repositories in the ranking function, such as the distribution of code snippet lengths, leading to sub-optimal retrieval results. We address both of these weaknesses with \emph{Senatus}, a new code-to-code recommendation engine. At the core of Senatus is \emph{De-Skew} LSH a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that indexes the data for fast (sub-linear time) retrieval while also counteracting the skewness in the snippet length distribution using novel abstract syntax tree-based feature scoring and selection algorithms. We evaluate Senatus via automatic evaluation and with an expert developer user study and find the recommendations to be of higher quality than competing baselines, while achieving faster search. For example, on the CodeSearchNet dataset we show that Senatus improves performance by 6.7% F1 and query time 16x is faster compared to Facebook Aroma on the task of code-to-code recommendation.</p>

	<td><p>With the advantages of low storage cost and extremely fast retrieval speed, deep hashing methods have attracted much attention for image retrieval recently. However, large-scale face image retrieval with significant intra-class variations is still challenging. Neither existing pairwise/triplet labels-based nor softmax classification loss-based deep hashing works can generate compact and discriminative binary codes. Considering these issues, we propose a center-based framework integrating end-to-end hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. The framework minimizes the intra-class variance by clustering intra-class samples into a learnable class center. To strengthen inter-class separability, it additionally imposes a novel regularization term to enlarge the Hamming distance between pairwise class centers. Moreover, a simple yet effective regression matrix is introduced to encourage intra-class samples to generate the same binary codes, which further enhances the hashing codes compactness. Experiments on four large-scale datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under various code lengths and commonly-used evaluation metrics.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the advantage of reducing storage while speeding up query time on big heterogeneous data cross-modal hashing has been extensively studied for approximate nearest neighbor search of multi-modal data. Most hashing methods assume that training data is class-balanced.However in practice real world data often have a long-tailed distribution. In this paper we introduce a meta-learning based cross-modal hashing method (MetaCMH) to handle long-tailed data. Due to the lack of training samples in the tail classes MetaCMH first learns direct features from data in different modalities and then introduces an associative memory module to learn the memory features of samples of the tail classes. It then combines the direct and memory features to obtain meta features for each sample. For samples of the head classes of the long tail distribution the weight of the direct features is larger because there are enough training data to learn them well; while for rare classes the weight of the memory features is larger. Finally MetaCMH uses a likelihood loss function to preserve the similarity in different modalities and learns hash functions in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on long-tailed datasets show that MetaCMH performs significantly better than state-of-the-art methods especially on the tail classes.</p>

In this paper a new classification-based indexing structure called Semantic Indexing Structure (SIS) is proposed in which we utilize the semantic categories rather than clustering centers to create database partitions such that the proposed index SIS can be combined with feature extractors without the restriction of dimensions. Besides it is observed that the size of each semantic partition is positively correlated with the semantic distribution of database. Along this way we found that when the partition number is normalized to five the proposed algorithm performed very well in all the tests.

Most existing privacy-preserving string comparison functions are either based on comparing sets of encoded character q-grams allow only exact matching of encrypted strings or they are aimed at long genomic sequences that have a small alphabet. The set-based privacy-preserving similarity functions commonly used to compare name and address strings in the context of privacy-preserving record linkage do not take the positions of sub-strings into account. As a result two very different strings can potentially be considered as an exact match leading to wrongly linked records. Existing set-based techniques also cannot identify the length of the longest common sub-string across two strings. In this paper we propose a novel approach for accurate and efficient privacy-preserving string matching based on suffix trees that are encoded using chained hashing. We incorporate a hashing based encoding technique upon the encoded suffixes to improve privacy against frequency attacks such as those exploiting Benfords law. Our approach allows various operations to be performed without the strings to be compared being revealed the length of the longest common sub-string do two strings have the same beginning middle or end and the longest common sub-string similarity between two strings. These functions allow a more accurate comparison of for example bank account credit card or telephone numbers which cannot be compared appropriately with existing privacy-preserving string matching techniques. Our evaluation on several data sets with different types of strings validates the privacy and accuracy of our proposed approach.</p>

We obtain state-of-the-art results on the Brueghel dataset and demonstrate its generalization to inhomogeneous collections with a large number of distractors.</p>

	<td><p>The high efficiency in computation and storage makes hashing (including binary hashing and quantization) a common strategy in large-scale retrieval systems. To alleviate the reliance on expensive annotations unsupervised deep hashing becomes an important research problem. This paper provides a novel solution to unsupervised deep quantization namely Contrastive Quantization with Code Memory (MeCoQ). Different from existing reconstruction-based strategies we learn unsupervised binary descriptors by contrastive learning which can better capture discriminative visual semantics. Besides we uncover that codeword diversity regularization is critical to prevent contrastive learning-based quantization from model degeneration. Moreover we introduce a novel quantization code memory module that boosts contrastive learning with lower feature drift than conventional feature memories. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MeCoQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code and configurations are publicly available at httpsgithub.com/gimpong/AAAI22-MeCoQ.</p>

	<td><p>Image hash algorithms generate compact binary representations that can be quickly matched by Hamming distance thus become an efficient solution for large-scale image retrieval. This paper proposes RV-SSDH a deep image hash algorithm that incorporates the classical VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) architecture into neural networks. Specifically a novel neural network component is formed by coupling a random VLAD layer with a latent hash layer through a transform layer. This component can be combined with convolutional layers to realize a hash algorithm. We implement RV-SSDH as a point-wise algorithm that can be efficiently trained by minimizing classification error and quantization loss. Comprehensive experiments show this new architecture significantly outperforms baselines such as NetVLAD and SSDH and offers a cost-effective trade-off in the state-of-the-art. In addition the proposed random VLAD layer leads to satisfactory accuracy with low complexity thus shows promising potentials as an alternative to NetVLAD.</p>

	<td><p>Weighted Hamming distance as a similarity measure between binary codes and binary queries provides superior accuracy in search tasks than Hamming distance. However how to efficiently and accurately find K binary codes that have the smallest weighted Hamming distance to the query remains an open issue. In this paper a fast search algorithm is proposed to perform the non-exhaustive search for K nearest binary codes by weighted Hamming distance. By using binary codes as direct bucket indices in a hash table the search algorithm generates a sequence to probe the buckets based on the independence characteristic of the weights for each bit. Furthermore a fast search framework based on the proposed search algorithm is designed to solve the problem of long binary codes. Specifically long binary codes are split into substrings and multiple hash tables are built on them. Then the search algorithm probes the buckets to obtain candidates according to the generated substring indices and a merging algorithm is proposed to find the nearest binary codes by merging the candidates. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the search algorithm improves the search accuracy compared to other non-exhaustive algorithms and provides orders-of-magnitude faster search than the linear scan baseline.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised binary representation allows fast data retrieval without any annotations enabling practical application like fast person re-identification and multimedia retrieval. It is argued that conflicts in binary space are one of the major barriers to high-performance unsupervised hashing as current methods failed to capture the precise code conflicts in the full domain. A novel relaxation method called Shuffle and Learn is proposed to tackle code conflicts in the unsupervised hash. Approximated derivatives for joint probability and the gradients for the binary layer are introduced to bridge the update from the hash to the input. Proof on epsilon-Convergence of joint probability with approximated derivatives is provided to guarantee the preciseness on update applied on the mutual information. The proposed algorithm is carried out with iterative global updates to minimize mutual information diverging the code before regular unsupervised optimization. Experiments suggest that the proposed method can relax the code optimization from local optimum and help to generate binary representations that are more discriminative and informative without any annotations. Performance benchmarks on image retrieval with the unsupervised binary code are conducted on three open datasets and the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on image retrieval task for all those datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework, the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore, inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space.

	<td><p>Efficient hashing techniques have attracted extensive research interests in both storage and retrieval of high dimensional data, such as images and videos. In existing hashing methods, a linear model is commonly utilized owing to its efficiency. To obtain better accuracy, linear-based hashing methods focus on designing a generalized linear objective function with different constraints or penalty terms that consider the inherent characteristics and neighborhood information of samples. Differing from existing hashing methods, in this study, we propose a self-improvement framework called Model Boost (MoBoost) to improve model parameter optimization for linear-based hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed MoBoost, for a linear-based hashing method, we first repeatedly execute the hashing method to obtain several hash codes to training samples. Then, utilizing two novel fusion strategies, these codes are fused into a single set. We also propose two new criteria to evaluate the goodness of hash bits during the fusion process. Based on the fused set of hash codes, we learn new parameters for the linear hash function that can significantly improve the accuracy. In general, the proposed MoBoost can be adopted by existing linear-based hashing methods, achieving more precise and stable performance compared to the original methods, and adopting the proposed MoBoost will incur negligible time and space costs. To evaluate the proposed MoBoost, we performed extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing-based cross-modal search which aims to map multiple modality features into binary codes has attracted increasingly attention due to its storage and search efficiency especially in large-scale database retrieval. Recent unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods have shown promising results. However, existing approaches typically suffer from two limitations: (1) They usually learn cross-modal similarity information separately or in a redundant fusion manner, which may fail to capture semantic correlations among instances from different modalities sufficiently and effectively. (2) They seldom consider the sampling and weighting schemes for unsupervised cross-modal hashing, resulting in the lack of satisfactory discriminative ability in hash codes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing method called Joint-modal Distribution-based Similarity Hashing (JDSH) for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we propose a novel cross-modal joint-training method by constructing a joint-modal similarity matrix to fully preserve the cross-modal semantic correlations among instances. Secondly, we propose a sampling and weighting scheme termed the Distribution-based Similarity Decision and Weighting (DSDW) method for unsupervised cross-modal hashing, which is able to generate more discriminative hash codes by pushing semantic similar instance pairs closer and pulling semantic dissimilar instance pairs apart. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of JDSH compared with several unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods on two public datasets NUS-WIDE and MIRFlickr.</p>

To address this issue in this study we propose a novel reinforcing short-length hashing (RSLH). In this proposed RSLH mutual reconstruction between the hash representation and semantic labels is performed to preserve the semantic information. Furthermore to enhance the accuracy of hash representation a pairwise similarity matrix is designed to make a balance between accuracy and training expenditure on memory. In addition a parameter boosting strategy is integrated to reinforce the precision with hash bits fusion. Extensive experiments on three large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of RSLH under various short-length hashing scenarios.</p>

Unlike most existing deep hashing methods which use a series of convolution and fully-connected layers to learn binary features, we develop a probabilistic framework to infer latent feature representation inside the network. Then, we design a struct layer rather than a bottleneck hash layer, to obtain binary codes through a simple encoding procedure. By doing these, we are able to obtain binary codes discriminatively and generatively. To make it applicable to cross-modal scalable multimedia retrieval, we extend our method to a cross-modal deep variational and structural hashing (CM-DVStH). We design a deep fusion network with a struct layer to maximize the correlation between image-text input pairs during the training stage so that a unified binary vector can be obtained. We then design modality-specific hashing networks to handle the out-of-sample extension scenario. Specifically, we train a network for each modality which outputs a latent representation that is as close as possible to the binary codes which are inferred from the fusion network. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>Online image hashing has received increasing research attention recently which processes large-scale data in a streaming fashion to update the hash functions on-the-fly. To this end most existing works exploit this problem under a supervised setting i.e. using class labels to boost the hashing performance which suffers from the defects in both adaptivity and efficiency First large amounts of training batches are required to learn up-to-date hash functions which leads to poor online adaptivity. Second the training is time-consuming which contradicts with the core need of online learning. In this paper a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed Fast Class-wise Updating for Online Hashing (FCOH) is proposed to address the above two challenges by introducing a novel and efficient inner product operation. To achieve fast online adaptivity a class-wise updating method is developed to decompose the binary code learning and alternatively renew the hash functions in a class-wise fashion which well addresses the burden on large amounts of training batches. Quantitatively such a decomposition further leads to at least 75 storage saving. To further achieve online efficiency we propose a semi-relaxation optimization which accelerates the online training by treating different binary constraints independently. Without additional constraints and variables the time complexity is significantly reduced. Such a scheme is also quantitatively shown to well preserve past information during updating hashing functions. We have quantitatively demonstrated that the collective effort of class-wise updating and semi-relaxation optimization provides a superior performance comparing to various state-of-the-art methods which is verified through extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets.</p>

We further employ a fuzzy hashing technique to convert the numeric graph signatures into smaller fixed-size fuzzy hash signatures for efficient similarity calculation. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TAH is more effective and efficient compared to existing CFG comparison techniques.

	<td><p>Supervised cross-modal hashing aims to embed the semantic correlations of heterogeneous modality data into the binary hash codes with discriminative semantic labels. Because of its advantages on retrieval and storage efficiency it is widely used for solving efficient cross-modal retrieval. However existing researches equally handle the different tasks of cross-modal retrieval and simply learn the same couple of hash functions in a symmetric way for them. Under such circumstance the uniqueness of different cross-modal retrieval tasks are ignored and sub-optimal performance may be brought. Motivated by this we present a Task-adaptive Asymmetric Deep Cross-modal Hashing (TA-ADCMH) method in this paper. It can learn task-adaptive hash functions for two sub-retrieval tasks via simultaneous modality representation and asymmetric hash learning. Unlike previous cross-modal hashing approaches our learning framework jointly optimizes semantic preserving that transforms deep features of multimedia data into binary hash codes and the semantic regression which directly regresses query modality representation to explicit label. With our model the binary codes can effectively preserve semantic correlations across different modalities meanwhile adaptively capture the query semantics. The superiority of TA-ADCMH is proved on two standard datasets from many aspects.</p>

First original image is subjected to normalization and Gaussian low-pass filtering to produce a secondary image which is divided into a series of ring-ribbons with different radii and the same number of pixels. Then both textural and color features are extracted locally and globally. Quadtree decomposition (QD) is applied on luminance values of the ring-ribbons to extract local textural features and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to extract global textural features. Local color features of significant corner points on outer boundaries of ring-ribbons are extracted through color vector angles (CVA) and color low-order moments (CLMs) is utilized to extract global color features. Finally two types of feature vectors are fused via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to prodcue the final hash after scrambling. Compared with direct concatenation the CCA feature fusion method improves classification performance which better reflects overall correlation between two sets of feature vectors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows that our scheme has satisfactory performances with respect to robustness discrimination and security which can be effectively used in copy detection and content authentication.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing is important for indexing huge image or video collections without having expensive annotations available. Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k Nus-wide Cifar-10 Mscoco Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Recently inspired by Transformer self-attention-based scene text recognition approaches have achieved outstanding performance. However we find that the size of model expands rapidly with the lexicon increasing. Specifically the number of parameters for softmax classification layer and output embedding layer are proportional to the vocabulary size. It hinders the development of a lightweight text recognition model especially applied for Chinese and multiple languages. Thus we propose a lightweight scene text recognition model named Hamming OCR. In this model a novel Hamming classifier which adopts locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to encode each character is proposed to replace the softmax regression and the generated LSH code is directly employed to replace the output embedding. We also present a simplified transformer decoder to reduce the number of parameters by removing the feed-forward network and using cross-layer parameter sharing technique. Compared with traditional methods the number of parameters in both classification and embedding layers is independent on the size of vocabulary which significantly reduces the storage requirement without loss of accuracy. Experimental results on several datasets including four public benchmaks and a Chinese text dataset synthesized by SynthText with more than 20000 characters shows that Hamming OCR achieves competitive results.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed hashing has been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically by using one hash code to represent one image existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper we propose a novel hashing framework called multiple code hashing (MCH) to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash bucket search compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for each image.</p>

Only the beginning part of the video is available as query and new frames are constantly added as the video plays out. To perform retrieval in this demanding situation we propose an approach based on a binary encoder that is both predictive and incremental in order to (1) account for the missing video content at query time and (2) keep up with repeated continuously evolving queries throughout the streaming. In particular we present the first hashing framework that infers the unseen future content of a currently playing video. Experiments on FCVID and ActivityNet demonstrate the feasibility of this task. Our approach also yields a significant mAP@20 performance increase compared to a baseline adapted from the literature for this task for instance 7.4 (2.6) increase at 20 (50) of elapsed runtime on FCVID using bitcodes of size 192 bits.</p>

This code can be used to apply fast and memory-efficient approximation to nearest-neighbor searches. Our framework is flexible enabling different proximity definitions between data points. In contrast to previous methods that extract binary codes based on unsigned graph partitioning our system models the attractive and repulsive forces in the data by incorporating positive and negative graph weights. The proposed framework is shown to boil down to finding the minimal cut of a signed graph a problem known to be NP-hard. We offer an efficient approximation and achieve superior results by constructing the code bit after bit. We show that the proposed approximation is superior to the commonly used spectral methods with respect to both accuracy and complexity. Thus it is useful for many other problems that can be translated into signed graph cut.</p>

	<td><p>Massive biometric deployments are pervasive in todays world. But despite the high accuracy of biometric systems their computational efficiency degrades drastically with an increase in the database size. Thus it is essential to index them. An ideal indexing scheme needs to generate codes that preserve the intra-subject similarity as well as inter-subject dissimilarity. Here in this paper we propose an iris indexing scheme using real-valued deep iris features binarized to iris bar codes (IBC) compatible with the indexing structure. Firstly for extracting robust iris features we have designed a network utilizing the domain knowledge of ordinal filtering and learning their nonlinear combinations. Later these real-valued features are binarized. Finally for indexing the iris dataset we have proposed a loss that can transform the binary feature into an improved feature compatible with the Multi-Index Hashing scheme. This loss function ensures the hamming distance equally distributed among all the contiguous disjoint sub-strings. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work in the iris indexing domain that presents an end-to-end iris indexing structure. Experimental results on four datasets are presented to depict the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has become a hot topic recently. Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However current UCMH methods calculate the similarity between two data mainly relying on the two datas cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space because the cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the complex data relationships such as situations where two data have different feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper we devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN). Specifically DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors. DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three types of data similarities (i.e. the graph-neighbor coherence the coexistent similarity and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization errors during hashing. Essentially DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity problem by exploring and exploiting the datas intrinsic relationships in a graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN e.g. by improving the mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit hashing codes to retrieve texts from images. We will release the source code package and the trained model on httpsgithub.com/Atmegal/DGCPN.</p>

Most of the previous related work focus on improving recommendation accuracy instead of efficiency. In this paper we propose a Deep Pairwise Hashing (DPH) to map users and items to binary vectors in Hamming space where a users preference for an item can be efficiently calculated by Hamming distance which significantly improves the efficiency of online recommendation. To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems the user-item interactive information and item content information are unified to learn effective representations of items and users. Specifically we first pre-train robust item representation from item content data by a Denoising Auto-encoder instead of other deterministic deep learning frameworks; then we finetune the entire framework by adding a pairwise loss objective with discrete constraints; moreover DPH aims to minimize a pairwise ranking loss that is consistent with the ultimate goal of recommendation. Finally we adopt the alternating optimization method to optimize the proposed model with discrete constraints. Extensive experiments on three different datasets show that DPH can significantly advance the state-of-the-art frameworks regarding data sparsity and item cold-start recommendation.</p>

It seeks to preserve fine-grained similarity among data with rich semantics while explicitly require distances between dissimilar points to be larger than a specific value for strong robustness. For this we give an effective bound of this value based on the information coding-theoretic analysis and the above goals are embodied into a margin-adaptive triplet loss. Furthermore we introduce pseudo-codes via fusing multiple hash codes to explore seldom-seen semantics alleviating the sparsity problem of similarity information. Experiments on three benchmarks show the validity of the derived bounds and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

	<td><p>Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques the entire model can be optimized efficiently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code our model can achieve significant performance gains.</p>

Many counterfeits can be identified once installed however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation. To this end this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted for publication. We show that a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT SURF and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that content style and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10-15 and 12-25 respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem combined content and style embeddings achieve 12 and 14 increase in precision@k and recall@k respectively compared to the baseline methods. Third we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption we were able to find 2040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49608 apps that showed high similarity to one of the top-10000 popular apps in Google Play Store. We also find 1565 potential counterfeits asking for at least five additional dangerous permissions than the original app and 1407 potential counterfeits having at least five extra third party advertisement libraries.</p>

We develop locality sensitive hash families and data structures for a large set of such arithmetic and geometric averaging similarities and analyze their collision probabilities. We also establish an analogous framework and hash families for distance functions. Specifically we give a structure for the euclidean distance aggregated by either averaging or taking the maximum. We leverage SLSH to solve a geometric extension of the approximate near neighbors problem. In this version we consider a metric for which the unit ball is an ellipsoid and its orientation is specified with the query. An important application that motivates our work is group recommendation systems. Such a system embeds movies and users in the same feature space and the task of recommending a movie for a group to watch together translates to a set-query Q using an appropriate similarity.</p>

	<td><p>Embedding learning of categorical features (e.g. user/item IDs) is at the core of various recommendation models including matrix factorization and neural collaborative filtering. The standard approach creates an embedding table where each row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every unique feature value. However this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality features and unseen feature values (e.g. new video ID) that are prevalent in real-world recommendation systems. In this paper we propose an alternative embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE) replacing embedding tables by a deep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. DHE first encodes the feature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and transformations and then applies a DNN to convert the identifier vector to an embedding. The encoding module is deterministic non-learnable and free of storage while the embedding network is updated during the training time to learn embedding generation. Empirical results show that DHE achieves comparable AUC against the standard one-hot full embedding with smaller model sizes. Our work sheds light on the design of DNN-based alternative embedding schemes for categorical features without using embedding table lookup.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a core technique for fast similarity searches and it randomly maps data points in a metric space to strings of discrete symbols (i.e. sketches) in the Hamming space. While traditional hashing techniques produce binary sketches recent ones produce integer sketches for preserving various similarity measures. However most similarity search methods are designed for binary sketches and inefficient for integer sketches. Moreover most methods are either inapplicable or inefficient for dynamic datasets although modern real-world datasets are updated over time. We propose dynamic filter trie (DyFT) a dynamic similarity search method for both binary and integer sketches. An extensive experimental analysis using large real-world datasets shows that DyFT performs superiorly with respect to scalability time performance and memory efficiency. For example on a huge dataset of 216 million data points DyFT performs a similarity search 6000 times faster than a state-of-the-art method while reducing to one-thirteenth in memory.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data, which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However, existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes, leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides, most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method, named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images, first, the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second, we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones, we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its effectivity and efficiency deep hashing approaches are widely used for large-scale visual search. However it is still challenging to produce compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple semantics for two main reasons 1) similarity constraints designed in most of the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity assignment(i.e. 0 for instance pairs sharing no label 1 for instance pairs sharing at least 1 label) 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for the semantics of the given dataset which efficiently and precisely guides a feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries a new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity searching and robust hash code generation. Extensive empirical research on four popular benchmarks validates the proposed method and shows it outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common
center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers, to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept, i.e. hash center that refers to a set
of data points scattered in the Hamming space with sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash
centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli
distributions. Finally, we propose the Central Similarity
Hashing (CSH) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. The CSH is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval demonstrate CSH can generate cohesive hash codes for similar
data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs,
and achieve noticeable boost in retrieval performance, i.e.
3%-20% in mAP over the previous state-of-the-art. The

	<td><p>Nearest neighbor search is fundamental to a wide range of applications. Since the exact nearest neighbor search suffers from the curse of dimensionality approximate approaches such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are widely used to trade a little query accuracy for a much higher query efficiency. In many scenarios it is necessary to perform nearest neighbor search under multiple weighted distance functions in high-dimensional spaces. This paper considers the important problem of supporting efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for multiple weighted distance functions in high-dimensional spaces. To the best of our knowledge prior work can only solve the problem for the l_2 distance. However numerous studies have shown that the l_p distance with pin(02) could be more effective than the l_2 distance in high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel method WLSH to address the problem for the l_p distance for pin(02. WLSH takes the LSH approach and can theoretically guarantee both the efficiency of processing queries and the accuracy of query results while minimizing the required total number of hash tables. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets and the results show that WLSH achieves high performance in terms of query efficiency query accuracy and space consumption.</p>

In the first step we propose a novel spectral embedding-based algorithm to simultaneously learn single-modality and binary cross-modality representations. While the former is capable of well preserving the local structure of each modality the latter reveals the hidden patterns from all modalities.

	<td><p>In the era of big data methods for improving memory and computational efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies. Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary codes. However due to binary constraints the optimization becomes intractable. To mitigate this challenge different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore instead of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to the data points we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization techniques namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold to obtain the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets we show that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low complexity.</p>

	<td><p>This paper presents several algorithms for hashing directed graphs. The algorithms given are capable of hashing entire graphs as well as assigning hash values to specific nodes in a given graph. The notion of node symmetry is made precise via computation of vertex orbits and the graph automorphism group and nodes that are symmetrically identical are assigned equal hashes. We also present a novel Merkle-style hashing algorithm that seeks to fulfill the recursive principle that a hash of a node should depend only on the hash of its neighbors. This algorithm works even in the presence of cycles which would not be possible with a naive approach. Structurally hashing trees has seen widespread use in blockchain source code version control and web applications. Despite the popularity of tree hashing directed graph hashing remains unstudied in the literature. Our algorithms open new possibilities to hashing both directed graphs and more complex data structures that can be reduced to directed graphs such as hypergraphs.</p>

	<td><p>Semantic Hashing is a popular family of methods for efficient similarity search in large-scale datasets. In Semantic Hashing documents are encoded as short binary vectors (i.e. hash codes) such that semantic similarity can be efficiently computed using the Hamming distance. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have utilized weak supervision to train better performing hashing models. Inspired by this we present Semantic Hashing with Pairwise Reconstruction (PairRec) which is a discrete variational autoencoder based hashing model. PairRec first encodes weakly supervised training pairs (a query document and a semantically similar document) into two hash codes and then learns to reconstruct the same query document from both of these hash codes (i.e. pairwise reconstruction). This pairwise reconstruction enables our model to encode local neighbourhood structures within the hash code directly through the decoder. We experimentally compare PairRec to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches and obtain significant performance improvements in the task of document similarity search.</p>

	<td><p>Content-aware recommendation approaches are essential for providing meaningful recommendations for (i.e. ) items in a recommender system. We present a content-aware neural hashing-based collaborative filtering approach (NeuHash-CF) which generates binary hash codes for users and items such that the highly efficient Hamming distance can be used for estimating user-item relevance. NeuHash-CF is modelled as an autoencoder architecture consisting of two joint hashing components for generating user and item hash codes. Inspired from semantic hashing the item hashing component generates a hash code directly from an items content information (i.e. it generates cold-start and seen item hash codes in the same manner). This contrasts existing state-of-the-art models which treat the two item cases separately. The user hash codes are generated directly based on user id through learning a user embedding matrix. We show experimentally that NeuHash-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 12 NDCG and 13 MRR in cold-start recommendation settings and up to 4 in both NDCG and MRR in standard settings where all items are present while training. Our approach uses 2-4x shorter hash codes while obtaining the same or better performance compared to the state of the art thus consequently also enabling a notable storage reduction.</p>

	<td><p>Node classification in structural networks has been proven to be useful in many real world applications. With the development of network embedding the performance of node classification has been greatly improved. However nearly all the existing network embedding based methods are hard to capture the actual category features of a node because of the linearly inseparable problem in low-dimensional space; meanwhile they cannot incorporate simultaneously network structure information and node label information into network embedding. To address the above problems in this paper we propose a novel Deep Kernel Supervised Hashing (DKSH) method to learn the hashing representations of nodes for node classification. Specifically a deep multiple kernel learning is first proposed to map nodes into suitable Hilbert space to deal with linearly inseparable problem. Then instead of only considering structural similarity between two nodes a novel similarity matrix is designed to merge both network structure information and node label information. Supervised by the similarity matrix the learned hashing representations of nodes simultaneously preserve the two kinds of information well from the learned Hilbert space. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines over three real world benchmark datasets.</p>

The approach does not include any fine-tuning or cross-domain learning and is therefore efficient and possibly applicable to arbitrary datasets and classes. We investigate several flavors of the proposed approach some including multi-layers perceptron and polyhedral classifiers.

	<td><p>Existing data-dependent hashing methods usually learn hash functions from pairwise or triplet data relationships, which only capture the data similarity locally, and often suffer from low learning efficiency and low collision rate. In this work, we propose a new global similarity metric, termed as central similarity, with which the hash codes of similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers, to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept, i.e., hash center that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally, we propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs, achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval performance, i.e. 3%-20% in mAP over the previous state-of-the-arts.</p>

The idea of neural codes based on fully connected layers activations is extended by incorporating the information contained in convolutional layers. It is known that the total number of neurons in the convolutional part of the network is large and the majority of them have little influence on the final classification decision. Therefore in the paper we propose a novel algorithm that allows us to extract the most significant neuron activations and utilize this information to construct effective descriptors. The descriptors consisting of values taken from both the fully connected and convolutional layers perfectly represent the whole image content. The images retrieved using these descriptors match semantically very well to the query image and also they are similar in other secondary image characteristics like background textures or color distribution. These features of the proposed descriptors are verified experimentally based on the IMAGENET1M dataset using the VGG16 neural network.</p>

	<td><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) has been a hot research topic because of its theoretic and practical importance. As a classic CO problem deep hashing aims to find an optimal code for each data from finite discrete possibilities while the discrete nature brings a big challenge to the optimization process. Previous methods usually mitigate this challenge by binary approximation substituting binary codes for real-values via activation functions or regularizations. However such approximation leads to uncertainty between real-values and binary ones degrading retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH). It explicitly estimates the uncertainty during training and leverages the uncertainty information to guide the approximation process. Specifically we model bit-level uncertainty via measuring the discrepancy between the output of a hashing network and that of a momentum-updated network. The discrepancy of each bit indicates the uncertainty of the hashing network to the approximate output of that bit. Meanwhile the mean discrepancy of all bits in a hashing code can be regarded as image-level uncertainty. It embodies the uncertainty of the hashing network to the corresponding input image. The hashing bit and image with higher uncertainty are paid more attention during optimization. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to study the uncertainty in hashing bits. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to verify the superiority of our method including CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE MS-COCO and a million-scale dataset Clothing1M. Our method achieves the best performance on all of the datasets and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p>

However when the salient region plays a maximal discriminative role in ophthalmic image existing deep hashing methods do not fully exploit the learning ability of the deep network to capture the features of salient regions pointedly. The different grades or classes of ophthalmic images may be share similar overall performance but have subtle differences that can be differentiated by mining salient regions. To address this issue we propose a novel end-to-end network named Attention-based Saliency Hashing (ASH) for learning compact hash-code to represent ophthalmic images. ASH embeds a spatial-attention module to focus more on the representation of salient regions and highlights their essential role in differentiating ophthalmic images. Benefiting from the spatial-attention module the information of salient regions can be mapped into the hash-code for similarity calculation. In the training stage we input the image pairs to share the weights of the network and a pairwise loss is designed to maximize the discriminability of the hash-code. In the retrieval stage ASH obtains the hash-code by inputting an image with an end-to-end manner then the hash-code is used to similarity calculation to return the most similar images. Extensive experiments on two different modalities of ophthalmic image datasets demonstrate that the proposed ASH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods due to the huge contributions of the spatial-attention module.</p>

Despite its effectiveness in learning embedding vectors for objects in the user-item interaction network the computational costs to infer users preferences in continuous embedding space are tremendous. In this work we investigate the problem of hashing with graph neural networks (GNNs) for high quality retrieval and propose a simple yet effective discrete representation learning framework to jointly learn continuous and discrete codes. Specifically a deep hashing with GNNs (HashGNN) is presented which consists of two components a GNN encoder for learning node representations and a hash layer for encoding representations to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two losses i.e. reconstruction loss from reconstructing observed links and ranking loss from preserving the relative ordering of hash codes. A novel discrete optimization strategy based on straight through estimator (STE) with guidance is proposed. The principal idea is to avoid gradient magnification in back-propagation of STE with continuous embedding guidance in which we begin from learning an easier network that mimic the continuous embedding and let it evolve during the training until it finally goes back to STE. Comprehensive experiments over three publicly available and one real-world Alibaba company datasets demonstrate that our model not only can achieve comparable performance compared with its continuous counterpart but also runs multiple times faster during inference.</p>

In both cases experiment results demonstrated that we can reduce the model size by around 90 while keeping the performance on par with the original baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Diffusion has shown great success in improving accuracy of unsupervised image retrieval systems by utilizing high-order structures of image manifold. However existing diffusion methods suffer from three major limitations 1) they usually rely on local structures without considering global manifold information; 2) they focus on improving pair-wise similarities within existing images input output transductively while lacking flexibility to learn representations for novel unseen instances inductively; 3) they fail to scale to large datasets due to prohibitive memory consumption and computational burden due to intrinsic high-order operations on the whole graph. In this paper to address these limitations we propose a novel method Graph Diffusion Networks (GRAD-Net) that adopts graph neural networks (GNNs) a novel variant of deep learning algorithms on irregular graphs. GRAD-Net learns semantic representations by exploiting both local and global structures of image manifold in an unsupervised fashion. By utilizing sparse coding techniques GRAD-Net not only preserves global information on the image manifold but also enables scalable training and efficient querying. Experiments on several large benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art diffusion algorithms for unsupervised image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing images with a perceptual algorithm is a common approach to solving duplicate image detection problems. However perceptual image hashing algorithms are differentiable and are thus vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that not only is it possible to modify an image to produce an unrelated hash but an exact image hash collision between a source and target image can be produced via minuscule adversarial perturbations. In a white box setting these collisions can be replicated across nearly every image pair and hash type (including both deep and non-learned hashes). Furthermore by attacking points other than the output of a hashing function an attacker can avoid having to know the details of a particular algorithm resulting in collisions that transfer across different hash sizes or model architectures. Using these techniques an adversary can poison the image lookup table of a duplicate image detection service resulting in undefined or unwanted behavior. Finally we offer several potential mitigations to gradient-based image hash attacks.</p>

	<td><p>Image retrieval relies heavily on the quality of the data modeling and the distance measurement in the feature space. Building on the concept of image manifold we first propose to represent the feature space of images learned via neural networks as a graph. Neighborhoods in the feature space are now defined by the geodesic distance between images represented as graph vertices or manifold samples. When limited images are available this manifold is sparsely sampled making the geodesic computation and the corresponding retrieval harder. To address this we augment the manifold samples with geometrically aligned text thereby using a plethora of sentences to teach us about images. In addition to extensive results on standard datasets illustrating the power of text to help in image retrieval a new public dataset based on CLEVR is introduced to quantify the semantic similarity between visual data and text data. The experimental results show that the joint embedding manifold is a robust representation allowing it to be a better basis to perform image retrieval given only an image and a textual instruction on the desired modifications over the image</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is one of the fundamental problems that demand both efficient and effective solutions for various practical scenarios. Adversarial autoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust locality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash codes. However the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be employed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically they require an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash codes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper we show that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal retrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this challenge we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically by exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional discrete space our method efficiently estimates a better variant of Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional Wasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude better sample complexity thus better generalization property compared to the other adversarial hashing methods. In addition the computational cost is significantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing methods achieving up to 10 improvement over the current state-of-the-art image hashing methods. The code accompanying this paper is available on Github (httpsgithub.com/khoadoan/adversarial-hashing).</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is an effective technique to address the large-scale recommendation problem due to its high computation and storage efficiency on calculating the user preferences on items. However existing hashing-based recommendation methods still suffer from two important problems 1) Their recommendation process mainly relies on the user-item interactions and single specific content feature. When the interaction history or the content feature is unavailable (the cold-start problem) their performance will be seriously deteriorated. 2) Existing methods learn the hash codes with relaxed optimization or adopt discrete coordinate descent to directly solve binary hash codes which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. In this paper we propose a fast cold-start recommendation method called Multi-Feature Discrete Collaborative Filtering (MFDCF) to solve these problems. Specifically a low-rank self-weighted multi-feature fusion module is designed to adaptively project the multiple content features into binary yet informative hash codes by fully exploiting their complementarity. Additionally we develop a fast discrete optimization algorithm to directly compute the binary hash codes with simple operations. Experiments on two public recommendation datasets demonstrate that MFDCF outperforms the state-of-the-arts on various aspects.</p>

Yet the effectiveness of dense retrieval (DR) often requires combination with sparse retrieval. In this paper we identify that the main bottleneck is in the training mechanisms where the negative instances used in training are not representative of the irrelevant documents in testing. This paper presents Approximate nearest neighbor Negative Contrastive Estimation (ANCE) a training mechanism that constructs negatives from an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index of the corpus which is parallelly updated with the learning process to select more realistic negative training instances. This fundamentally resolves the discrepancy between the data distribution used in the training and testing of DR. In our experiments ANCE boosts the BERT-Siamese DR model to outperform all competitive dense and sparse retrieval baselines. It nearly matches the accuracy of sparse-retrieval-and-BERT-reranking using dot-product in the ANCE-learned representation space and provides almost 100x speed-up.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid development of social websites recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of social images with user-provided tags which continuously arrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing attention. However existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are based on batch mode which violates the nature of social images i.e. social images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion. Although there exist many online image hashing methods they either adopt unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags or are designed in the supervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper to overcome the above limitations we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online Hashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes WOH exploits the weak supervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise. Besides We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH which is efficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several state-of-the-art hashing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search due to its storage and search efficiency. Recent supervised hashing research has shown that deep learning-based methods can significantly outperform nondeep methods. Most existing supervised deep hashing methods exploit supervisory signals to generate similar and dissimilar image pairs for training. However, natural images can have large intraclass and small interclass variations, which may degrade the accuracy of hash codes. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stream ConvNet architecture, which learns hash codes with class-specific representation centers. Our basic idea is that if we can learn a unified binary representation for each class as a center and encourage hash codes of images to be close to the corresponding centers, the intraclass variation will be greatly reduced. Accordingly, we design a neural network that leverages label information and outputs a unified binary representation for each class. Moreover, we also design an image network to learn hash codes from images and force these hash codes to be close to the corresponding class-specific centers. These two neural networks are then seamlessly incorporated to create a unified, end-to-end trainable framework. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks corroborate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to generate fixed-length vector embeddings for a dataset of strings and the loss function is a combination of the triplet loss and the approximation error. To justify our choice of using CNN instead of other structures (e.g. RNN) as the model theoretical analysis is conducted to show that some basic operations in our CNN model preserve edit distance. Experimental results show that CNN-ED outperforms data-independent CGK embedding and RNN-based GRU embedding in terms of both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin.

Specifically we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints it can firstly obtain both local and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects respectively. Furthermore to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meanings consistency of these part-level features across images we design a local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments our proposal consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets which shows our effectiveness. Moreover compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction revealing its efficiency and practicality.</p>

Our approach also gives rise to a technique for computing fully independent locality-sensitive hash values for (L K)-parameterized approximate near neighbor search under weighted Jaccard similarity in optimal expected time O(LK + Vert x Vert_0) improving on prior work even in the case of unweighted sets.</p>

	<td><p>Social network stores and disseminates a tremendous amount of user shared images. Deep hashing is an efficient indexing technique to support large-scale social image retrieval due to its deep representation capability fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Particularly unsupervised deep hashing has well scalability as it does not require any manually labelled data for training. However owing to the lacking of label guidance existing methods suffer from severe semantic shortage when optimizing a large amount of deep neural network parameters. Differently in this paper we propose a Dual-level Semantic Transfer Deep Hashing (DSTDH) method to alleviate this problem with a unified deep hash learning framework. Our model targets at learning the semantically enhanced deep hash codes by specially exploiting the user-generated tags associated with the social images. Specifically we design a complementary dual-level semantic transfer mechanism to efficiently discover the potential semantics of tags and seamlessly transfer them into binary hash codes. On the one hand instance-level semantics are directly preserved into hash codes from the associated tags with adverse noise removing. Besides an image-concept hypergraph is constructed for indirectly transferring the latent high-order semantic correlations of images and tags into hash codes. Moreover the hash codes are obtained simultaneously with the deep representation learning by the discrete hash optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on two public social image retrieval datasets validate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art hashing methods. The source codes of our method can be obtained at httpsgithub.com/research2020-1/DSTDH</p>

This paper proposes a new technique that enables the selection of nearest neighbors directly in the neighborhood of a given observation. The proposed approach consists of dividing the data space into subcells of a virtual grid built on top of data space. The mapping between the data points and subcells is performed using hashing. When it comes to select the nearest neighbors of a given observation we firstly identify the cell the observation belongs by using hashing and then we look for nearest neighbors from that central cell and cells around it layer by layer. From our experiment performance analysis on publicly available datasets our algorithm outperforms the original KNN in time efficiency with a prediction quality as good as that of KNN it also offers competitive performance with solutions like KDtree</p>

Second the computational cost and the memory consumption increase extraordinarily in the big data setting which perplexes the training procedure. Third the lack of labeled data hinders the improvement of the model performance. To address these difficulties we utilize online sketching hashing (OSH) and present a FasteR Online Sketching Hashing (FROSH) algorithm to sketch the data in a more compact form via an independent transformation. We provide theoretical justification to guarantee that our proposed FROSH consumes less time and achieves a comparable sketching precision under the same memory cost of OSH. We also extend FROSH to its distributed implementation namely DFROSH to further reduce the training time cost of FROSH while deriving the theoretical bound of the sketching precision. Finally we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the attractive merits of FROSH and DFROSH.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the exponential growth of multimedia data, multi-modal hashing as a promising technique to make cross-view retrieval scalable is attracting more and more attention. However, most of the existing multi-modal hashing methods either divide the learning process unnaturally into two separate stages or treat the discrete optimization problem simplistically as a continuous one, which leads to suboptimal results. Recently, a few discrete multi-modal hashing methods that try to address such issues have emerged, but they still ignore several important discrete constraints (such as the balance and decorrelation of hash bits). In this paper, we overcome those limitations by proposing a novel method named âEnhanced Discrete Multi-modal Hashing (EDMH)â which learns binary codes and hashing functions simultaneously from the pairwise similarity matrix of data, under the aforementioned discrete constraints. Although the model of EDMH looks a lot more complex than the other models for multi-modal hashing, we are actually able to develop a fast iterative learning algorithm for it, since the subproblems of its optimization all have closed-form solutions after introducing two auxiliary variables. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets have demonstrated that EDMH not only performs much better than state-of-the-art competitors but also runs much faster than them.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash is a fundamental technique widely used in large-scale image retrieval. Most existing methods for learning to hash address the involved discrete optimization problem by the continuous relaxation of the binary constraint, which usually leads to large quantization errors and consequently suboptimal binary codes. A few discrete hashing methods have emerged recently. However, they either completely ignore some useful constraints (specifically the balance and decorrelation of hash bits) or just turn those constraints into regularizers that would make the optimization easier but less accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method named Strongly Constrained Discrete Hashing (SCDH) which overcomes such limitations. It can learn the binary codes for all examples in the training set, and meanwhile obtain a hash function for unseen samples with the above mentioned constraints preserved. Although the model of SCDH is fairly sophisticated, we are able to find closed-form solutions to all of its optimization subproblems and thus design an efficient algorithm that converges quickly. In addition, we extend SCDH to a kernelized version SCDH K . Our experiments on three large benchmark datasets have demonstrated that not only can SCDH and SCDH K achieve substantially higher MAP scores than state-of-the-art baselines, but they train much faster than those that are also supervised as well.</p>

This results in NECD cancorrect the corrupted hash codes generated by ADCMH up to the Hamming distance of m.

	<td><p>This paper aims to deliver an efficient and modified approach for image retrieval using multiple neural hash codes and limiting the number of queries using bloom filters by identifying false positives beforehand. Traditional approaches involving neural networks for image retrieval tasks tend to use higher layers for feature extraction. But it has been seen that the activations of lower layers have proven to be more effective in a number of scenarios. In our approach we have leveraged the use of local deep convolutional neural networks which combines the powers of both the features of lower and higher layers for creating feature maps which are then compressed using PCA and fed to a bloom filter after binary sequencing using a modified multi k-means approach. The feature maps obtained are further used in the image retrieval process in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner by first comparing the images in the higher layers for semantically similar images and then gradually moving towards the lower layers searching for structural similarities. While searching the neural hashes for the query image are again calculated and queried in the bloom filter which tells us whether the query image is absent in the set or maybe present. If the bloom filter doesnt necessarily rule out the query then it goes into the image retrieval process. This approach can be particularly helpful in cases where the image store is distributed since the approach supports parallel querying.</p>

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient. We conduct experiments on three public benchmarks containing up to one million descriptors and show that the proposed DAQ method consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art quantization methods.</p>

However most prior methods have focused on the case where image and text convey redundant information; in contrast real-world image-text pairs convey complementary information with little overlap. Further images in news articles and media portray topics in a visually diverse fashion; thus we need to take special care to ensure a meaningful image representation. We propose novel within-modality losses which encourage semantic coherency in both the text and image subspaces which does not necessarily align with visual coherency. Our method ensures that not only are paired images and texts close but the expected image-image and text-text relationships are also observed.

	<td><p>The Tor darknet hosts different types of illegal content which are monitored by cybersecurity agencies. However manually classifying Tor content can be slow and error-prone. To support this task we introduce Frequency-Dominant Neighborhood Structure (F-DNS) a new perceptual hashing method for automatically classifying domains by their screenshots. First we evaluated F-DNS using images subject to various content preserving operations. We compared them with their original images achieving better correlation coefficients than other state-of-the-art methods especially in the case of rotation. Then we applied F-DNS to categorize Tor domains using the Darknet Usage Service Images-2K (DUSI-2K) a dataset with screenshots of active Tor service domains. Finally we measured the performance of F-DNS against an image classification approach and a state-of-the-art hashing method. Our proposal obtained 98.75 accuracy in Tor images surpassing all other methods compared.</p>

	<td><p>Resolution of the complex problem of image retrieval for diagram images has yet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of object detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However the application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited due to lack of crucial features such as texturescolor and intensity information. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based search for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural image repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not identical to diagrams but they do share some characteristics; for example both imagery types are gray scale (binary) composed of contours and are lacking in texture). We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for image retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We then use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer learning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams. Our experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer learning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying similar images based on content.</p>

	<td><p>Fast image retrieval is of great importance in many computer vision tasks and especially practical applications. Deep hashing, the state-of-the-art fast image retrieval scheme, introduces deep learning to learn the hash functions and generate binary hash codes, and outperforms the other image retrieval methods in terms of accuracy. However, all the existing deep hashing methods could only generate one level hash codes and require a linear traversal of all the hash codes to figure out the closest one when a new query arrives, which is very time-consuming and even intractable for large scale applications. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Hashing(HDHash) scheme to speed up the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. More specifically, hierarchical deep hash codes of multiple levels can be generated and indexed with tree structures rather than linear ones, and pruning irrelevant branches can sharply decrease the retrieval time. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to introduce hierarchical indexed deep hashing for fast large scale image retrieval. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HDHash scheme achieves better or comparable accuracy with significantly improved efficiency and reduced memory as compared to state-of- the-art fast image retrieval schemes.</p>

Most existing studies proposed to alleviate the cold-start problem are also known as hybrid recommender systems that learn representations of users and items by combining user-item interactive and user/item content information. However previous hybrid methods regularly suffered poor efficiency bottlenecking in online recommendations with large-scale items because they were designed to project users and items into continuous latent space where the online recommendation is expensive. To this end we propose a collaborative generated hashing (CGH) framework to improve the efficiency by denoting users and items as binary codes then fast hashing search techniques can be used to speed up the online recommendation. In addition the proposed CGH can generate potential users or items for marketing application where the generative network is designed with the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL) which is used to learn compact and informative binary codes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the advantages for recommendations in various settings over competing baselines and analyze its feasibility in marketing application.</p>

This scenario is called instance or object retrieval and requires matching fine-grained visual patterns between images. Semantics however do not play a crucial role. This brings rise to the question Do the recent advances in instance retrieval transfer to more generic image retrieval scenarios To answer this question we first provide a brief overview of the most relevant milestones of instance retrieval. We then apply them to a semantic image retrieval task and find that they perform inferior to much less sophisticated and more generic methods in a setting that requires image understanding. Following this we review existing approaches to closing this so-called semantic gap by integrating prior world knowledge. We conclude that the key problem for the further advancement of semantic image retrieval lies in the lack of a standardized task definition and an appropriate benchmark dataset.</p>

One of the key obstacles crawlers face is the state similarity problem how to determine if two client-side states are equivalent. As current methods do not completely solve this problem a successful scan of many real-world RIAs is still not possible. We present a novel approach to detect redundant content for security testing purposes. The algorithm applies locality-sensitive hashing using MinHash sketches in order to analyze the Document Object Model (DOM) structure of web pages and to efficiently estimate similarity between them.

	<td><p>Learning to hash is an efficient paradigm for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search from massive databases. Binary hash codes are typically extracted from an image by rounding output features from a CNN which is trained on a supervised binary similar/ dissimilar task. Drawbacks of this approach are (i) resulting codes do not necessarily capture semantic similarity of the input data (ii) rounding results in information loss manifesting as decreased retrieval performance and (iii) Using only class-wise similarity as a target can lead to trivial solutions simply encoding classifier outputs rather than learning more intricate relations which is not detected by most performance metrics. We overcome (i) via a novel loss function encouraging the relative hash code distances of learned features to match those derived from their targets. We address (ii) via a differentiable estimate of the KL divergence between network outputs and a binary target distribution resulting in minimal information loss when the features are rounded to binary. Finally we resolve (iii) by focusing on a hierarchical precision metric. Efficiency of the methods is demonstrated with semantic image retrieval on the CIFAR-100 ImageNet and Conceptual Captions datasets using similarities inferred from the WordNet label hierarchy or sentence embeddings.</p>

Specifically we use our dual-branch architecture as a universal representation framework to design two sketch-specific deep models (i) We propose a deep hashing model for sketch retrieval where a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the abstract and messy traits of sketches.

We present a practical approach to MAC address anonymization using both computationally expensive hash functions and truncating the resulting hashes to allow for k-anonymity. We provide an expression for computing the percentage of expected collisions demonstrating that for digests of 24 bits it is possible to store up to 168617 MAC addresses with the rate of collisions less than 1.

For a fast computation of the polynomial the prime p is often chosen as a Mersenne prime p=2^b-1. In this paper we show that there are other nice advantages to using Mersenne primes. Our view is that the hash functions output is a b-bit integer that is uniformly distributed in 0 dots 2^b-1 except that p (the all texttt1s value in binary) is missing. Uniform bit strings have many nice properties such as splitting into substrings which gives us two or more hash functions for the cost of one while preserving strong theoretical qualities. We call this trick Two for one hashing and we demonstrate it on 4-universal hashing in the classic Count Sketch algorithm for second-moment estimation. We also provide a new fast branch-free code for division and modulus with Mersenne primes. Contrasting our analytic work this code generalizes to any Pseudo-Mersenne primes p=2^b-c for small c.</p>

	<td><p>To get estimators that work within a certain error bound with high probability a common strategy is to design one that works with constant probability and then boost the probability using independent repetitions. Important examples of this approach are small space algorithms for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream or estimating the set similarity between large sets. Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each element we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large error is say 1/4. By performing r independent repetitions and taking the median of the estimators the error probability falls exponentially in r. However running r independent experiments increases the processing time by a factor r. Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong concentration bounds then we get the same high probability bounds without any need for repetitions. Instead of r independent sketches we have a single sketch that is r times bigger so the total space is the same. However we only apply a single hash function so we save a factor r in time and the overall algorithms just get simpler. Fast practical hash functions with strong concentration bounds were recently proposed by Aamand em et al. (to appear in STOC 2020). Using their hashing schemes the algorithms thus become very fast and practical suitable for online processing of high volume data streams.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in large-scale data space by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. However large-scale high-speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash learning field and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view hashing methods.</p>

In this paper we present a novel retrieval method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate accurate pairwise matches without costly redundancy. We formulate image retrieval task as a node binary classification problem in graph data a node is marked as positive if it shares the scene overlaps with the query image. The key idea is that we find that the local context in feature space around a query image contains rich information about the matchable relation between this image and its neighbors. By constructing a subgraph surrounding the query image as input data we adopt a learnable GCN to exploit whether nodes in the subgraph have overlapping regions with the query photograph. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs remarkably well on the challenging dataset of highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Besides compared with state-of-the-art matchable retrieval methods the proposed approach significantly reduces useless attempted matches without sacrificing the accuracy and completeness of reconstruction.</p>

	<td><p>All-pairs set similarity is a widely used data mining task even for large and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally similarity search has focused on discovering very similar pairs for which a variety of efficient algorithms are known. However recent work highlights the importance of finding pairs of sets with relatively small intersection sizes. For example in a recommender system two users may be alike even though their interests only overlap on a small percentage of items. In such systems some dimensions are often highly skewed because they are very popular. Together these two properties render previous approaches infeasible for large input sizes. To address this problem we present a new distributed algorithm LSF-Join for approximate all-pairs set similarity. The core of our algorithm is a randomized selection procedure based on Locality Sensitive Filtering. Our method deviates from prior approximate algorithms which are based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. Theoretically we show that LSF-Join efficiently finds most close pairs even for small similarity thresholds and for skewed input sets. We prove guarantees on the communication work and maximum load of LSF-Join and we also experimentally demonstrate its accuracy on multiple graphs.</p>

However FlyHash uses random projections and cannot learn from data. Building on inspiration from FlyHash and the ubiquity of sparse expansive representations in neurobiology our work proposes a novel hashing algorithm BioHash that produces sparse high dimensional hash codes in a data-driven manner. We show that BioHash outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing methods. Since our learning algorithm is based on a local and biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule our work provides evidence for the proposal that LSH might be a computational reason for the abundance of sparse expansive motifs in a variety of biological systems. We also propose a convolutional variant BioConvHash that further improves performance.

We compare a wide range of techniques and propose new ones from classical dimensionality reduction to more sophisticated distillation schemes.

As opposed to working with edit distance a vector similarity approach can be accelerated substantially using modern hardware or hashing techniques. Such an approach would require fixed-length embeddings for biological sequences. There has been recent interest in learning fixed-length protein embeddings using deep learning models under the hypothesis that the hidden layers of supervised or semi-supervised models could produce potentially useful vector embeddings. We consider transformer (BERT) protein language models that are pretrained on the TrEMBL data set and learn fixed-length embeddings on top of them with contextual lenses. The embeddings are trained to predict the family a protein belongs to for sequences in the Pfam database. We show that for nearest-neighbor family classification pretraining offers a noticeable boost in performance and that the corresponding learned embeddings are competitive with BLAST. Furthermore we show that the raw transformer embeddings obtained via static pooling do not perform well on nearest-neighbor family classification which suggests that learning embeddings in a supervised manner via contextual lenses may be a compute-efficient alternative to fine-tuning.</p>

	<td><p>Conventional unsupervised hashing methods usually take advantage of similarity graphs which are either pre-computed in the high-dimensional space or obtained from random anchor points. On the one hand existing methods uncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On the other hand graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce biased prior knowledge of data relevance leading to sub-optimal retrieval performance. In this paper we tackle the above problems by proposing an efficient and adaptive code-driven graph which is updated by decoding in the context of an auto-encoder. Specifically we introduce into our framework twin bottlenecks (i.e. latent variables) that exchange crucial information collaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e. binary codes) conveys the high-level intrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e. continuous variables for low-level detail information) which in turn propagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more discriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally rewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover the proposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating the binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods. Our source code can be found at httpsgithub.com/ymcidence/TBH.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing has been widely investigated recently for its efficiency in large-scale cross-media retrieval. However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods learn hash functions in a batch-based learning mode. Such mode is not suitable for large-scale data sets due to the large memory consumption and loses its efficiency when training streaming data. Online cross-modal hashing can deal with the above problems by learning hash model in an online learning process. However, existing online cross-modal hashing methods cannot update hash codes of old data by the newly learned model. In this paper, we propose Online Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (OCMFH) based on collective matrix factorization hashing (CMFH), which can adaptively update hash codes of old data according to dynamic changes of hash model without accessing to old data. Specifically, it learns discriminative hash codes for streaming data by collective matrix factorization in an online optimization scheme. Unlike conventional CMFH which needs to load the entire data points into memory, the proposed OCMFH retrains hash functions only by newly arriving data points. Meanwhile, it generates hash codes of new data and updates hash codes of old data by the latest updated hash model. In such way, hash codes of new data and old data are well-matched. Furthermore, a zero mean strategy is developed to solve the mean-varying problem in the online hash learning process. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMFH on online cross-media retrieval.</p>

However there are still some limitations to be further taken into account (1) most current CMH methods transform real-valued data points into discrete compact binary codes under the binary constraints limiting the capability of representation for original data on account of abundant loss of information and producing suboptimal hash codes; (2) the discrete binary constraint learning model is hard to solve where the retrieval performance may greatly reduce by relaxing the binary constraints for large quantization error; (3) handling the learning problem of CMH in a symmetric framework leading to difficult and complex optimization objective. To address above challenges in this paper a novel Asymmetric Correlation Quantization Hashing (ACQH) method is proposed. Specifically ACQH learns the projection matrixs of heterogeneous modalities data points for transforming query into a low-dimensional real-valued vector in latent semantic space and constructs the stacked compositional quantization embedding in a coarse-to-fine manner for indicating database points by a series of learnt real-valued codeword in the codebook with the help of pointwise label information regression simultaneously. Besides the unified hash codes across modalities can be directly obtained by the discrete iterative optimization framework devised in the paper. Comprehensive experiments on diverse three benchmark datasets have shown the effectiveness and rationality of ACQH.</p>

	<td><p>Modern image retrieval systems increasingly rely on the use of deep neural networks to learn embedding spaces in which distance encodes the relevance between a given query and image. In this setting existing approaches tend to emphasize one of two properties. Triplet-based methods capture top-k relevancy where all top-k scoring documents are assumed to be relevant to a given query Pairwise contrastive models capture threshold relevancy where all documents scoring higher than some threshold are assumed to be relevant. In this paper we propose Cross-Example Softmax which combines the properties of top-k and threshold relevancy. In each iteration the proposed loss encourages all queries to be closer to their matching images than all queries are to all non-matching images. This leads to a globally more calibrated similarity metric and makes distance more interpretable as an absolute measure of relevance. We further introduce Cross-Example Negative Mining in which each pair is compared to the hardest negative comparisons across the entire batch. Empirically we show in a series of experiments on Conceptual Captions and Flickr30k that the proposed method effectively improves global calibration and also retrieval performance.</p>

	<td><p>Triplet loss is widely used for learning local descriptors from image patch. However triplet loss only minimizes the Euclidean distance between matching descriptors and maximizes that between the non-matching descriptors which neglects the topology similarity between two descriptor sets. In this paper we propose topology measure besides Euclidean distance to learn topology consistent descriptors by considering kNN descriptors of positive sample. First we establish a novel topology vector for each descriptor followed by Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to indicate the topological relation among the descriptor and its kNN descriptors. Then we define topology distance between descriptors as the difference of their topology vectors. Last we employ the dynamic weighting strategy to fuse Euclidean distance and topology distance of matching descriptors and take the fusion result as the positive sample distance in the triplet loss. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our method performs better than state-of-the-arts results and effectively improves the performance of triplet loss.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing techniques have recently been successfully applied to solve similarity search problems in the information retrieval field because of their significantly reduced storage and high-speed search capabilities. However, the hash codes learned from most recent cross-modal hashing methods lack the ability to comprehensively preserve adequate information, resulting in a less than desirable performance. To solve this limitation, we propose a novel method termed Nonlinear Robust Discrete Hashing (NRDH), for cross-modal retrieval. The main idea behind NRDH is motivated by the success of neural networks, i.e., nonlinear descriptors, in the field of representation learning, and the use of nonlinear descriptors instead of simple linear transformations is more in line with the complex relationships that exist between common latent representation and heterogeneous multimedia data in the real world. In NRDH, we first learn a common latent representation through nonlinear descriptors to encode complementary and consistent information from the features of the heterogeneous multimedia data. Moreover, an asymmetric learning scheme is proposed to correlate the learned hash codes with the common latent representation. Empirically, we demonstrate that NRDH is able to successfully generate a comprehensive common latent representation that significantly improves the quality of the learned hash codes. Then, NRDH adopts a linear learning strategy to fast learn the hash function with the learned hash codes. Extensive experiments performed on two benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of NRDH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

As this new technology permeated through applications like bioinformatics the string collections experienced a growth that outperforms Moores Law and challenges our ability of handling them even in compressed form. It turns out fortunately that many of these rapidly growing string collections are highly repetitive so that their information content is orders of magnitude lower than their plain size. The statistical compression methods used for classical collections however are blind to this repetitiveness and therefore a new set of techniques has been developed in order to properly exploit it. The resulting indexes form a new generation of data structures able to handle the huge repetitive string collections that we are facing. In this survey we cover the algorithmic developments that have led to these data structures. We describe the distinct compression paradigms that have been used to exploit repetitiveness the fundamental algorithmic ideas that form the base of all the existing indexes and the various structures that have been proposed comparing them both in theoretical and practical aspects. We conclude with the current challenges in this fascinating field.</p>

	<td><p>Semantic hashing is an emerging technique for large-scale similarity search based on representing high-dimensional data using similarity-preserving binary codes used for efficient indexing and search. It has recently been shown that variational autoencoders with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by neural nets can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and unsupervised scenarios improving on more traditional methods thanks to their ability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However the scenario where labels are scarce has not been studied yet. This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on variational autoencoders to the lack of supervision focusing on two semi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational autoencoders training objective to jointly model the distribution over the data and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to define an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the similarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space. Our experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash codes quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number of labelled points is large. However we found that this method degrades quickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent this problem we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its label distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to the best baseline this procedure yields similar performance in fully supervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data is scarce. Our code is made publicly available at httpsgithub.com/amacaluso/SSB-VAE.</p>

Second we use cell phone images of sheet music as our input queries which lends itself to a practical user-facing application. We show that a previously proposed fingerprinting method for sheet music retrieval is far too slow for a real-time application and we diagnose its shortcomings. We propose a novel hashing scheme called dynamic n-gram fingerprinting that significantly reduces runtime while simultaneously boosting retrieval accuracy.

	<td><p>Image hash codes are produced by binarizing the embeddings of convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained for either classification or retrieval. While proxy embeddings achieve good performance on both tasks they are non-trivial to binarize due to a rotational ambiguity that encourages non-binary embeddings. The use of a fixed set of proxies (weights of the CNN classification layer) is proposed to eliminate this ambiguity and a procedure to design proxy sets that are nearly optimal for both classification and hashing is introduced. The resulting hash-consistent large margin (HCLM) proxies are shown to encourage saturation of hashing units thus guaranteeing a small binarization error while producing highly discriminative hash-codes. A semantic extension (sHCLM) aimed to improve hashing performance in a transfer scenario is also proposed. Extensive experiments show that sHCLM embeddings achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art hashing procedures on several small and large datasets both within and beyond the set of training classes.</p>

We show how we can append the LSH algorithm with heavy hitters sketches to provably solve the (high) similarity search problem without a single distance computation. Overall we mathematically show that under realistic data assumptions we can identify the near-neighbor of a given query q in sub-linear ( ll O(n)) number of simple sketch aggregation operations only. To make such a system practical we offer a novel design and sketching solution to reduce the inter-machine communication overheads exponentially.

PySpark is a widely-adopted distributed implementation of the LSH algorithm for large datasets and is deployed in commercial platforms.

Learning visual-semantic representations from images is a well studied problem for image retrieval. Filtering based on image concepts or attributes is traditionally achieved with index-based filtering (e.g. on textual tags) or by re-ranking after an initial visual embedding based retrieval. In this paper we learn a joint vision and concept embedding in the same high-dimensional space. This joint model gives the user fine-grained control over the semantics of the result set allowing them to explore the catalog of images more rapidly. We model the visual and concept relationships as a graph structure which captures the rich information through node neighborhood. This graph structure helps us learn multi-modal node embeddings using Graph Neural Networks. We also introduce a novel inference time control based on selective neighborhood connectivity allowing the user control over the retrieval algorithm. We evaluate these multi-modal embeddings quantitatively on the downstream relevance task of image retrieval on MS-COCO dataset and qualitatively on MS-COCO and an Adobe Stock dataset.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal retrieval deals with retrieving relevant items from one modality when provided with a search query from another modality. Hashing techniques where the data is represented as binary bits have specifically gained importance due to the ease of storage fast computations and high accuracy. In real world the number of data categories is continuously increasing which requires algorithms capable of handling this dynamic scenario. In this work we propose a novel incremental cross-modal hashing algorithm termed iCMH which can adapt itself to handle incoming data of new categories. The proposed approach consists of two sequential stages namely learning the hash codes and training the hash functions. At every stage a small amount of old category data termed exemplars is is used so as not to forget the old data while trying to learn for the new incoming data i.e. to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In the first stage the hash codes for the exemplars is used and simultaneously hash codes for the new data is computed such that it maintains the semantic relations with the existing data. For the second stage we propose both a non-deep and deep architectures to learn the hash functions effectively. Extensive experiments across a variety of cross-modal datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art cross-modal algorithms shows the usefulness of our approach.</p>

The usual procedure is to extract some useful features from the query image and retrieve images which have similar set of features. For this purpose a suitable similarity measure is chosen and images with high similarity scores are retrieved. Naturally the choice of these features play a very important role in the success of this system and high level features are required to reduce the semantic gap. In this paper we propose to use features derived from pre-trained network models from a deep-learning convolution network trained for a large image classification problem. This approach appears to produce vastly superior results for a variety of databases and it outperforms many contemporary CBIR systems.

	<td><p>Due to their high retrieval efficiency and low storage cost for cross-modal search task cross-modal hashing methods have attracted considerable attention. For the supervised cross-modal hashing methods how to make the learned hash codes preserve semantic information sufficiently contained in the label of datapoints is the key to further enhance the retrieval performance. Hence almost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depends on defining a similarity between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing model learning fully or partly. However the defined similarity between datapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and misses abundant semantic information then hinders the further improvement of retrieval performance. Thus in this paper different from previous works we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity between datapoints called Deep Cross-modal Hashing via (DCHML). Specifically DCHML first trains a proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset into a semantic discriminative hash code called proxy hash code. Each proxy hash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category well. Next without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the training process of the modality-specific hashing networks we propose a novel to directly utilize the proxy hashing codes as supervised information. Finally by minimizing the novel the modality-specific hashing networks can be trained to generate hash codes which can simultaneously preserve the cross-modal similarity and abundant semantic information well.</p>

	<td><p>Recent models for cross-modal retrieval have benefited from an increasingly rich understanding of visual scenes afforded by scene graphs and object interactions to mention a few. This has resulted in an improved matching between the visual representation of an image and the textual representation of its caption. Yet current visual representations overlook a key aspect the text appearing in images which may contain crucial information for retrieval. In this paper we first propose a new dataset that allows exploration of cross-modal retrieval where images contain scene-text instances. Then armed with this dataset we describe several approaches which leverage scene text including a better scene-text aware cross-modal retrieval method which uses specialized representations for text from the captions and text from the visual scene and reconcile them in a common embedding space. Extensive experiments confirm that cross-modal retrieval approaches benefit from scene text and highlight interesting research questions worth exploring further.

	<td><p>Deep representation learning has become one of the most widely adopted approaches for visual search recommendation and identification. Retrieval of such representations from a large database is however computationally challenging. Approximate methods based on learning compact representations have been widely explored for this problem such as locality sensitive hashing product quantization and PCA. In this work in contrast to learning compact representations we propose to learn high dimensional and sparse representations that have similar representational capacity as dense embeddings while being more efficient due to sparse matrix multiplication operations which can be much faster than dense multiplication. Following the key insight that the number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of embeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across dimensions we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse embeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that directly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval. Our experiments show that our approach is competitive to the other baselines and yields a similar or better speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff on practical datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Recently hashing is widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for its storage and computational efficiency. Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity-preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre-trained model as the guiding information i.e. treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre-trained model many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover few of the methods consider the robustness of models which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper we propose a new method named omprehensive smilarity ining and cnsistency learing (CIMON). First we use global refinement and similarity statistical distribution to obtain reliable and smooth guidance. Second both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb-invariant and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval performance and robustness.</p>

In this survey we detailedly investigate current deep hashing algorithms including deep supervised hashing and deep unsupervised hashing. Specifically we categorize deep supervised hashing methods into pairwise methods ranking-based methods pointwise methods as well as quantization according to how measuring the similarities of the learned hash codes. Moreover deep unsupervised hashing is categorized into similarity reconstruction-based methods pseudo-label-based methods and prediction-free self-supervised learning-based methods based on their semantic learning manners. We also introduce three related important topics including semi-supervised deep hashing domain adaption deep hashing and multi-modal deep hashing.

	<td><p>We propose an efficient pipeline for large-scale landmark image retrieval that addresses the diversity of the dataset through two-stage discriminative re-ranking. Our approach is based on embedding the images in a feature-space using a convolutional neural network trained with a cosine softmax loss. Due to the variance of the images which include extreme viewpoint changes such as having to retrieve images of the exterior of a landmark from images of the interior this is very challenging for approaches based exclusively on visual similarity. Our proposed re-ranking approach improves the results in two steps in the sort-step k-nearest neighbor search with soft-voting to sort the retrieved results based on their label similarity to the query images and in the insert-step we add additional samples from the dataset that were not retrieved by image-similarity. This approach allows overcoming the low visual diversity in retrieved images. In-depth experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing approaches on the challenging Google Landmarks Datasets. Using our methods we achieved 1st place in the Google Landmark Retrieval 2019 challenge and 3rd place in the Google Landmark Recognition 2019 challenge on Kaggle.

	<td><p>In recent years, cross-media retrieval has drawn considerable attention due to the exponential growth of multimedia data. Many hashing approaches have been proposed for the cross-media search task. However, there are still open problems that warrant investigation. For example, most existing supervised hashing approaches employ a binary label matrix, which achieves small margins between wrong labels (0) and true labels (1). This may affect the retrieval performance by generating many false negatives and false positives. In addition, some methods adopt a relaxation scheme to solve the binary constraints, which may cause large quantization errors. There are also some discrete hashing methods that have been presented, but most of them are time-consuming. To conquer these problems, we present a label relaxation and discrete matrix factorization method (LRMF) for cross-modal retrieval. It offers a number of innovations. First of all, the proposed approach employs a novel label relaxation scheme to control the margins adaptively, which has the benefit of reducing the quantization error. Second, by virtue of the proposed discrete matrix factorization method designed to learn the binary codes, large quantization errors caused by relaxation can be avoided. The experimental results obtained on two widely-used databases demonstrate that LRMF outperforms state-of-the-art cross-media methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has attracted widespread attention in image retrieval because of its fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Compared with supervised methods, unsupervised hashing methods are more reasonable and suitable for large-scale image retrieval since it is always difficult and expensive to collect true labels of the massive data. Without label information, however, unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH), which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part, we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part, a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore, the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes, hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. To solve the resulting optimization problem, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based iterative algorithm is elaborately designed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale data sets indicate the promising performance of the proposed LSAH.</p>

	<td><p>Given a CNF formula F on n variables the problem of model counting or SAT is to compute the number of satisfying assignments of F . Model counting is a fundamental but hard problem in computer science with varied applications. Recent years have witnessed a surge of effort towards developing efficient algorithmic techniques that combine the classical 2-universal hashing with the remarkable progress in SAT solving over the past decade. These techniques augment the CNF formula F with random XOR constraints and invoke an NP oracle repeatedly on the resultant CNF-XOR formulas. In practice calls to the NP oracle calls are replaced a SAT solver whose runtime performance is adversely affected by size of XOR constraints. The standard construction of 2-universal hash functions chooses every variable with probability p = 1/2 leading to XOR constraints of size n/2 in expectation. Consequently the challenge is to design sparse hash functions where variables can be chosen with smaller probability and lead to smaller sized XOR constraints. In this paper we address this challenge from theoretical and practical perspectives. First we formalize a relaxation of universal hashing called concentrated hashing and establish a novel and beautiful connection between concentration measures of these hash functions and isoperimetric inequalities on boolean hypercubes. This allows us to obtain (log m) tight bounds on variance and dispersion index and show that p = O( log(m)/m ) suffices for design of sparse hash functions from 0 1^n to 0 1^m. We then use sparse hash functions belonging to this concentrated hash family to develop new approximate counting algorithms. A comprehensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on 1893 benchmarks demonstrates that usage of sparse hash functions can lead to significant speedups.</p>

Generally compared with shallow cross-modal hashing methods deep cross-modal hashing methods can achieve a more satisfactory performance by integrating feature learning and hash codes optimizing into a same framework. However most existing deep cross-modal hashing methods either cannot learn a unified hash code for the two correlated data-points of different modalities in a database instance or cannot guide the learning of unified hash codes by the feedback of hashing function learning procedure to enhance the retrieval accuracy. To address the issues above in this paper we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Cross-Modal Hashing with Hashing Functions and Unified Hash Codes Jointly Learning (DCHUC). Specifically by an iterative optimization algorithm DCHUC jointly learns unified hash codes for image-text pairs in a database and a pair of hash functions for unseen query image-text pairs. With the iterative optimization algorithm the learned unified hash codes can be used to guide the hashing function learning procedure; Meanwhile the learned hashing functions can feedback to guide the unified hash codes optimizing procedure.

In this paper we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space.

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale data retrieval in many domains due to its low storage cost and high retrieval speed. Existing cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence between training samples across modalities are readily available. This assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition these methods generally require the same number of samples across different modalities which restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact of an incomplete correspondence it jointly optimizes in a unified objective function the potential correspondence the cross-modal hashing functions derived from the correspondence and a hashing quantitative loss. An alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the correspondence and hash functions and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of the two objectives. Experiments on publicly multi-modal datasets show that FlexCMH achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods and it indeed offers a high degree of flexibility for practical cross-modal hashing tasks.</p>

To obtain better accuracy, linear-based hashing methods focus on designing a generalized linear objective function with different constraints or penalty terms that consider neighborhood information. In this study, we propose a novel generalized framework called Model Boost (MoBoost), which can achieve the self-improvement of the linear-based hashing. The proposed MoBoost is used to improve model parameter optimization for linear-based hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed MoBoost, given a linear-based hashing method, we first execute the method several times to get several different hash codes for training samples, and then combine these different hash codes into one set utilizing one novel fusion strategy. Based on this set of hash codes, we learn some new parameters for the linear hash function that can significantly improve accuracy. The proposed MoBoost can be generally adopted in existing linear-based hashing methods, achieving more precise and stable performance compared to the original methods while imposing negligible added expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments are performed based on three benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing establishes efficient and effective image retrieval by end-to-end learning of deep representations and hash codes from similarity data. We present a compact coding solution focusing on deep learning to quantization approach that has shown superior performance over hashing solutions for similarity retrieval. We propose Deep Triplet Quantization (DTQ) a novel approach to learning deep quantization models from the similarity triplets. To enable more effective triplet training we design a new triplet selection approach Group Hard that randomly selects hard triplets in each image group. To generate compact binary codes we further apply a triplet quantization with weak orthogonality during triplet training. The quantization loss reduces the codebook redundancy and enhances the quantizability of deep representations through back-propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTQ can generate high-quality and compact binary codes which yields state-of-the-art image retrieval performance on three benchmark datasets NUS-WIDE CIFAR-10 and MS-COCO.</p>

	<td><p>Label information is widely used in hashing methods because of its effectiveness of improving the precision. The existing hashing methods always use two different projections to represent the mutual regression between hash codes and class labels. In contrast to the existing methods we propose a novel learning-based hashing method termed stable supervised discrete hashing with mutual linear regression (S2DHMLR) in this study where only one stable projection is used to describe the linear correlation between hash codes and corresponding labels. To the best of our knowledge this strategy has not been used for hashing previously. In addition we further use a boosting strategy to improve the final performance of the proposed method without adding extra constraints and with little extra expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments conducted on three image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely studied for big data retrieval due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) aims to learn a hashing model that is trained using only samples from seen categories but can generalize well to samples of unseen categories. ZSH generally uses category attributes to seek a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen categories to unseen ones. As a result it may perform poorly when labeled data are insufficient. ZSH methods are mainly designed for single-modality data which prevents their application to the widely spread multi-modal data. On the other hand existing cross-modal hashing solutions assume that all the modalities share the same category labels while in practice the labels of different data modalities may be different. To address these issues we propose a general Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing (CZHash) solution to effectively leverage unlabeled and labeled multi-modality data with different label spaces. CZHash first quantifies the composite similarity between instances using label and feature information. It then defines an objective function to achieve deep feature learning compatible with the composite similarity preserving category attribute space learning and hashing coding function learning. CZHash further introduces an alternative optimization procedure to jointly optimize these learning objectives. Experiments on benchmark multi-modal datasets show that CZHash significantly outperforms related representative hashing approaches both on effectiveness and adaptability.</p>

	<td><p>Recently learning to hash has been widely studied for image retrieval thanks to the computation and storage efficiency of binary codes. For most existing learning to hash methods sufficient training images are required and used to learn precise hashing codes. However in some real-world applications there are not always sufficient training images in the domain of interest. In addition some existing supervised approaches need a amount of labeled data which is an expensive process in term of time label and human expertise. To handle such problems inspired by transfer learning we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing method named Optimal Projection Guided Transfer Hashing (GTH) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain i.e. source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of interest i.e. target domain. Besides we propose to seek for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) solution of the hashing functions of target and source domains due to the domain gap. Furthermorean alternating optimization method is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains such that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually. Extensive experiments on various benchmark databases verify that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art learning to hash methods.

	<td><p>Hash based nearest neighbor search has become attractive in many applications. However the quantization in hashing usually degenerates the discriminative power when using Hamming distance ranking. Besides for large-scale visual search existing hashing methods cannot directly support the efficient search over the data with multiple sources and while the literature has shown that adaptively incorporating complementary information from diverse sources or views can significantly boost the search performance. To address the problems this paper proposes a novel and generic approach to building multiple hash tables with multiple views and generating fine-grained ranking results at bitwise and tablewise levels. For each hash table a query-adaptive bitwise weighting is introduced to alleviate the quantization loss by simultaneously exploiting the quality of hash functions and their complement for nearest neighbor search. From the tablewise aspect multiple hash tables are built for different data views as a joint index over which a query-specific rank fusion is proposed to rerank all results from the bitwise ranking by diffusing in a graph. Comprehensive experiments on image search over three well-known benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves up to 17.11 and 20.28 performance gains on single and multiple table search over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Most online hashing methods learning binary codes based on pairwise similarities of training instances fail to capture the semantic relationship and suffer from a poor generalization in large-scale applications due to large variations. In this paper we propose to model the similarity distributions between the input data and the hashing codes upon which a novel supervised online hashing method dubbed as Similarity Distribution based Online Hashing (SDOH) is proposed to keep the intrinsic semantic relationship in the produced Hamming space. Specifically we first transform the discrete similarity matrix into a probability matrix via a Gaussian-based normalization to address the extremely imbalanced distribution issue. And then we introduce a scaling Student t-distribution to solve the challenging initialization problem and efficiently bridge the gap between the known and unknown distributions. Lastly we align the two distributions via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-diverence) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by which an intuitive similarity constraint is imposed to update hashing model on the new streaming data with a powerful generalizing ability to the past data. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed SDOH over the state-of-the-art methods in the online retrieval task.</p>

	<td><p>Online image hashing has attracted increasing research attention recently which receives large-scale data in a streaming manner to update the hash functions on-the-fly. Its key challenge lies in the difficulty of balancing the learning timeliness and model accuracy. To this end most works follow a supervised setting i.e. using class labels to boost the hashing performance which defects in two aspects First strong constraints e.g. orthogonal or similarity preserving are used which however are typically relaxed and lead to large accuracy drop. Second large amounts of training batches are required to learn the up-to-date hash functions which largely increase the learning complexity. To handle the above challenges a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed Hadamard Matrix Guided Online Hashing (HMOH) is proposed in this paper. Our key innovation lies in introducing Hadamard matrix which is an orthogonal binary matrix built via Sylvester method. In particular to release the need of strong constraints we regard each column of Hadamard matrix as the target code for each class label which by nature satisfies several desired properties of hashing codes. To accelerate the online training LSH is first adopted to align the lengths of target code and to-be-learned binary code. We then treat the learning of hash functions as a set of binary classification problems to fit the assigned target code. Finally extensive experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method over various state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at httpsgithub.com/lmbxmu/mycode.</p>

	<td><p>When facing large-scale image datasets online hashing serves as a promising solution for online retrieval and prediction tasks. It encodes the online streaming data into compact binary codes and simultaneously updates the hash functions to renew codes of the existing dataset. To this end the existing methods update hash functions solely based on the new data batch without investigating the correlation between such new data and the existing dataset. In addition existing works update the hash functions using a relaxation process in its corresponding approximated continuous space. And it remains as an open problem to directly apply discrete optimizations in online hashing. In this paper we propose a novel supervised online hashing method termed Balanced Similarity for Online Discrete Hashing (BSODH) to solve the above problems in a unified framework. BSODH employs a well-designed hashing algorithm to preserve the similarity between the streaming data and the existing dataset via an asymmetric graph regularization. We further identify the data-imbalance problem brought by the constructed asymmetric graph which restricts the application of discrete optimization in our problem. Therefore a novel balanced similarity is further proposed which uses two equilibrium factors to balance the similar and dissimilar weights and eventually enables the usage of discrete optimizations. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

However there exists an ambiguity problem that lots of binary codes share the same Hamming distance to a query. To alleviate the ambiguity problem weighted binary codes assign different weights to each bit of binary codes and compare the binary codes by the weighted Hamming distance. Till now performing the querying from the weighted binary codes efficiently is still an open issue. In this paper we propose a new method to rank the weighted binary codes and return the nearest weighted binary codes of the query efficiently. In our method based on the multi-index hash tables two algorithms the table bucket finding algorithm and the table merging algorithm are proposed to select the nearest weighted binary codes of the query in a non-exhaustive and accurate way. The proposed algorithms are justified by proving their theoretic properties. The experiments on three large-scale datasets validate both the search efficiency and the search accuracy of our method.

Most existing methods adopt spatially invariant bit length allocation and incorporate discrete entropy approximation to constrain compression rate. Nonetheless the information content is spatially variant where the regions with complex and salient structures generally are more essential to image compression. Taking the spatial variation of image content into account this paper presents a content-weighted encoder-decoder model which involves an importance map subnet to produce the importance mask for locally adaptive bit rate allocation. Consequently the summation of importance mask can thus be utilized as an alternative of entropy estimation for compression rate control. Furthermore the quantized representations of the learned code and importance map are still spatially dependent which can be losslessly compressed using arithmetic coding. To compress the codes effectively and efficiently we propose a trimmed convolutional network to predict the conditional probability of quantized codes. Experiments show that the proposed method can produce visually much better results and performs favorably in comparison with deep and traditional lossy image compression approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Traditional person re-identification (ReID) methods typically represent person images as real-valued features which makes ReID inefficient when the gallery set is extremely large. Recently some hashing methods have been proposed to make ReID more efficient. However these hashing methods will deteriorate the accuracy in general and the efficiency of them is still not high enough. In this paper we propose a novel hashing method called deep multi-index hashing (DMIH) to improve both efficiency and accuracy for ReID. DMIH seamlessly integrates multi-index hashing and multi-branch based networks into the same framework. Furthermore a novel block-wise multi-index hashing table construction approach and a search-aware multi-index (SAMI) loss are proposed in DMIH to improve the search efficiency. Experiments on three widely used datasets show that DMIH can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines including both hashing methods and real-valued methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

	<td><p>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels which we call unseen images zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper for the first time a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data. Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the competing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Driven by the urgent demand for managing remote sensing big data large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) attracts increasing attention in the remote sensing field. In general existing retrieval methods can be regarded as visual-based retrieval approaches which search and return a set of similar images from a database to a given query image. Although retrieval methods have achieved great success there is still a question that needs to be responded to Can we obtain the accurate semantic labels of the returned similar images to further help analyzing and processing imagery Inspired by the above question in this paper we redefine the image retrieval problem as visual and semantic retrieval of images. Specifically we propose a novel deep hashing convolutional neural network (DHCNN) to simultaneously retrieve the similar images and classify their semantic labels in a unified framework. In more detail a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract high-dimensional deep features. Then a hash layer is perfectly inserted into the network to transfer the deep features into compact hash codes. In addition a fully connected layer with a softmax function is performed on hash layer to generate class distribution. Finally a loss function is elaborately designed to simultaneously consider the label loss of each image and similarity loss of pairs of images. Experimental results on two remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-art retrieval and classification performance.</p>

This approach generalizes and interpolates between the fast but suboptimal hyperplane hashing of Charikar STOC02 and the asymptotically optimal but practically often slower hash families of Andoni-Indyk FOCS06 Andoni-Indyk-Nguyen-Razenshteyn SODA14 and Andoni-Indyk-Laarhoven-Razenshteyn-Schmidt NIPS15. We set up a framework for analyzing the performance of any spherical code in this context and we provide results for various codes from the literature such as those related to regular polytopes and root lattices. Similar to hyperplane hashing and unlike cross-polytope hashing our analysis of collision probabilities and query exponents is exact and does not hide order terms which vanish only for large d facilitating an easy parameter selection. For the two-dimensional case we derive closed-form expressions for arbitrary spherical codes and we show that the equilateral triangle is optimal achieving a better performance than the two-dimensional analogues of hyperplane and cross-polytope hashing. In three and four dimensions we numerically find that the tetrahedron 5-cell and 16-cell achieve the best query exponents while in five or more dimensions orthoplices appear to outperform regular simplices as well as the root lattice families A_k and D_k. We argue that in higher dimensions larger spherical codes will likely exist which will outperform orthoplices in theory and we argue why using the D_k root lattices will likely lead to better results in practice due to a better trade-off between the asymptotic query exponent and the concrete costs of hashing.</p>

	<td><p>While separate chaining is a common strategy for resolving collisions in a hash table taught in most textbooks compact hashing is a less common technique for saving space when hashing integers whose domain is relatively small with respect to the problem size. It is widely believed that hash tables waste a considerable amount of memory as they either leave allocated space untouched (open addressing) or store additional pointers (separate chaining). For the former Cleary introduced the compact hashing technique that stores only a part of a key to save space. However as can be seen by the line of research focusing on compact hash tables with open addressing there is additional information called displacement required for restoring a key. There are several representations of this displacement information with different space and time trade-offs. In this article we introduce a separate chaining hash table that applies the compact hashing technique without the need for the displacement information. Practical evaluations reveal that insertions in this hash table are faster or use less space than all previously known compact hash tables on modern computer architectures when storing sufficiently large satellite data.</p>

Our framework forces the representation of an image to be similar to the representation of the text that describes it.

The objective of video segment copy detection is to find the video (s) present in a large database one of whose segments (cropped in time) is a (transformed) copy of the given query video. This transformation may be temporal (for example frame dropping change in frame rate) or spatial (brightness and contrast change addition of noise etc.) in nature although the primary focus of this report is detecting temporal attacks. The video hashing method proposed by us uses a deep learning neural network to learn variable length binary hash codes for the entire video considering both temporal and spatial features into account. This is in contrast to most existing video hashing methods as they use conventional image hashing techniques to obtain hash codes for a video after extracting features for every frame or certain key frames in which case the temporal information present in the video is not exploited. Our hashing method is specifically resilient to time cropping making it extremely useful in video segment copy detection. Experimental results obtained on the large augmented dataset consisting of around 25000 videos with segment copies demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed video hashing method.</p>

Furthermore we found that most previous studies used small scale datasets to simplify processing. Because the behavior of a feature representation in a deep learning model depends on both domain and data it is important to understand how model behave in large-scale environments when a proper combination of retrieval tricks is used. In this paper we extensively analyze the effect of well-known pre-processing post-processing tricks and their combination for large-scale image retrieval.

The algorithm allows users of the table to skip or jump over irrelevant entries allowing quick search insertion and removal of entries. Unlike traditional linear probing Hopscotch Hashing is capable of operating under a high load factor as probe counts remain small. Our lock-free version improves on both speed cache locality and progress guarantees of the original being a chimera of two concurrent hash tables. We compare our data structure to various other lock-free and blocking hashing algorithms and show that its performance is in many cases superior to existing strategies. The proposed lock-free version overcomes some of the drawbacks associated with the original blocking version leading to a substantial boost in scalability while maintaining attractive features like physical deletion or probe-chain compression.</p>

Specifically we learn a neural network-based model which transforms the input representation into a binary representation. We formalize the training objective of the network in an intuitive and effective way considering each training sample as a query and aiming to obtain the same retrieval results using the produced hash codes as those obtained with the original features. This training formulation directly optimizes the hashing model for the target usage of the hash codes it produces. We further explore the addition of a decoder trained to obtain an approximated reconstruction of the original features. At test time we retrieved the most promising database samples with an efficient graph-based search procedure using only our hash codes and perform re-ranking using the reconstructed features thus without needing to access the original features at all. Experiments conducted on multiple publicly available large-scale datasets show that our method consistently outperforms all compared state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods and that the reconstruction procedure can effectively boost the search accuracy with a minimal constant additional cost.</p>

Contrary to this we propose an efficient deep supervised hashing algorithm that optimizes the learned codes using an information-theoretic measure the Quadratic Mutual Information (QMI). The proposed method is adapted to the needs of large-scale hashing and information retrieval leading to a novel information-theoretic measure the Quadratic Spherical Mutual Information (QSMI). Apart from demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method under different scenarios and outperforming existing state-of-the-art image hashing techniques this paper provides a structured way to model the process of information retrieval and develop novel methods adapted to the needs of each application.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the high storage and search efficiency, hashing
has become prevalent for large-scale similarity search. Particularly, deep hashing methods have greatly improved the
search performance under supervised scenarios. In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve
satisfactory performance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals.
 To address this issue, we propose
a novel deep unsupervised hashing model, dubbed DistillHash, which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data
pairs, which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial
noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and
the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal
classifier. We show that under a mild assumption, some
data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier, can be potentially
distilled. Inspired by this fact, we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further
adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the
proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the stateof-the-art search performance.</p>

In recent years various hashing methods based on deep neural networks have been proposed and achieved higher precision than the other hashing methods. In these methods multiple losses for hash codes and the parameters of neural networks are defined. They generate hash codes that minimize the weighted sum of the losses. Therefore an expert has to tune the weights for the losses heuristically and the probabilistic optimality of the loss function cannot be explained. In order to generate explainable hash codes without weight tuning we theoretically derive a single loss function with no hyperparameters for the hash code from the probability distribution of the images. By generating hash codes that minimize this loss function highly accurate image retrieval with probabilistic optimality is performed. We evaluate the performance of hashing using MNIST CIFAR-10 SVHN and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently randomly mapping vectorial data to strings of discrete symbols (i.e. sketches) for fast and space-efficient similarity searches has become popular. Such random mapping is called similarity-preserving hashing and approximates a similarity metric by using the Hamming distance. Although many efficient similarity searches have been proposed most of them are designed for binary sketches. Similarity searches on integer sketches are in their infancy. In this paper we present a novel space-efficient trie named b-bit sketch trie on integer sketches for scalable similarity searches by leveraging the idea behind succinct data structures (i.e. space-efficient data structures while supporting various data operations in the compressed format) and a favorable property of integer sketches as fixed-length strings. Our experimental results obtained using real-world datasets show that a trie-based index is built from integer sketches and efficiently performs similarity searches on the index by pruning useless portions of the search space which greatly improves the search time and space-efficiency of the similarity search. The experimental results show that our similarity search is at most one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art similarity searches. Besides our method needs only 10 GiB of memory on a billion-scale database while state-of-the-art similarity searches need 29 GiB of memory.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images first the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets.</p>

In this article we propose a novel deep semantic multimodal hashing network (DSMHN) for scalable image-text and video-text retrieval. The proposed deep hashing framework leverages 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the backbone network to capture the spatial information for image-text retrieval while the 3-D CNN as the backbone network to capture the spatial and temporal information for video-text retrieval. In the DSMHN two sets of modality-specific hash functions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both intermodality similarities and intramodality semantic labels. Specifically with the assumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for the classification task two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by embedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Moreover a unified deep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality hash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning intermodality similarity-preserving learning semantic label-preserving learning and hash function learning with different types of loss functions simultaneously. The proposed DSMHN method is a generic and scalable deep hashing framework for both image-text and video-text retrievals which can be flexibly integrated with different types of loss functions. We conduct extensive experiments for both single modal- and cross-modal-retrieval tasks on four widely used multimodal-retrieval data sets. Experimental results on both image-text- and video-text-retrieval tasks demonstrate that the DSMHN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing techniques also known as binary code learning have recently gained increasing attention in large-scale data analysis and storage. Generally most existing hash clustering methods are single-view ones which lack complete structure or complementary information from multiple views. For cluster tasks abundant prior researches mainly focus on learning discrete hash code while few works take original data structure into consideration. To address these problems we propose a novel binary code algorithm for clustering which adopts graph embedding to preserve the original data structure called (Graph-based Multi-view Binary Learning) GMBL in this paper. GMBL mainly focuses on encoding the information of multiple views into a compact binary code which explores complementary information from multiple views. In particular in order to maintain the graph-based structure of the original data we adopt a Laplacian matrix to preserve the local linear relationship of the data and map it to the Hamming space. Considering different views have distinctive contributions to the final clustering results GMBL adopts a strategy of automatically assign weights for each view to better guide the clustering. Finally An alternating iterative optimization method is adopted to optimize discrete binary codes directly instead of relaxing the binary constraint in two steps. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with previous approaches in terms of clustering performance.</p>

Bucket search also called hash lookup can achieve fast query speed with a sub-linear time cost based on the inverted index table constructed from hash codes. Many metrics have been adopted to evaluate hashing algorithms. However all existing metrics are improper to evaluate the hash codes for bucket search. On one hand all existing metrics ignore the retrieval time cost which is an important factor reflecting the performance of search. On the other hand some of them such as mean average precision (MAP) suffer from the uncertainty problem as the ranked list is based on integer-valued Hamming distance and are insensitive to Hamming radius as these metrics only depend on relative Hamming distance. Other metrics such as precision at Hamming radius R fail to evaluate global performance as these metrics only depend on one specific Hamming radius. In this paper we first point out the problems of existing metrics which have been ignored by the hashing community and then propose a novel evaluation metric called radius aware mean average precision (RAMAP) to evaluate hash codes for bucket search. Furthermore two coding strategies are also proposed to qualitatively show the problems of existing metrics. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed RAMAP can provide more proper evaluation than existing metrics.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing enables computation and memory efficient
image search through end-to-end learning of feature representations and binary codes. While linear scan over binary
hash codes is more efficient than over the high-dimensional
representations, its linear-time complexity is still unacceptable for very large databases. Hamming space retrieval enables constant-time search through hash lookups, where for
each query, there is a Hamming ball centered at the query
and the data points within the ball are returned as relevant.
Since inside the Hamming ball implies retrievable while
outside irretrievable, it is crucial to explicitly characterize
the Hamming ball. The main idea of this work is to directly
embody the Hamming radius into the loss functions, leading
to Maximum-Margin Hamming Hashing (MMHH), a new
model specifically optimized for Hamming space retrieval.
We introduce a max-margin t-distribution loss, where the
t-distribution concentrates more similar data points to be
within the Hamming ball, and the margin characterizes the
Hamming radius such that less penalization is applied to
similar data points within the Hamming ball. The loss function also introduces robustness to data noise, where the similarity supervision may be inaccurate in practical problems.
The model is trained end-to-end using a new semi-batch optimization algorithm tailored to extremely imbalanced data.
Our method yields state-of-the-art results on four datasets
and shows superior performance on noisy data.</p>

Locality Sensitive Hashing is one of the most popular approximate processing techniques for finding similar points in high-dimensional spaces. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants are designed to find similar points but they are not designed to find objects (such as images which are made up of a collection of points) efficiently. In this paper we propose an index structure Bitmap-Image LSH (bImageLSH) for efficient processing of high-dimensional images. Using a real dataset we experimentally show the performance benefit of our novel design while keeping the accuracy of the image results high.</p>

	<td><p>Existing deep hashing approaches fail to fully explore semantic correlations and neglect the effect of linguistic context on visual attention learning leading to inferior performance. This paper proposes a dual-stream learning framework dubbed Deep Collaborative Discrete Hashing (DCDH) which constructs a discriminative common discrete space by collaboratively incorporating the shared and individual semantics deduced from visual features and semantic labels. Specifically the context-aware representations are generated by employing the outer product of visual embeddings and semantic encodings. Moreover we reconstruct the labels and introduce the focal loss to take advantage of frequent and rare concepts. The common binary code space is built on the joint learning of the visual representations attended by language the semantic-invariant structure construction and the label distribution correction.

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of learning to hash in fast large-scale image retrieval. As deep learning has shown its superior performance on many computer vision applications, recent designs of learning-based hashing models have been moving from shallow ones to deep architectures. However, based on our analysis, we find that gradient descent based algorithms used in deep hashing models would potentially cause hash codes of a pair of training instances to be updated towards the directions of each other simultaneously during optimization. In the worst case, the paired hash codes switch their directions after update, and consequently, their corresponding distance in the Hamming space remain unchanged. This makes the overall learning process highly inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a new deep hashing model integrated with a novel gradient attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm is able to accelerate the learning process and obtain competitive retrieval performance compared with state-of-the-art deep hashing models.</p>

A number of deep metric learning methods which ensure that similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss functions and have shown promising results. In this paper different from the approaches on learning the loss structures we propose a robust SNR distance metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory we analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic similarity between image pairs which well justify its suitability for deep metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric our SNR distance metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks including CARS196 CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10 our DSML has shown its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally we extend our SNR distance metric to deep hashing learning and conduct experiments on two benchmarks including CIFAR10 and NUS-WIDE to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our SNR distance metric.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing, due to its low storage cost and high query speed, has been successfully used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications. It projects high-dimensional data into a shared isomorphic Hamming space with similar binary codes for semantically-similar data. In some applications, all modalities may not be obtained or trained simultaneously for some reasons, such as privacy, secret, storage limitation, and computational resource limitation. However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods need all modalities to jointly learn the common Hamming space, thus hindering them from handling these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Separated Variational Hashing Networks (SVHNs) to overcome the above challenge. Firstly, it adopts a label network (LabNet) to exploit available and nonspecific label annotations to learn a latent common Hamming space by projecting each semantic label into a common binary representation. Then, each modality-specific network can separately map the samples of the corresponding modality into their binary semantic codes learned by LabNet. We achieve it by conducting variational inference to match the aggregated posterior of the hashing code of LabNet with an arbitrary prior distribution. The effectiveness and efficiency of our SVHNs are verified by extensive experiments carried out on four widely-used multimedia databases, in comparison with 11 state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Retrieving videos of a particular person with face image as a query via hashing technique has many important applications. While face images are typically represented as vectors in Euclidean space characterizing face videos with some robust set modeling techniques (e.g. covariance matrices as exploited in this study which reside on Riemannian manifold) has recently shown appealing advantages. This hence results in a thorny heterogeneous spaces matching problem. Moreover hashing with handcrafted features as done in many existing works is clearly inadequate to achieve desirable performance for this task. To address such problems we present an end-to-end Deep Heterogeneous Hashing (DHH) method that integrates three stages including image feature learning video modeling and heterogeneous hashing in a single framework to learn unified binary codes for both face images and videos. To tackle the key challenge of hashing on the manifold a well-studied Riemannian kernel mapping is employed to project data (i.e. covariance matrices) into Euclidean space and thus enables to embed the two heterogeneous representations into a common Hamming space where both intra-space discriminability and inter-space compatibility are considered. To perform network optimization the gradient of the kernel mapping is innovatively derived via structured matrix backpropagation in a theoretically principled way. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method achieves quite competitive performance compared with existing hashing methods.</p>

In this paper a method is presented for image retrieval based on a combination of local texture information derived from two different texture descriptors. First the color channels of the input image are separated. The texture information is extracted using two descriptors such as evaluated local binary patterns and predefined pattern units. After extracting the features the similarity matching is done based on distance criteria.

<p>Cross-modal hashing encodes the multimedia data into a common binary hash space in which the correlations among the samples from different modalities can be effectively measured. Deep cross-modal hashing further improves the retrieval performance as the deep neural networks can generate more semantic relevant features and hash codes. In this paper, we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash coding and propose Deep Joint Semantics Reconstructing Hashing (DJSRH), which has the following two main advantages. First, to learn binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure of the original data, DJSRH constructs a novel joint-semantics affinity matrix which elaborately integrates the original neighborhood information from different modalities and accordingly is capable to capture the latent intrinsic semantic affinity for the input multi-modal instances. Second, DJSRH later trains the networks to generate binary codes that maximally reconstruct above joint-semantics relations via the proposed reconstructing framework, which is more competent for the batch-wise training as it reconstructs the specific similarity value unlike the common Laplacian constraint merely preserving the similarity order. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement by DJSRH in various cross-modal retrieval tasks.</p>

In this work we propose a new similarity metric termed as with which the hash codes of similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept i.e. that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally we propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval performance i.e. 3-20 in mAP over the previous state-of-the-arts.

However these methods have limited ability for fine-grained image retrieval because the semantic features extracted from the high layer are difficult in capturing the subtle differences. To this end we propose a novel two-pyramid hashing architecture to learn both the semantic information and the subtle appearance details for fine-grained image search. Inspired by the feature pyramids of convolutional neural network a vertical pyramid is proposed to capture the high-layer features and a horizontal pyramid combines multiple low-layer features with structural information to capture the subtle differences. To fuse the low-level features a novel combination strategy called consensus fusion is proposed to capture all subtle information from several low-layers for finer retrieval. Extensive evaluation on two fine-grained datasets CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the state-of-art baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes. Recent advances in this area have been obtained through neural network based models generative models trained by learning to reconstruct the original documents. We present a novel unsupervised generative semantic hashing approach (RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component. Similarly to variational autoencoders the variational component is trained to reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code and as in prior work it only considers documents individually. The ranking component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity into the hash code generation modelling document ranking through a hinge loss. To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss we use a weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised. Extensive experimental evaluation on four publicly available datasets against traditional baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods for semantic hashing shows that RBSH significantly outperforms all other methods across all evaluated hash code lengths. In fact RBSH hash codes are able to perform similarly to state-of-the-art hash codes while using 2-4x fewer bits.</p>

	<td><p>The problem of cross-modal similarity search, which aims at making efficient and accurate queries across multiple domains, has become a significant and important research topic. Composite quantization, a compact coding solution superior to hashing techniques, has shown its effectiveness for similarity search. However, most existing works utilizing composite quantization to search multi-domain content only consider either pairwise similarity information or class label information across different domains, which fails to tackle the semi-supervised problem in composite quantization. In this paper, we address the semi-supervised quantization problem by considering: (i) pairwise similarity information (without class label information) across different domains, which captures the intra-document relation, (ii) cross-domain data with class label which can help capture inter-document relation, and (iii) cross-domain data with neither pairwise similarity nor class label which enables the full use of abundant unlabelled information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both supervised information (pairwise similarity + class label) and unsupervised information (neither pairwise similarity nor class label) simultaneously in composite quantization. A challenging problem arises: how can we jointly handle these three sorts of information across multiple domains in an efficient way? To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep quantization (SSDQ) model that takes both supervised and unsupervised information into account. The proposed SSDQ model is capable of incorporating the above three kinds of information into one single framework when utilizing composite quantization for accurate and efficient queries across different domains. More specifically, we employ a modified deep autoencoder for better latent representation and formulate pairwise similarity loss, supervised quantization loss as well as unsupervised distribution match loss to handle all three types of information. The extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement of SSDQ over several state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</p>

	<td><p>With explosive growth of data volume and ever-increasing diversity of data modalities cross-modal similarity search which conducts nearest neighbor search across different modalities has been attracting increasing interest. This paper presents a deep compact code learning solution for efficient cross-modal similarity search. Many recent studies have proven that quantization-based approaches perform generally better than hashing-based approaches on single-modal similarity search. In this paper we propose a deep quantization approach which is among the early attempts of leveraging deep neural networks into quantization-based cross-modal similarity search. Our approach dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ) explicitly formulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private subspaces for individual modalities and representations in the shared subspace and the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embedding of different modality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition in the shared subspace a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact codes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network architecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training SPDQ can preserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly reduce quantization error. Experiments on two popular benchmarks corroborate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel learning-based hashing method called Supervised Discrete Hashing with Relaxation (SDHR) based on Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH). SDH uses ordinary least squares regression and traditional zero-one matrix encoding of class label information as the regression target (code words) thus fixing the regression target. In SDHR the regression target is instead optimized. The optimized regression target matrix satisfies a large margin constraint for correct classification of each example. Compared with SDH which uses the traditional zero-one matrix SDHR utilizes the learned regression target matrix and therefore more accurately measures the classification error of the regression model and is more flexible. As expected SDHR generally outperforms SDH. Experimental results on two large-scale image datasets (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) and a large-scale and challenging face dataset (FRGC) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SDHR.</p>

In this paper we propose a new learning-based hashing method called</code>fast supervised discrete hashing (FSDH) based on ``supervised discrete hashing (SDH). Regressing the training examples (or hash code) to the corresponding class labels is widely used in ordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method FSDH uses a very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples to the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems with the most critical sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC) which is time-consuming. However FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than iterative hash code-solving step which is highly efficient. Furthermore FSDH is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares regression making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example our results show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base and FSDH is about 151-times faster than FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base. Our experimental results show that FSDH is not only fast but also outperforms other comparative methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hash tables are ubiquitous and used in a wide range of applications for efficient probing of large and unsorted data. If designed properly hash-tables can enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly referred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes less structured (as is common for big-data applications) the need for efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce HashGraph a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts taken from sparse graph representationsâhence the name HashGraph. We show two different variants of HashGraph a simple algorithm that outlines the method to create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use open-addressing or chaining yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph currently works for static inputs though recent progress with dynamic graph data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining approaches have. Further we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the load-factor. Lastly we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of value lookups. Given the above HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs though HashGraph is not architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU HashGraph is anywhere from 2X-8X faster than cuDPP WarpDrive and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the same rate.</p>

Firstly FDCH learns unified binary codes through a fusion hash network with paired samples as input which effectively enhances the modeling of the correlation of heterogeneous multi-modal data. Then these high-quality unified hash codes further supervise the training of the modality-specific hash networks for encoding out-of-sample queries. Meanwhile both pair-wise similarity information and classification information are embedded in the hash networks under one stream framework which simultaneously preserves cross-modal similarity and keeps semantic consistency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of FDCH.</p>

	<td><p>Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However, large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain, thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand, unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information, although raw tags, in general, do not readily lead to semantic labels.
Motivated by this scenario, we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically, we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning.
Accordingly, we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Recently kernelized locality sensitive hashcodes have been successfully employed as representations of natural language text especially showing high relevance to biomedical relation extraction tasks. In this paper we propose to optimize the hashcode representations in a nearly unsupervised manner in which we only use data points but not their class labels for learning. The optimized hashcode representations are then fed to a supervised classifier following the prior work. This nearly unsupervised approach allows fine-grained optimization of each hash function which is particularly suitable for building hashcode representations generalizing from a training set to a test set. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach for biomedical relation extraction tasks obtaining significant accuracy improvements w.r.t. state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised approaches.</p>

Most existing deep hashing approaches solve the two tasks independently. While these two tasks are correlated and can reinforce each other. In this paper we propose a deep fine-grained hashing to simultaneously localize the discriminative regions and generate the efficient binary codes. The proposed approach consists of a region localization module and a hash coding module. The region localization module aims to provide informative regions to the hash coding module. The hash coding module aims to generate effective binary codes and give feedback for learning better localizer. Moreover to better capture subtle differences multi-scale regions at different layers are learned without the need of bounding-box/part annotations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmark fine-grained datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of our method relative to other fine-grained hashing algorithms.</p>

Images in database which are out of the interval are ignored in retrieval process. Therefore a database reduction occurs before retrieval which leads to speed up.

In combination with a hash algorithm that maps those weighted sets to compact signatures which allow fast estimation of pairwise similarities it constitutes a valuable method for big data applications such as near-duplicate detection nearest neighbor search or clustering. This paper introduces a class of one-pass locality-sensitive hash algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster than the original approach. The performance gain is achieved by calculating signature components not independently but collectively. Four different algorithms are proposed based on this idea. Two of them are statistically equivalent to the original approach and can be used as drop-in replacements. The other two may even improve the estimation error by introducing statistical dependence between signature components. Moreover the presented techniques can be specialized for the conventional Jaccard similarity resulting in highly efficient algorithms that outperform traditional minwise hashing and that are able to compete with the state of the art.</p>

Minimal perfect hash functions are used for example to map irregularly-shaped keys such as string in a compact space so that metadata can then be simply stored in an array. While it is known that just 1.44 bits per key are necessary to store a minimal perfect function no published technique can go below 2 bits per key in practice. We propose a new technique for storing minimal perfect hash functions with expected linear construction time and expected constant lookup time that makes it possible to build for the first time for example structures which need 1.56 bits per key that is within 8.3 of the lower bound in less than 2 ms per key. We show that instances of our construction are able to simultaneously beat the construction time space usage and lookup time of the state-of-the-art data structure reaching 2 bits per key. Moreover we provide parameter choices giving structures which are competitive with alternative larger-size data structures in terms of space and lookup time. The construction of our data structures can be easily parallelized or mapped on distributed computational units (e.g. within the MapReduce framework) and structures larger than the available RAM can be directly built in mass storage.</p>

Our approach simultaneously learns a mapping that transforms the input images into a low-dimensional discriminative space and quantizes the transformed data points using multi-codebook quantization. To eliminate the negative effect of norm variance on codebook learning we force the network to L_2 normalize the extracted features and then quantize the resulting vectors using a new supervised quantization technique specifically designed for points lying on a unit hypersphere. Furthermore we introduce an easy-to-implement extension of our quantization technique that enforces sparsity on the codebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSQ and its sparse variant can generate semantically separable compact binary codes outperforming many state-of-the-art image retrieval methods on three benchmarks.</p>

cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention for the
efficient cross-media retrieval. Typically, existing methods on crossmodal hashing treat labels of one instance independently but
overlook the correlations among labels. Indeed, in many real-world
scenarios, like the online fashion domain, instances (items) are
labeled with a set of categories correlated by certain hierarchy. In
this paper, we propose a new end-to-end solution for supervised
cross-modal hashing, named HiCHNet, which explicitly exploits the
hierarchical labels of instances. In particular, by the pre-established
label hierarchy, we comprehensively characterize each modality
of the instance with a set of layer-wise hash representations. In
essence, hash codes are encouraged to not only preserve the layerwise semantic similarities encoded by the label hierarchy, but also
retain the hierarchical discriminative capabilities. Due to the lack
of benchmark datasets, apart from adapting the existing dataset
FashionVC from fashion domain, we create a dataset from the
online fashion platform Ssense consisting of 15, 696 image-text
pairs labeled by 32 hierarchical categories. Extensive experiments
on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model

Most cross-modal hashing methods follow the traditional supervised hashing framework in which the O(n^2) data pairs and O(n^3) data triplets are generated for training but the training procedure is less efficient because the complexity is high for large-scale dataset. To address these issues we propose a novel and efficient cross-modal hashing algorithm in which the unary loss is introduced. First of all We introduce the Cross-Modal Unary Loss (CMUL) with O(n) complexity to bridge the traditional triplet loss and classification-based unary loss. A more accurate bound of the triplet loss for structured multilabel data is also proposed in CMUL. Second we propose the novel Joint Cluster Cross-Modal Hashing (JCCH) algorithm for efficient hash learning in which the CMUL is involved. The resultant hashcodes form several clusters in which the hashcodes in the same cluster share similar semantic information and the heterogeneity gap on different modalities is diminished by sharing the clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to be applied to various types of data and experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior over or comparable with state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods and training with the proposed method is more efficient than others.</p>

Generative hashing is often used to generate hashing codes in an unsupervised way. However existing generative hashing methods only considered the use of simple priors like Gaussian and Bernoulli priors which limits these methods to further improve their performance. In this paper two mixture-prior generative models are proposed under the objective to produce high-quality hashing codes for documents. Specifically a Gaussian mixture prior is first imposed onto the variational auto-encoder (VAE) followed by a separate step to cast the continuous latent representation of VAE into binary code. To avoid the performance loss caused by the separate casting a model using a Bernoulli mixture prior is further developed in which an end-to-end training is admitted by resorting to the straight-through (ST) discrete gradient estimator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods especially the one using Bernoulli mixture priors consistently outperform existing ones by a substantial margin.</p>

The traditional hashing methods in RS usually exploit hand-crafted features to learn hash functions to obtain binary codes which can be insufficient to optimally represent the information content of RS images. To overcome this problem in this paper we introduce a metric-learning based hashing network which learns 1) a semantic-based metric space for effective feature representation; and 2) compact binary hash codes for fast archive search. Our network considers an interplay of multiple loss functions that allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when binarized. Experiments carried out on two benchmark RS archives point out that the proposed network significantly improves the retrieval performance under the same retrieval time when compared to the state-of-the-art hashing methods in RS.</p>

	<td><p>Representing images by compact hash codes is an attractive approach for large-scale content-based image retrieval. In most state-of-the-art hashing-based image retrieval systems for each image local descriptors are first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous works the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. Hence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors. Furthermore we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.</p>

We devise dataindependent and data-dependent methods to distribute the satellites at appropriate locations. Our methods are based on finding the tradeoff between the information losses in these two steps. Experiments show that our data-dependent method outperforms other methods in different-sized data sets from 100k to 10M. By incorporating the orthogonality of the code matrix both our data-independent and data-dependent methods are particularly impressive in experiments on longer bits.</p>

	<td><p>Recent binary representation learning models usually require sophisticated binary optimization similarity measure or even generative models as auxiliaries. However one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics and can be related to many recent `learning to hash paradigms. We show that when properly designed even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models. Experiments are conducted on conventional large-scale benchmarks i.e. CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet where the proposed simple model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been recognized as an efficient representation learning method to effectively handle big data due to its low computational complexity and memory cost. Most of the existing hashing methods focus on learning the low-dimensional vectorized binary features based on the high-dimensional raw vectorized features. However studies on how to obtain preferable binary codes from the original 2D image features for retrieval is very limited. This paper proposes a bilinear supervised discrete hashing (BSDH) method based on 2D image features which utilizes bilinear projections to binarize the image matrix features such that the intrinsic characteristics in the 2D image space are preserved in the learned binary codes. Meanwhile the bilinear projection approximation and vectorization binary codes regression are seamlessly integrated together to formulate the final robust learning framework. Furthermore a discrete optimization strategy is developed to alternatively update each variable for obtaining the high-quality binary codes. In addition two 2D image features traditional SURF-based FVLAD feature and CNN-based AlexConv5 feature are designed for further improving the performance of the proposed BSDH method. Results of extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed BSDH method almost outperforms all competing hashing methods with different input features by different evaluation protocols.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed hashing has been recognized to accomplish similarity search in large-scale multimedia retrieval applications. Particularly supervised hashing has recently received considerable research attention by leveraging the label information to preserve the pairwise similarities of data points in the Hamming space. However there still remain two crucial bottlenecks 1) the learning process of the full pairwise similarity preservation is computationally unaffordable and unscalable to deal with big data; 2) the available category information of data are not well-explored to learn discriminative hash functions. To overcome these challenges we propose a unified Semantic-Aware DIscrete Hashing (SADIH) framework which aims to directly embed the transformed semantic information into the asymmetric similarity approximation and discriminative hashing function learning. Specifically a semantic-aware latent embedding is introduced to asymmetrically preserve the full pairwise similarities while skillfully handle the cumbersome n times n pairwise similarity matrix. Meanwhile a semantic-aware autoencoder is developed to jointly preserve the data structures in the discriminative latent semantic space and perform data reconstruction. Moreover an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that our SADIH can clearly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the additional benefit of lower computational costs.</p>

In contrast unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals. To address this issue we propose a novel deep unsupervised hashing model dubbed DistillHash which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data pairs which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically we investigate the relationship between the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal classifier. We show that under a mild assumption some data pairs of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier can be potentially distilled. Inspired by this fact we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the state-of-the-art search performance.</p>

Since color and edge orientation features are important visual information which help the human visual system percept and discriminate different images this method extracts and integrates color and edge orientation information in order to measure similarity between different images. Traditional color histograms merely focus on the global distribution of color in the image and therefore fail to extract other visual features. The MH is attempting to overcome this problem by extracting edge orientations as well as color feature. The unique characteristic of the MH is that it takes into consideration both color and edge orientation information in an effective manner.

In particularcross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in multimedia similarity search applications. However almost all existing methods employing cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their ignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains richer semantic information leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for cross-modal retrieval. First we utilize the triplet labels which describes the relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to capture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We then establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal view to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally graph regularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the original semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on two popular cross-modal datasets.</p>

This problem has applications in various fields including the database search problem in mass spectrometry. The problem is analogous to the nearest neighbor search problem where the goal is to find the data point in a database that is the most similar to a query point. The state of the art method for solving an approximate version of the nearest neighbor search problem in high dimensions is locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH is based on designing hash functions that map near points to the same buckets with a probability higher than random (far) points. To solve our high dimensional classification problem we introduce distribution sensitive hashes that map jointly generated pairs (xy)sim P to the same bucket with probability higher than random pairs xsim P^A and ysim P^B where P^A and P^B are the marginal probability distributions of P. We design distribution sensitive hashes using a forest of decision trees and we show that the complexity of search grows with O(N^lambda^(P)) where lambda^(P) is expressed in an analytical form. We further show that the proposed hashes perform faster than state of the art approximate nearest neighbor search methods for a range of probability distributions in both theory and simulations. Finally we apply our method to the spectral library search problem in mass spectrometry and show that it is an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing can desirably support scalable content-based image retrieval (SCBIR) for its appealing advantages of semantic label independence memory and search efficiency. However the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem in this paper we propose a novel hashing approach dubbed as (DSTH). The key idea is to augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss we explicitly impose the discrete constraint bitâuncorrelation constraint and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing method maps similar high-dimensional data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance and it has received broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. Pairwise similarity is easily obtained and widely used for retrieval and most supervised hashing algorithms are carefully designed for the pairwise supervisions. As labeling all data pairs is difficult semi-supervised hashing is proposed which aims at learning efficient codes with limited labeled pairs and abundant unlabeled ones. Existing methods build graphs to capture the structure of dataset but they are not working well for complex data as the graph is built based on the data representations and determining the representations of complex data is difficult. In this paper we propose a novel teacher-student semi-supervised hashing framework in which the student is trained with the pairwise information produced by the teacher network. The network follows the smoothness assumption which achieves consistent distances for similar data pairs so that the retrieval results are similar for neighborhood queries. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method reaches impressive gain over the supervised baselines and is superior to state-of-the-art semi-supervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Image retrieval utilizes image descriptors to retrieve the most similar images to a given query image. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is becoming the dominant approach to extract image descriptors for image retrieval. For low-power hardware implementation of image retrieval the drawback of CNN-based feature descriptor is that it requires hundreds of megabytes of storage. To address this problem this paper applies deep model quantization and compression to CNN in ASIC chip for image retrieval. It is demonstrated that the CNN-based features descriptor can be extracted using as few as 2-bit weights quantization to deliver a similar performance as floating-point model for image retrieval. In addition to implement CNN in ASIC especially for large scale images the limited buffer size of chips should be considered. To retrieve large scale images we propose an improved pooling strategy region nested invariance pooling (RNIP) which uses cropped sub-images for CNN. Testing results on chip show that integrating RNIP with the proposed 2-bit CNN model compression approach is capable of retrieving large scale images.</p>

In the light of this, it is able to make better use of label information and generate better binary codes. In addition, different from other two-step methods that mainly focus on the hash codes learning, TECH adopts a new hash function learning strategy in the second step, which also preserves the similarity in the original space. Moreover, with the help of well designed objective function and optimization scheme, it is able to generate hash codes discretely and scalable for large scale data. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first cross-modal hashing method exploiting label correlations, and also the first two-step hashing model preserving the similarity while leaning hash function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Dynamic load balancing lies at the heart of distributed caching. Here the goal is to assign objects (load) to servers (computing nodes) in a way that provides load balancing while at the same time dynamically adjusts to the addition or removal of servers. One essential requirement is that the addition or removal of small servers should not require us to recompute the complete assignment. A popular and widely adopted solution is the two-decade-old Consistent Hashing (CH). Recently an elegant extension was provided to account for server bounds. In this paper we identify that existing methodologies for CH and its variants suffer from cascaded overflow leading to poor load balancing. This cascading effect leads to decreasing performance of the hashing procedure with increasing load. To overcome the cascading effect we propose a simple solution to CH based on recent advances in fast minwise hashing. We show both theoretically and empirically that our proposed solution is significantly superior for load balancing and is optimal in many senses. On the AOL search dataset and Indiana University Clicks dataset with real user activity our proposed solution reduces cache misses by several magnitudes.</p>

	<td><p>Recent binary representation learning models usually require sophisticated binary optimization, similarity measure or even generative models as auxiliaries. However, one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper, we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective, our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network, whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics, and can be related to many recent `learning to hashâ paradigms. We show that, when properly designed, even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes, by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models. Experiments are conducted on conventional large-scale benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet, where the proposed simple model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Image retrieval can be formulated as a ranking problem where the goal is to order database images by decreasing similarity to the query. Recent deep models for image retrieval have outperformed traditional methods by leveraging ranking-tailored loss functions but important theoretical and practical problems remain. First rather than directly optimizing the global ranking they minimize an upper-bound on the essential loss which does not necessarily result in an optimal mean average precision (mAP). Second these methods require significant engineering efforts to work well e.g. special pre-training and hard-negative mining. In this paper we propose instead to directly optimize the global mAP by leveraging recent advances in listwise loss formulations. Using a histogram binning approximation the AP can be differentiated and thus employed to end-to-end learning. Compared to existing losses the proposed method considers thousands of images simultaneously at each iteration and eliminates the need for ad hoc tricks. It also establishes a new state of the art on many standard retrieval benchmarks. Models and evaluation scripts have been made available at httpseurope.naverlabs.com/Deep-Image-Retrieval/</p>

However, due to the high computation cost and the limited hardwareâs memory, these methods will first select a subset from the training set, and then form a mini-batch data to update the network in each iteration. Therefore, the remaining labeled data cannot be fully utilized and the model cannot directly obtain the binary codes of the entire training set for retrieval. To address these problems, this paper proposes an interesting regularized deep model to seamlessly integrate the advantages of deep hashing and efficient binary code learning by using the anchor graph. As such, the deep features and label matrix can be jointly used to optimize the binary codes, and the network can obtain more discriminative feedback from the linear combinations of the learned bits. Moreover, we also reveal the algorithm mechanism and its computation essence. Experiments on three large-scale datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves better retrieval performance with less training time compared to previous deep hashing methods.</p>

Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts generated during the manipulation process we use an image retrieval approach to tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image our goal is to retrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve this goal we propose representing an image by its constituent objects based on the intuition that the finest granularity of manipulations is oftentimes at the object-level. We introduce a framework object embeddings for spliced image retrieval (OE-SIR) that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object regions. Each region is then embedded and collectively used to represent the image. Further we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning discriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple forward passes. Detailed analysis of the efficacy of different feature embedding models is also provided in this study. Extensive experimental results show that the OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image retrieval.</p>

However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>As an approximate nearest neighbor search technique hashing has been widely applied in large-scale image retrieval due to its excellent efficiency. Most supervised deep hashing methods have similar loss designs with embedding learning while quantizing the continuous high-dim feature into compact binary space. We argue that the existing deep hashing schemes are defective in two issues that seriously affect the performance i.e. bit independence and bit balance. The former refers to hash codes of different classes should be independent of each other while the latter means each bit should have a balanced distribution of +1s and -1s. In this paper we propose a novel supervised deep hashing method termed Hadamard Codebook based Deep Hashing (HCDH) which solves the above two problems in a unified formulation. Specifically we utilize an off-the-shelf algorithm to generate a binary Hadamard codebook to satisfy the requirement of bit independence and bit balance which subsequently serves as the desired outputs of the hash functions learning. We also introduce a projection matrix to solve the inconsistency between the order of Hadamard matrix and the number of classes. Besides the proposed HCDH further exploits the supervised labels by constructing a classifier on top of the outputs of hash functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCDH can yield discriminative and balanced binary codes which well outperforms many state-of-the-arts on three widely-used benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval, due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover, to accurately capture the query variations, at the online retrieval stage, we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach from various aspects.</p>

In this paper we introduce a metric learning algorithm that focuses on identifying and modifying those feature vectors that most strongly affect the retrieval quality. We compute normalized approximated ranks and convert them to similarities by applying a nonlinear transfer function. These similarities are used in a newly proposed loss function that better contracts similar and disperses dissimilar samples. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement over existing deep feature embedding methods on the CUB-200-2011 Cars196 and Stanford Online Products data sets for all embedding sizes.</p>

	<td><p>In large scale systems approximate nearest neighbour search is a crucial algorithm to enable efficient data retrievals. Recently deep learning-based hashing algorithms have been proposed as a promising paradigm to enable data dependent schemes. Often their efficacy is only demonstrated on data sets with fixed limited numbers of classes. In practical scenarios those labels are not always available or one requires a method that can handle a higher input variability as well as a higher granularity. To fulfil those requirements we look at more flexible similarity measures. In this work we present a novel flexible end-to-end trainable network for large-scale data hashing. Our method works by transforming the data distribution to behave as a uniform distribution on a product of spheres. The transformed data is subsequently hashed to a binary form in a way that maximises entropy of the output (i.e. to fully utilise the available bit-rate capacity) while maintaining the correctness (i.e. close items hash to the same key in the map). We show that the method outperforms baseline approaches such as locality-sensitive hashing and product quantisation in the limited capacity regime.</p>

	<td><p>Large-scale cross-modal hashing similarity retrieval has attracted more and more attention in modern search applications such as search engines and autopilot showing great superiority in computation and storage. However current unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods still have some limitations (1)many methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization objective which may significantly degrade the retrieval performance;(2)most existing hashing model project heterogenous data into a common latent space which may always lose sight of diversity in heterogenous data;(3)transforming real-valued data point to binary codes always results in abundant loss of information producing the suboptimal continuous latent space. To overcome above problems in this paper a novel Cluster-wise Unsupervised Hashing (CUH) method is proposed. Specifically CUH jointly performs the multi-view clustering that projects the original data points from different modalities into its own low-dimensional latent semantic space and finds the cluster centroid points and the common clustering indicators in its own low-dimensional space and learns the compact hash codes and the corresponding linear hash functions. An discrete optimization framework is developed to learn the unified binary codes across modalities under the guidance cluster-wise code-prototypes. The reasonableness and effectiveness of CUH is well demonstrated by comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets.</p>

A popular and effective technique in computing nearest neighbors approximately is the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme. In this paper we aim to develop LSH schemes for distance functions that measure the distance between two probability distributions particularly for f-divergences as well as a generalization to capture mutual information loss. First we provide a general framework to design LHS schemes for f-divergence distance functions and develop LSH schemes for the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence and triangular discrimination in this framework. We show a two-sided approximation result for approximation of the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence by the Hellinger distance which may be of independent interest. Next we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search. We exemplify this method by applying it to the mutual information loss due to its several important applications such as model compression.</p>

This similarity does not model the full rich knowledge of semantic relations that may be present between data points. In this work we build upon the idea of using semantic hierarchies to form distance metrics between all available sample labels; for example cat to dog has a smaller distance than cat to guitar. We combine this type of semantic distance into a loss function to promote similar distances between the deep neural network embeddings. We also introduce an empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence loss term to promote binarization and uniformity of the embeddings. We test the resulting SHREWD method and demonstrate improvements in hierarchical retrieval scores using compact binary hash codes instead of real valued ones and show that in a weakly supervised hashing setting we are able to learn competitively without explicitly relying on class labels but instead on similarities between labels.</p>

The conventional quantization strategies, such as Single-Bit Quantization and Multi-Bit quantization, are considered ineffective, because of their serious information loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel variable-length quantization (VLQ) strategy for hashing. In the proposed VLQ technique, we divide all samples into different regions in each dimension firstly given the real-valued features of samples. Then we compute the dispersion degrees of these regions. Subsequently, we attempt to optimally assign different number of bits to each dimensions to obtain the minimum dispersion degree. Our experiments show that the VLQ strategy achieves not only superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, but also has a faster retrieval speed on public datasets.</p>

The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as consisting of c=O(1) characters e.g. a 64-bit key as c=8 characters of 8-bits. The character domain Sigma should be small enough that character tables of size Sigma fit in fast cache. The schemes then use O(1) tables of this size so the space of tabulation hashing is O(Sigma). However the concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are ll Sigma. To see the problem consider the very simple case where we use tabulation hashing to throw n balls into m bins and want to analyse the number of balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds we are fine if n=m for then the expected value is 1. However if m=2 as when tossing n unbiased coins the expected value n/2 is gg Sigma for large data sets e.g. data sets that do not fit in fast cache. To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space we need a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation plus a new tabulation technique that we call hashing which is at most twice as slow as simple tabulation. No other hashing scheme of comparable speed offers similar Chernoff-style concentration bounds.</p>

	<td><p>Many retrieval applications can benefit from multiple modalities e.g. text that contains images on Wikipedia for which how to represent multimodal data is the critical component. Most deep multimodal learning methods typically involve two steps to construct the joint representations 1) learning of multiple intermediate features with each intermediate feature corresponding to a modality using separate and independent deep models; 2) merging the intermediate features into a joint representation using a fusion strategy. However in the first step these intermediate features do not have previous knowledge of each other and cannot fully exploit the information contained in the other modalities. In this paper we present a modal-aware operation as a generic building block to capture the non-linear dependences among the heterogeneous intermediate features that can learn the underlying correlation structures in other multimodal data as soon as possible. The modal-aware operation consists of a kernel network and an attention network. The kernel network is utilized to learn the non-linear relationships with other modalities. Then to learn better representations for binary hash codes we present an attention network that finds the informative regions of these modal-aware features that are favorable for retrieval. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of our method relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

The proposed framework utilizes archetypal analysis a matrix factorization technique to obtain convex-sparse representations of a bird vocalization. These convex representations are hashed using Bloom filters with non-cryptographic hash functions to obtain compact binary codes designated as conv-codes. The conv-codes extracted from the training examples are clustered using class-specific k-medoids clustering with Jaccard coefficient as the similarity metric. A hash table is populated using the cluster centers as keys while hash values/slots are pointers to the species identification information. During testing the hash table is searched to find the species information corresponding to a cluster center that exhibits maximum similarity with the test conv-code. Hence the proposed framework classifies a bird vocalization in the conv-code space and requires no explicit classifier or reconstruction error calculations. Apart from that based on min-hash and direct addressing we also propose a variant of the proposed framework that provides faster and effective classification. The performances of both these frameworks are compared with existing bird species classification frameworks on the audio recordings of 50 different bird species.</p>

	<td><p>Sketching is a randomized dimensionality-reduction method that aims to preserve relevant information in large-scale datasets. Count sketch is a simple popular sketch which uses a randomized hash function to achieve compression. In this paper we propose a novel extension known as Higher-order Count Sketch (HCS). While count sketch uses a single hash function HCS uses multiple (smaller) hash functions for sketching. HCS reshapes the input (vector) data into a higher-order tensor and employs a tensor product of the random hash functions to compute the sketch. This results in an exponential saving (with respect to the order of the tensor) in the memory requirements of the hash functions under certain conditions on the input data. Furthermore when the input data itself has an underlying structure in the form of various tensor representations such as the Tucker decomposition we obtain significant advantages. We derive efficient (approximate) computation of various tensor operations such as tensor products and tensor contractions directly on the sketched data. Thus HCS is the first sketch to fully exploit the multi-dimensional nature of higher-order tensors. We apply HCS to tensorized neural networks where we replace fully connected layers with sketched tensor operations. We achieve nearly state of the art accuracy with significant compression on the image classification benchmark.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we address the problem of searching for semantically similar images from a large database. We present a compact coding approach supervised quantization. Our approach simultaneously learns feature selection that linearly transforms the database points into a low-dimensional discriminative subspace and quantizes the data points in the transformed space. The optimization criterion is that the quantized points not only approximate the transformed points accurately but also are semantically separable the points belonging to a class lie in a cluster that is not overlapped with other clusters corresponding to other classes which is formulated as a classification problem. The experiments on several standard datasets show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the art supervised hashing and unsupervised quantization algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised near-duplicate detection has many practical applications ranging from social media analysis and web-scale retrieval to digital image forensics. It entails running a threshold-limited query on a set of descriptors extracted from the images with the goal of identifying all possible near-duplicates while limiting the false positives due to visually similar images. Since the rate of false alarms grows with the dataset size a very high specificity is thus required up to 1 - 10^-9 for realistic use cases; this important requirement however is often overlooked in literature. In recent years descriptors based on deep convolutional neural networks have matched or surpassed traditional feature extraction methods in content-based image retrieval tasks. To the best of our knowledge ours is the first attempt to establish the performance range of deep learning-based descriptors for unsupervised near-duplicate detection on a range of datasets encompassing a broad spectrum of near-duplicate definitions. We leverage both established and new benchmarks such as the Mir-Flick Near-Duplicate (MFND) dataset in which a known ground truth is provided for all possible pairs over a general large scale image collection. To compare the specificity of different descriptors we reduce the problem of unsupervised detection to that of binary classification of near-duplicate vs. not-near-duplicate images. The latter can be conveniently characterized using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). Our findings in general favor the choice of fine-tuning deep convolutional networks as opposed to using off-the-shelf features but differences at high specificity settings depend on the dataset and are often small. The best performance was observed on the MFND benchmark achieving 96 sensitivity at a false positive rate of 1.43 times 10^-6.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel image hashing method termed as symmetric eep emantic uantization (). is implemented using three stream frameworks which consist of one and two . The leverages the power of three fully-connected layers which are used to capture rich semantic information between image pairs.

Specifically the function of the is to capture rich semantic information that is used to guide the two in minimizing the gap between the real-continuous features and the discrete binary codes. Furthermore can utilize the most critical semantic information to guide the feature learning process and consider the consistency of the common semantic space and Hamming space.

We propose a cross-modal quantization approach which is among the early attempts to introduce quantization into cross-modal search. The major contribution lies in jointly learning the quantizers for both modalities through aligning the quantized representations for each pair of image and text belonging to a document. In addition our approach simultaneously learns the common space for both modalities in which quantization is conducted to enable efficient and effective search using the Euclidean distance computed in the common space with fast distance table lookup.

	<td><p>Hashtags in online social networks have gained tremendous popularity during the past five years. The resulting large quantity of data has provided a new lens into modern society. Previously researchers mainly rely on data collected from Twitter to study either a certain type of hashtags or a certain property of hashtags. In this paper we perform the first large-scale empirical analysis of hashtags shared on Instagram the major platform for hashtag-sharing. We study hashtags from three different dimensions including the temporal-spatial dimension the semantic dimension and the social dimension. Extensive experiments performed on three large-scale datasets with more than 7 million hashtags in total provide a series of interesting observations. First we show that the temporal patterns of hashtags can be categorized into four different clusters and people tend to share fewer hashtags at certain places and more hashtags at others. Second we observe that a non-negligible proportion of hashtags exhibit large semantic displacement. We demonstrate hashtags that are more uniformly shared among users as quantified by the proposed hashtag entropy are less prone to semantic displacement. In the end we propose a bipartite graph embedding model to summarize users hashtag profiles and rely on these profiles to perform friendship prediction. Evaluation results show that our approach achieves an effective prediction with AUC (area under the ROC curve) above 0.8 which demonstrates the strong social signals possessed in hashtags.</p>

The goal of the problem is to preprocess n strings of length d to quickly answer queries q of the form if there is a database string within edit distance r of q return a database string within edit distance cr of q. Previous approaches to this problem either rely on very large (superconstant) approximation ratios c or very small search radii r. Outside of a narrow parameter range these solutions are not competitive with trivially searching through all n strings. In this work give a simple and easy-to-implement hash function that can quickly answer queries for a wide range of parameters. Specifically our strategy can answer queries in time (d3^rn^1/c). The best known practical results require c gg r to achieve any correctness guarantee; meanwhile the best known theoretical results are very involved and difficult to implement and require query time at least 24^r. Our results significantly broaden the range of parameters for which we can achieve nontrivial bounds while retaining the practicality of a locality-sensitive hash function. We also show how to apply our ideas to the closely-related Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem for edit distance obtaining similar time bounds.</p>

Particularly cross-modal retrieval that searches across different modalities becomes an active but challenging problem. Although dozens of cross-modal hashing algorithms are proposed to yield compact binary codes the exhaustive search is impractical for the real-time purpose and Hamming distance computation suffers inaccurate results. In this paper we propose a novel search method that utilizes a probability-based index scheme over binary hash codes in cross-modal retrieval. The proposed hash code indexing scheme exploits a few binary bits of the hash code as the index code. We construct an inverted index table based on index codes and train a neural network to improve the indexing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets for retrieval across image and text modalities where hash codes are generated by three cross-modal hashing methods.

	<td><p>Deep metric learning applied to various applications has shown promising results in identification retrieval and recognition. Existing methods often do not consider different granularity in visual similarity. However in many domain applications images exhibit similarity at multiple granularities with visual semantic concepts e.g. fashion demonstrates similarity ranging from clothing of the exact same instance to similar looks/design or a common category. Therefore training image triplets/pairs used for metric learning inherently possess different degree of information. However the existing methods often treats them with equal importance during training. This hinders capturing the underlying granularities in feature similarity required for effective visual search. In view of this we propose a new deep semantic granularity metric learning (SGML) that develops a novel idea of leveraging attribute semantic space to capture different granularity of similarity and then integrate this information into deep metric learning. The proposed method simultaneously learns image attributes and embeddings using multitask CNNs. The two tasks are not only jointly optimized but are further linked by the semantic granularity similarity mappings to leverage the correlations between the tasks. To this end we propose a new soft-binomial deviance loss that effectively integrates the degree of information in training samples which helps to capture visual similarity at multiple granularities. Compared to recent ensemble-based methods our framework is conceptually elegant computationally simple and provides better performance. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark metric learning datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods e.g. 1-4.5 improvement in Recall@1 over the previous state-of-the-arts 12 on DeepFashion In-Shop dataset.</p>

To respect the natural diversity within the categorical data embeddings map each category to a unique dense representation within an embedded space. Since each categorical feature could take on as many as tens of millions of different possible categories the embedding tables form the primary memory bottleneck during both training and inference. We propose a novel approach for reducing the embedding size in an end-to-end fashion by exploiting complementary partitions of the category set to produce a unique embedding vector for each category without explicit definition. By storing multiple smaller embedding tables based on each complementary partition and combining embeddings from each table we define a unique embedding for each category at smaller memory cost. This approach may be interpreted as using a specific fixed codebook to ensure uniqueness of each categorys representation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over the hashing trick for reducing the size of the embedding tables in terms of model loss and accuracy while retaining a similar reduction in the number of parameters.</p>

However it is challenging for conventional retrieval systems to match up the item photos captured by customers and the ones officially released by stores especially for garment images. To bridge the customer- and store- provided garment photos existing studies have been widely exploiting the clothing attributes ( black) and landmarks ( collar) to learn a common embedding space for garment representations. Unfortunately they omit the sequential correlation of attributes and consume large quantity of human labors to label the landmarks. In this paper we propose a deep multi-task cross-domain hashing termed in which cross-domain embedding and sequential attribute learning are modeled simultaneously. Sequential attribute learning not only provides the semantic guidance for embedding but also generates rich attention on discriminative local details ( black buttons) of clothing items without requiring extra landmark labels. This leads to promising performance and 306times boost on efficiency when compared with the state-of-the-art models which is demonstrated through rigorous experiments on two public fashion datasets.</p>

The process is computationally expensive ill-posed to illumination background composition pose variation as well as inefficient to be deployed on gallery sets with more than 1000 elements. Hashing is a faster alternative which involves representing images in reduced dimensional simple feature spaces. Encoding images into binary hash codes enables similarity comparison in an image-pair using the Hamming distance measure. The challenge however lies in encoding the images using a semantic hashing scheme that lets subjective neighbors lie within the tolerable Hamming radius. This work presents a solution employing adversarial learning of a deep neural semantic hashing network for fashion inventory retrieval. It consists of a feature extracting convolutional neural network (CNN) learned to (i) minimize error in classifying type of clothing (ii) minimize hamming distance between semantic neighbors and maximize distance between semantically dissimilar images (iii) maximally scramble a discriminators ability to identify the corresponding hash code-image pair when processing a semantically similar query-gallery image pair. Experimental validation for fashion inventory search yields a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.65 in finding the closest match as compared to 53.26 obtained by the prior art of deep Cauchy hashing for hamming space retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Minimal perfect hash functions (MPHFs) are used to provide efficient access to values of large dictionaries (sets of key-value pairs). Discovering new algorithms for building MPHFs is an area of active research especially from the perspective of storage efficiency. The information-theoretic limit for MPHFs is 1/(ln 2) or roughly 1.44 bits per key. The current best practical algorithms range between 2 and 4 bits per key. In this article we propose two SAT-based constructions of MPHFs. Our first construction yields MPHFs near the information-theoretic limit. For this construction current state-of-the-art SAT solvers can handle instances where the dictionaries contain up to 40 elements thereby outperforming the existing (brute-force) methods. Our second construction uses XOR-SAT filters to realize a practical approach with long-term storage of approximately 1.83 bits per key.</p>

	<td><p>Supervised cross-modal hashing has gained increasing research interest on large-scale retrieval task owning to its satisfactory performance and efficiency. However it still has some challenging issues to be further studied 1) most of them fail to well preserve the semantic correlations in hash codes because of the large heterogenous gap; 2) most of them relax the discrete constraint on hash codes leading to large quantization error and consequent low performance; 3) most of them suffer from relatively high memory cost and computational complexity during training procedure which makes them unscalable. In this paper to address above issues we propose a supervised cross-modal hashing method based on matrix factorization dubbed Efficient Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically collective matrix factorization on heterogenous features and semantic embedding with class labels are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore the feature based similarities and semantic correlations can be both preserved in hash codes which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative. Then an efficient discrete optimal algorithm is proposed to handle the scalable issue. Instead of learning hash codes bit-by-bit hash codes matrix can be obtained directly which is more efficient. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that EDSH produces a superior performance in both accuracy and scalability over some existing cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>This paper tackles a rarely explored but critical problem within learning to hash, i.e., to learn hash codes that effectively discriminate hard similar and dissimilar examples, to empower large-scale image retrieval. Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples. Extensive empirical results on three widely-used image retrieval datasets show that (i) our method consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods using hash codes of the same length and (ii) our method can use significantly (e.g., 50%-75%) shorter hash codes to perform substantially better than, or comparably well to, the competing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However the cost of annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new domain. Moreover the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage could come from similar but different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented which mainly consists of four components a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses i.e. adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep hash models.</p>

	<td><p>To convert the input into binary code, hashing algorithm has been widely used for approximate nearest neighbor search on large-scale image sets due to its computation and storage efficiency. Deep hashing further improves the retrieval quality by combining the hash coding with deep neural network. However, a major difficulty in deep hashing lies in the discrete constraints imposed on the network output, which generally makes the optimization NP hard. In this work, we adopt the greedy principle to tackle this NP hard problem by iteratively updating the network toward the probable optimal discrete solution in each iteration. A hash coding layer is designed to implement our approach which strictly uses the sign function in forward propagation to maintain the discrete constraints, while in back propagation the gradients are transmitted intactly to the front layer to avoid the vanishing gradients. In addition to the theoretical derivation, we provide a new perspective to visualize and understand the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods in both supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p>

In this work the revised LDA objective is transformed into a simple least square problem which naturally overcomes the intractable problems and can be easily solved by the off-the-shelf optimizer. Such deep extension can also overcome the weakness of LDA Hashing in the limited linear projection and feature learning. Amounts of experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets.

To achieve this goal we propose a novel approach named BWNH to train Binary Weight Networks via Hashing. In this paper we first reveal the strong connection between inner-product preserving hashing and binary weight networks and show that training binary weight networks can be intrinsically regarded as a hashing problem. Based on this perspective we propose an alternating optimization method to learn the hash codes instead of directly learning binary weights. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed BWNH outperforms current state-of-art by a large margin.</p>

	<td><p>Many mobile systems and wearable devices such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) headsets lack a keyboard or touchscreen to type an ID and password for signing into a virtual website. However they are usually equipped with gesture capture interfaces to allow the user to interact with the system directly with hand gestures. Although gesture-based authentication has been well-studied less attention is paid to the gesture-based user identification problem which is essentially an input method of account ID and an efficient searching and indexing method of a database of gesture signals. In this paper we propose FMHash (i.e. Finger Motion Hash) a user identification framework that can generate a compact binary hash code from a piece of in-air-handwriting of an ID string. This hash code enables indexing and fast search of a large account database using the in-air-handwriting by a hash table. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework we implemented a prototype and achieved 99.5 precision and 92.6 recall with exact hash code match on a dataset of 200 accounts collected by us. The ability of hashing in-air-handwriting pattern to binary code can be used to achieve convenient sign-in and sign-up with in-air-handwriting gesture ID on future mobile and wearable systems connected to the Internet.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity joins are a fundamental database operation. Given data sets S and R the goal of a similarity join is to find all points x in S and y in R with distance at most r. Recent research has investigated how locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) can be used for similarity join and in particular two recent lines of work have made exciting progress on LSH-based join performance. Hu Tao and Yi (PODS 17) investigated joins in a massively parallel setting showing strong results that adapt to the size of the output. Meanwhile Ahle Aumuller and Pagh (SODA 17) showed a sequential algorithm that adapts to the structure of the data matching classic bounds in the worst case but improving them significantly on more structured data. We show that this adaptive strategy can be adapted to the parallel setting combining the advantages of these approaches. In particular we show that a simple modification to Hu et al.s algorithm achieves bounds that depend on the density of points in the dataset as well as the total outsize of the output. Our algorithm uses no extra parameters over other LSH approaches (in particular its execution does not depend on the structure of the dataset) and is likely to be efficient in practice.</p>

	<td><p>For unsupervised data-dependent hashing the two most important requirements are to preserve similarity in the low-dimensional feature space and to minimize the binary quantization loss. A well-established hashing approach is Iterative Quantization (ITQ) which addresses these two requirements in separate steps. In this paper we revisit the ITQ approach and propose novel formulations and algorithms to the problem. Specifically we propose a novel approach named Simultaneous Compression and Quantization (SCQ) to jointly learn to compress (reduce dimensionality) and binarize input data in a single formulation under strict orthogonal constraint. With this approach we introduce a loss function and its relaxed version termed Orthonormal Encoder (OnE) and Orthogonal Encoder (OgE) respectively which involve challenging binary and orthogonal constraints. We propose to attack the optimization using novel algorithms based on recent advances in cyclic coordinate descent approach. Comprehensive experiments on unsupervised image retrieval demonstrate that our proposed methods consistently outperform other state-of-the-art hashing methods. Notably our proposed methods outperform recent deep neural networks and GAN based hashing in accuracy while being very computationally-efficient.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel more discriminative descriptor that includes not only local feature representation but also information about the geometric layout of neighbouring keypoints. To that end we use a Siamese architecture that learns a low-dimensional feature embedding of keypoint constellation by maximizing the distances between non-corresponding pairs of matched image patches while minimizing it for correct matches. The 48-dimensional oating point descriptor that we train is built on top of the state-of-the-art FREAK descriptor achieves significant performance improvement over the competitors on a challenging TUM dataset.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance which has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. With the rapid development of deep learning deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data but the training is difficult and less efficient because O(n^2) data pairs and O(n^3) triplets are involved. To address these issues we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. We first of all introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss thus reducing the complexity to O(n) and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss named Semantic Cluster Unary Loss (SCUL). The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters which means hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to be extended to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable progress by incorporating semantic side information. However they mainly have two limitations (1) Heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training data which are labor intensive and hard to obtain. (2) Ignore the rich information contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different modalities especially the margin examples that are easily to be incorrectly retrieved which can help to model the correlations. To address these problems in this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-Modal Hashing approach by Generative Adversarial Network (SCH-GAN). We aim to take advantage of GANs ability for modeling data distributions to promote cross-modal hashing learning in an adversarial way. The main contributions can be summarized as follows (1) We propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing. In our proposed SCH-GAN the generative model tries to select margin examples of one modality from unlabeled data when giving a query of another modality. While the discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true positive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that the generative model can promote the hashing performance of discriminative model. (2) We propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm to drive the training of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score predicted by discriminative model as a reward and tries to select the examples close to the margin to promote discriminative model by maximizing the margin between positive and negative data. Experiments on 3 widely-used datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

Providing training and test data subjected to a fixed set of pre-defined categories the cutting-edge SBIR and cross-modal hashing works obtain acceptable retrieval performance. However most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero-shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch-image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution respectively. As an important part of ZSIH we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge ZSIH is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets i.e. Sketchy and TU-Berlin with a novel zero-shot train-test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of multimedia data (e.g. image audio and video etc.) on the web learning-based hashing techniques such as Deep Supervised Hashing (DSH) have proven to be very efficient for large-scale multimedia search. The recent successes seen in Learning-based hashing methods are largely due to the success of deep learning-based hashing methods. However there are some limitations to previous learning-based hashing methods (e.g. the learned hash codes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper we propose a novel learning-based hashing method named Deep Attention-guided Hashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea is to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the first stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of the hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing network). Specifically in the first network it leverages an attention network and hashing network to generate the attention-guided hash codes from the original images. The loss function we propose contains two components the semantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the attention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the second network these attention-guided hash codes are used to guide the training of the second hashing network (i.e. these codes are treated as supervised labels to train the second network). By doing this DAgH can make full use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the second hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true end-to-end fashion. Results from our experiments demonstrate that DAgH can generate high quality hash codes and it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal retrieval between visual data and natural language description remains a long-standing challenge in multimedia. While recent image-text retrieval methods offer great promise by learning deep representations aligned across modalities most of these methods are plagued by the issue of training with small-scale datasets covering a limited number of images with ground-truth sentences. Moreover it is extremely expensive to create a larger dataset by annotating millions of images with sentences and may lead to a biased model. Inspired by the recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural networks we capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations to learn robust image-text joint representation. Specifically our main idea is to leverage web images and corresponding tags along with fully annotated datasets in training for learning the visual-semantic joint embedding. We propose a two-stage approach for the task that can augment a typical supervised pair-wise ranking loss based formulation with weakly-annotated web images to learn a more robust visual-semantic embedding. Experiments on two standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a significant performance gain in image-text retrieval compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Recently deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue in this paper we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.</p>

proposed in recent years, most of them are confronted by the dilemma
to obtain optimal binary codes in a truly end-to-end manner with nonsmooth sign activations. Unlike existing methods which usually employ a
general relaxation framework to adapt to the gradient-based algorithms,
our approach formulates the non-smooth part of the hashing network
as sampling with a stochastic policy, so that the retrieval performance
degradation caused by the relaxation can be avoided. Specifically, our
method directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation, where the network can be
trained directly via policy gradient. Hence, the differentiation challenge
for discrete optimization can be naturally addressed, which leads to effective gradients and binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three
benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Deep supervised hashing has become an active topic in information retrieval. It generates hashing bits by the output neurons of a deep hashing network. During binary discretization there often exists much redundancy between hashing bits that degenerates retrieval performance in terms of both storage and accuracy. This paper proposes a simple yet effective Neurons Merging Layer (NMLayer) for deep supervised hashing. A graph is constructed to represent the redundancy relationship between hashing bits that is used to guide the learning of a hashing network. Specifically it is dynamically learned by a novel mechanism defined in our active and frozen phases. According to the learned relationship the NMLayer merges the redundant neurons together to balance the importance of each output neuron. Moreover multiple NMLayers are progressively trained for a deep hashing network to learn a more compact hashing code from a long redundant code. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Feature hashing also known as em the hashing trick introduced by Weinberger et al. (2009) is one of the key techniques used in scaling-up machine learning algorithms. Loosely speaking feature hashing uses a random sparse projection matrix A ^n to ^m (where m ll n) in order to reduce the dimension of the data from n to m while approximately preserving the Euclidean norm. Every column of A contains exactly one non-zero entry equals to either -1 or 1. Weinberger et al. showed tail bounds on Ax_2^2. Specifically they showed that for every varepsilon delta if x_infty / x_2 is sufficiently small and m is sufficiently large then Pr ; ;Ax_2^2 - x_2^2; &lt; varepsilon x_2^2 ; ge 1 - delta ;. These bounds were later extended by Dasgupta etal (2010) and most recently refined by Dahlgaard et al. (2017) however the true nature of the performance of this key technique and specifically the correct tradeoff between the pivotal parameters x_infty / x_2 m varepsilon delta remained an open question. We settle this question by giving tight asymptotic bounds on the exact tradeoff between the central parameters thus providing a complete understanding of the performance of feature hashing. We complement the asymptotic bound with empirical data which shows that the constants hiding in the asymptotic notation are in fact very close to 1 thus further illustrating the tightness of the presented bounds in practice.</p>

	<td><p>Hash coding has been widely used in the approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Recently many deep hashing methods have been proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise similarity on the semantic-level labels where the pairwise similarity is generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is the pairwise similarity is 1 if they share no less than one class label and 0 if they do not share any. However such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper a new deep hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the pairwise similarity into an instance similarity where the instance similarity is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based on the instance similarity a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction and are efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label image retrieval.</p>

We encode the indexed vectors using quantization and exploit the graph structure to refine the similarity estimation. In essence our method takes the best of these two worlds the search strategy is based on nested graphs thereby providing high precision with a relatively small set of comparisons.

In hypercubic quantization applying a suitable (random or learned) rotation after dimensionality reduction has been experimentally shown to improve the results accuracy in the nearest neighbors search problem. We prove in this paper that the use of these rotations is optimal under some mild assumptions getting optimal binary sketches is equivalent to applying a rotation uniformizing the diagonal of the covariance matrix between data points. Moreover for two closed points the probability to have dissimilar binary sketches is upper bounded by a factor of the initial distance between the data points. Relaxing these assumptions we obtain a general concentration result for random matrices.

	<td><p>In this paper we propose a novel regularization method for Generative Adversarial Networks which allows the model to learn discriminative yet compact binary representations of image patches (image descriptors). We employ the dimensionality reduction that takes place in the intermediate layers of the discriminator network and train binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer to mimic the distribution of the higher-dimensional preceding layers. To achieve this we introduce two loss terms that aim at (i) reducing the correlation between the dimensions of the binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer i. e. maximizing joint entropy) and (ii) propagating the relations between the dimensions in the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional space. We evaluate the resulting binary image descriptors on two challenging applications image matching and retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art results.</p>

	<td><p>Learning compact binary codes for image retrieval task using deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention recently. However training deep hashing networks for the task is challenging due to the binary constraints on the hash codes the similarity preserving property and the requirement for a vast amount of labelled images. To the best of our knowledge none of the existing methods has tackled all of these challenges completely in a unified framework. In this work we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for the task in which the network is trained to produce binary codes directly from image pixels without the need of manual annotation. In particular to deal with the non-smoothness of binary constraints we propose a novel pairwise constrained loss function which simultaneously encodes the distances between pairs of hash codes and the binary quantization error. In order to train the network with the proposed loss function we propose an efficient parameter learning algorithm. In addition to provide similar / dissimilar training images to train the network we exploit 3D models reconstructed from unlabelled images for automatic generation of enormous training image pairs. The extensive experiments on image retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art compact representation methods on the image retrieval problem.</p>

	<td><p>In the large-scale image retrieval task the two most important requirements are the discriminability of image representations and the efficiency in computation and storage of representations. Regarding the former requirement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proven to be a very powerful tool to extract highly discriminative local descriptors for effective image search. Additionally in order to further improve the discriminative power of the descriptors recent works adopt fine-tuned strategies. In this paper taking a different approach we propose a novel computationally efficient and competitive framework. Specifically we firstly propose various strategies to compute masks namely SIFT-mask SUM-mask and MAX-mask to select a representative subset of local convolutional features and eliminate redundant features. Our in-depth analyses demonstrate that proposed masking schemes are effective to address the burstiness drawback and improve retrieval accuracy. Secondly we propose to employ recent embedding and aggregating methods which can significantly boost the feature discriminability. Regarding the computation and storage efficiency we include a hashing module to produce very compact binary image representations. Extensive experiments on six image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval performances.</p>

	<td><p>The research on hashing techniques for visual data is gaining increased attention in recent years due to the need for compact representations supporting efficient search/retrieval in large-scale databases such as online images. Among many possibilities Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring shortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and utilization of hash codes pushing a system to attain higher mAP will inevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of the hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples in the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not necessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper we introduce a new metric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation of the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a retrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash codes leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than conventional ones like mAP. To this end we start by mathematical analysis of the deficiencies of mAP for hashing-based retrieval. We then propose mLGAP and show why it is more appropriate for hashing-based retrieval. Experiments on image retrieval are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric.</p>

Despite its potential impact in industrial contexts low performances and lack of scalability have prevented such systems from being adopted in practice for large applications. In this work we investigate whether textual music information (such as metadata and lyrics) can be used along with audio for large-scale cover identification problem in a wide digital music library. We benchmark this problem using standard text and state of the art audio similarity measures. Our studies shows that these methods can significantly increase the accuracy and scalability of cover detection systems on Million Song Dataset (MSD) and Second Hand Song (SHS) datasets. By only leveraging standard tf-idf based text similarity measures on song titles and lyrics we achieved 35.5 of absolute increase in mean average precision compared to the current scalable audio content-based state of the art methods on MSD. These experimental results suggests that new methodologies can be encouraged among researchers to leverage and identify more sophisticated NLP-based techniques to improve current cover song identification systems in digital music libraries with metadata.</p>

	<td><p>The recent advances in deep neural networks have demonstrated high capability in a wide variety of scenarios. Nevertheless, fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses, i.e., triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks, including cross-domain digits retrieval, image to image and image to video transfers, on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

We show theoretically and empirically that this new family of hash functions is locality-sensitive and preserves rank similarity for inputs in any `p space. We then analyze different variations on this strategy and show empirically that they outperform existing LSH methods for nearest-neighbors search on six benchmark datasets.

Intuitively object semantics can help build the index that focuses on the most relevant regions. However due to the lack of bounding-box datasets for objects of interest among retrieval benchmarks most recent work on regional representations has focused on either uniform or class-agnostic region selection. In this paper we first fill the void by providing a new dataset of landmark bounding boxes based on the Google Landmarks dataset that includes 86k images with manually curated boxes from 15k unique landmarks. Then we demonstrate how a trained landmark detector using our new dataset can be leveraged to index image regions and improve retrieval accuracy while being much more efficient than existing regional methods. In addition we introduce a novel regional aggregated selective match kernel (R-ASMK) to effectively combine information from detected regions into an improved holistic image representation. R-ASMK boosts image retrieval accuracy substantially with no dimensionality increase while even outperforming systems that index image regions independently. Our complete image retrieval system improves upon the previous state-of-the-art by significant margins on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

	<td><p>We propose a deep hashing framework for sketch retrieval that for the first time works on a multi-million scale human sketch dataset. Leveraging on this large dataset we explore a few sketch-specific traits that were otherwise under-studied in prior literature. Instead of following the conventional sketch recognition task we introduce the novel problem of sketch hashing retrieval which is not only more challenging but also offers a better testbed for large-scale sketch analysis since (i) more fine-grained sketch feature learning is required to accommodate the large variations in style and abstraction and (ii) a compact binary code needs to be learned at the same time to enable efficient retrieval. Key to our network design is the embedding of unique characteristics of human sketch where (i) a two-branch CNN-RNN architecture is adapted to explore the temporal ordering of strokes and (ii) a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the temporal and abstract traits of sketches. By working with a 3.8M sketch dataset we show that state-of-the-art hashing models specifically engineered for static images fail to perform well on temporal sketch data. Our network on the other hand not only offers the best retrieval performance on various code sizes but also yields the best generalization performance under a zero-shot setting and when re-purposed for sketch recognition. Such superior performances effectively demonstrate the benefit of our sketch-specific design.</p>

address the discrete optimization problem in hashing learning. The discrete optimization introduced by binary constraint is an NP-hard mixed integer programming problem.
It is usually addressed by relaxing the binary variables into
continuous variables to adapt to the gradient based learning of hashing functions, especially the training of deep
neural networks. To deal with the objective discrepancy
caused by relaxation, we transform the original binary optimization into differentiable optimization problem over hash
functions through series expansion. This transformation decouples the binary constraint and the similarity preserving
hashing function optimization. The transformed objective

However most of the previous works treat the triplets equally or select the hard triplets based on the loss. Such strategies do not consider the order relations which is important for retrieval task. To this end we propose an order-aware reweighting method to effectively train the triplet-based deep networks which up-weights the important triplets and down-weights the uninformative triplets. First we present the order-aware weighting factors to indicate the importance of the triplets which depend on the rank order of binary codes.

Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Given a set of points Xsubset ^d and a pairwise function w^dtimes ^dto 01 we study the problem of designing a data-structure that enables sublinear-time approximation of the summation Z_w(y)=Xsum_xin Xw(xy) for any query yin ^d. By combining ideas from Harmonic Analysis (partitions of unity and approximation theory) with Hashing-Based-Estimators Charikar Siminelakis FOCS17 we provide a general framework for designing such data structures through hashing that reaches far beyond what previous techniques allowed. A key design principle is a collection of Tgeq 1 hashing schemes with collision probabilities p_1ldots p_T such that sup_tin Tp_t(xy) = Theta(). This leads to a data-structure that approximates Z_w(y) using a sub-linear number of samples from each hash family. Using this new framework along with Distance Sensitive Hashing Aumuller Christiani Pagh Silvestri PODS18 we show that such a collection can be constructed and evaluated efficiently for any log-convex function w(xy)=e^phi(langle xyrangle) of the inner product on the unit sphere xyin ^d-1. Our method leads to data structures with sub-linear query time that significantly improve upon random sampling and can be used for Kernel Density or Partition Function Estimation.

	<td><p>Maintaining the pair similarity relationship among originally high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional binary space is a popular strategy to learn binary codes. One simiple and intutive method is to utilize two identical code matrices produced by hash functions to approximate a pairwise real label matrix. However the resulting quartic problem is difficult to directly solve due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the objective. In this paper unlike previous optimization methods using various relaxation strategies we aim to directly solve the original quartic problem using a novel alternative optimization mechanism to linearize the quartic problem by introducing a linear regression model. Additionally we find that gradually learning each batch of binary codes in a sequential mode i.e. batch by batch is greatly beneficial to the convergence of binary code learning. Based on this significant discovery and the proposed strategy we introduce a scalable symmetric discrete hashing algorithm that gradually and smoothly updates each batch of binary codes. To further improve the smoothness we also propose a greedy symmetric discrete hashing algorithm to update each bit of batch binary codes. Moreover we extend the proposed optimization mechanism to solve the non-convex optimization problems for binary code learning in many other pairwise based hashing algorithms. Extensive experiments on benchmark single-label and multi-label databases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed mechanism over recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

However none of the existing works uses hashing to address texture image retrieval mostly because of the lack of sufficiently large texture image databases. Our work addresses this problem by developing a novel deep learning architecture that generates binary hash codes for input texture images. For this we first pre-train a Texture Synthesis Network (TSN) which takes a texture patch as input and outputs an enlarged view of the texture by injecting newer texture content. Thus it signifies that the TSN encodes the learnt texture specific information in its intermediate layers. In the next stage a second network gathers the multi-scale feature representations from the TSNs intermediate layers using channel-wise attention combines them in a progressive manner to a dense continuous representation which is finally converted into a binary hash code with the help of individual and pairwise label information. The new enlarged texture patches also help in data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient texture data and are used to train the second stage of the network. Experiments on three public texture image retrieval datasets indicate the superiority of our texture synthesis guided hashing approach over current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

To overcome this weakness we propose a novel diffusion technique in this paper. In our work instead of applying diffusion to the query we pre-compute the diffusion results of each element in the database making the online search a simple linear combination on top of the k-NN search process. Our proposed method becomes 10~ times faster in terms of online search speed. Moreover we propose to use late truncation instead of early truncation in previous works to achieve better retrieval performance.</p>

	<td><p>Nearest neighbor search and k-nearest neighbor graph construction are two fundamental issues arise from many disciplines such as multimedia information retrieval data-mining and machine learning. They become more and more imminent given the big data emerge in various fields in recent years. In this paper a simple but effective solution both for approximate k-nearest neighbor search and approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is presented. These two issues are addressed jointly in our solution. On the one hand the approximate k-nearest neighbor graph construction is treated as a search task. Each sample along with its k-nearest neighbors are joined into the k-nearest neighbor graph by performing the nearest neighbor search sequentially on the graph under construction. On the other hand the built k-nearest neighbor graph is used to support k-nearest neighbor search. Since the graph is built online the dynamic update on the graph which is not possible from most of the existing solutions is supported. This solution is feasible for various distance measures. Its effectiveness both as k-nearest neighbor construction and k-nearest neighbor search approaches is verified across different types of data in different scales various dimensions and under different metrics.</p>

We show that the LSHablility of the most commonly analyzed set similarities is in one-to-one correspondance with the supermodularity of these similarities when taken with respect to the symmetric difference of their arguments. We find that the supermodularity of equivalent LSHable similarities can be dependent on the set encoding. While monotonicity and supermodularity does not imply the metric condition necessary for supermodularity this condition is guaranteed for the more restricted class of supermodular Hamming similarities that we introduce. We show moreover that LSH preserving transformations are also supermodular-preserving yielding a way to generate families of similarities both LSHable and supermodular. Finally we show that even the more restricted family of cardinality-based supermodular Hamming similarities presents promising aspects for the study of the link between LSHability and supermodularity. We hope that the several bridges that we introduce between LSHability and supermodularity paves the way to a better understanding both of supermodular analysis and LSHability notably in the context of large-scale supermodular optimization.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we have proposed a novel feature descriptors combining color and texture information collectively. In our proposed color descriptor component the inter-channel relationship between Hue (H) and Saturation (S) channels in the HSV color space has been explored which was not done earlier. We have quantized the H channel into a number of bins and performed the voting with saturation values and vice versa by following a principle similar to that of the HOG descriptor where orientation of the gradient is quantized into a certain number of bins and voting is done with gradient magnitude. This helps us to study the nature of variation of saturation with variation in Hue and nature of variation of Hue with the variation in saturation. The texture component of our descriptor considers the co-occurrence relationship between the pixels symmetric about both the diagonals of a 3x3 window. Our work is inspired from the work done by Dubey et al.1. These two components viz. color and texture information individually perform better than existing texture and color descriptors. Moreover when concatenated the proposed descriptors provide significant improvement over existing descriptors for content base color image retrieval. The proposed descriptor has been tested for image retrieval on five databases including texture image databases - MIT VisTex database and Salzburg texture database and natural scene databases Corel 1K Corel 5K and Corel 10K. The precision and recall values experimented on these databases are compared with some state-of-art local patterns. The proposed method provided satisfactory results from the experiments.</p>

	<td><p>It has been shown in the indexing literature that there is an essential difference between prefix/range searches on the one hand and predecessor/rank searches on the other hand in that the former provably allows faster query resolution. Traditionally prefix search is solved by data structures that are also dictionariesâthey actually contain the strings in S. For very large collections stored in slow-access memory we propose much more compact data structures that support prefix searchesâthey return the ranks of matching strings provided that string in S starts with the given prefix. In fact we show that our most space-efficient data structure is asymptotically space-optimal. Previously data structures such as String B-trees (and more complicated cache-oblivious string data structures) have implicitly supported weak prefix queries but they all have query time that grows logarithmically with the size of the string collection. In contrast our data structures are simple naturally cache-efficient and have query time that depends only on the length of the prefix all the way down to constant query time for strings that fit in one machine word. We give several applications of weak prefix searches including exact prefix counting and approximate counting of tuples matching conjunctive prefix conditions.</p>

Such an embedding does not only improve image retrieval results but could also facilitate integrating semantics for other tasks e.g. novelty detection or few-shot learning. We introduce a deterministic algorithm for computing the class centroids directly based on prior world-knowledge encoded in a hierarchy of classes such as WordNet.

The state-of-the-art retrieval systems for billion-scale databases are currently based on the inverted multi-index the recently proposed generalization of the inverted index structure. The multi-index provides a very fine-grained partition of the feature space that allows extracting concise and accurate short-lists of candidates for the search queries. In this paper we argue that the potential of the simple inverted index was not fully exploited in previous works and advocate its usage both for the highly-entangled deep descriptors and relatively disentangled SIFT descriptors. We introduce a new retrieval system that is based on the inverted index and outperforms the multi-index by a large margin for the same memory consumption and construction complexity. For example our system achieves the state-of-the-art recall rates several times faster on the dataset of one billion deep descriptors compared to the efficient implementation of the inverted multi-index from the FAISS library.</p>

performance, typically under the semantic supervision. In contrast, current unsupervised deep hashing algorithms can hardly achieve
satisfactory performance due to either the relaxed optimization or absence of similarity-sensitive objective. In this work, we propose a
simple yet effective unsupervised hashing framework, named Similarity-Adaptive Deep Hashing (SADH), which alternatingly proceeds
over three training modules: deep hash model training, similarity graph updating and binary code optimization. The key difference from
the widely-used two-step hashing method is that the output representations of the learned deep model help update the similarity graph
matrix, which is then used to improve the subsequent code optimization. In addition, for producing high-quality binary codes, we devise
an effective discrete optimization algorithm which can directly handle the binary constraints with a general hashing loss. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of SADH, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large gaps.</p>

Traditional fuzzy hash functions are data agnostic they do not learn from a particular dataset how to determine similarity; their behavior is fixed across all datasets. In this paper we demonstrate that fuzzy hash functions can be learned in a novel minimax training framework and that these learned fuzzy hash functions outperform traditional fuzzy hash functions at the file similarity task for Portable Executable files. In our approach hash digests can be extracted from the kernel embeddings of two kernel networks trained in a minimax framework where the roles of players during training (i.e adversary versus generator) alternate along with the input data. We refer to this new minimax architecture as perturbation-consistent. The similarity score for a pair of files is the utility of the minimax game in equilibrium. Our experiments show that learned fuzzy hash functions generalize well capable of determining that two files are similar even when one of those files was generated using insertion and deletion operations.</p>

However with a large vocabulary and many dimensions these floating-point representations are expensive both in terms of memory and calculations which makes them unsuitable for use on low-resource devices. The method proposed in this paper transforms real-valued embeddings into binary embeddings while preserving semantic information requiring only 128 or 256 bits for each vector. This leads to a small memory footprint and fast vector operations. The model is based on an autoencoder architecture which also allows to reconstruct original vectors from the binary ones. Experimental results on semantic similarity text classification and sentiment analysis tasks show that the binarization of word embeddings only leads to a loss of ~2 in accuracy while vector size is reduced by 97. Furthermore a top-k benchmark demonstrates that using these binary vectors is 30 times faster than using real-valued vectors.</p>

Our proposed approach employs adversarial training scheme to lean a couple of hash functions enabling translation between modalities while assuming the underlying semantic relationship. To induce the hash codes with semantics to the input-output pair cycle consistency loss is further proposed upon the adversarial training to strengthen the correlations between inputs and corresponding outputs. Our approach is generative to learn hash functions such that the learned hash codes can maximally correlate each input-output correspondence meanwhile can also regenerate the inputs so as to minimize the information loss. The learning to hash embedding is thus performed to jointly optimize the parameters of the hash functions across modalities as well as the associated generative models.

	<td><p>Recently hashing techniques have gained importance in large-scale retrieval tasks because of their retrieval speed. Most of the existing cross-view frameworks assume that data are well paired. However the fully-paired multiview situation is not universal in real applications. The aim of the method proposed in this paper is to learn the hashing function for semi-paired cross-view retrieval tasks. To utilize the label information of partial data we propose a semi-supervised hashing learning framework which jointly performs feature extraction and classifier learning. The experimental results on two datasets show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy.</p>

	<td><p>Deep supervised hashing has emerged as an influential solution to large-scale semantic image retrieval problems in computer vision. In the light of recent progress convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning. However complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by similar/dissimilar labels which limits the retrieval performance. Generally pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard we propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code. Specifically a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian distribution is proposed which preserves semantic variations while penalizes the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes a two-step optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Moreover when training samples are limited our method surpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins.</p>

deep hashing has become one of the most promising solutions, and achieved attractive performance

an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel
progressive generative hashing (PGH) framework
to help learn a discriminative hashing network in an
unsupervised way. Different from existing studies,
it first treats the hash codes as a kind of semantic
condition for the similar image generation, and simultaneously feeds the original image and its codes
into the generative adversarial networks (GANs).
The real images together with the synthetic ones
can further help train a discriminative hashing network based on a triplet loss. By iteratively inputting
the learnt codes into the hash conditioned GANs, we can progressively enable the hashing network
to discover the semantic relations. Extensive experiments on the widely-used image datasets demonstrate that PGH can significantly outperform stateof-the-art unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

First we devise a novel minutia-based local structure modeled by a mixture of 2D elliptical Gaussian functions in the pixel space. Each local structure is mapped to the Euclidean space by normalizing the local structure with the number of minutiae that associates to it. This simple yet crucial crux enables fast dissimilarity computation of two local structures with Euclidean distance without distortion. A complementary texture-based local structure to the minutia-based local structure is also introduced whereby both can be compressed via principal component analysis and fused easily in the Euclidean space. The fused local structure is then converted to a K-bit ordered string via a K-means clustering algorithm. This chain of computation with sole use of Euclidean distance is vital for speedy and discriminative bit-string conversion. The accuracy can be further improved by a finger-specific bit-training algorithm in which two criteria are leveraged to select useful bit positions for matching. Experiments are performed on Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC) databases for comparison with existing techniques to show the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

The first architecture performs semantic analysis in the encoding process by reserving a portion of the bits from the compressed code to store the semantic representations.

However the existing general hashing methods have limited discriminative power for describing fine-grained objects that share similar overall appearance but have subtle difference. To solve this problem we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to the learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically we propose a novel deep hashing model named deep saliency hashing (DSaH) which automatically mines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes simultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic components including the semantic loss the saliency loss and the quantization loss. As the core of DSaH the saliency loss guides the attention network to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images. We conduct extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets including Oxford Flowers-17 Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird demonstrate that our DSaH performs the best for fine-grained retrieval task and beats the strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10 on both Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird.

We enforce four criteria on hashing codes learning based on VGG-19 model 1) preserving relevant information of feature space in hashing space; 2) minimizing quantization loss between binary-like codes and hashing codes; 3) improving the usage of each bit in hashing codes by using maximum information entropy and 4) invariant to image rotation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 NUSWIDE have demonstrated that outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval.

	<td><p>Image similarity measures play an important role in nearest neighbor search and duplicate detection for large-scale image datasets. Recently Minwise Hashing (or Minhash) and its related hashing algorithms have achieved great performances in large-scale image retrieval systems. However there are a large number of comparisons for image pairs in these applications which may spend a lot of computation time and affect the performance. In order to quickly obtain the pairwise images that theirs similarities are higher than the specific threshold T (e.g. 0.5) we propose a dynamic threshold filter of Minwise Hashing for image similarity measures. It greatly reduces the calculation time by terminating the unnecessary comparisons in advance. We also find that the filter can be extended to other hashing algorithms on when the estimator satisfies the binomial distribution such as b-Bit Minwise Hashing One Permutation Hashing etc. In this pager we use the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model based on the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to represent the image features. We have proved that the filter is correct and effective through the experiment on real image datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Embedding representation learning via neural networks is at the core foundation of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in developing algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for search efficiency this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per each query and trades off the search accuracy through binarization. To this end we consider the problem of directly learning a quantizable embedding representation and the sparse binary hash code end-to-end which can be used to construct an efficient hash table not only providing significant search reduction in the number of data but also achieving the state of the art search accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep metric learning methods. We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash code in a mini-batch can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum cost flow problem. Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to 98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search.

Existing efforts mainly focus on single-modal retrieval task especially Image-Based Image Retrieval (IBIR). However as a highlighted research topic in the field of hashing cross-modal retrieval is more common in real world applications. To address the Cross-Modal Zero-Shot Hashing (CMZSH) retrieval task we propose a novel Attribute-Guided Network (AgNet) which can perform not only IBIR but also Text-Based Image Retrieval (TBIR). In particular AgNet aligns different modal data into a semantically rich attribute space which bridges the gap caused by modality heterogeneity and zero-shot setting. We also design an effective strategy that exploits the attribute to guide the generation of hash codes for image and text within the same network. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (AwA SUN and ImageNet) demonstrate the superiority of AgNet on both cross-modal and single-modal zero-shot image retrieval tasks.</p>

However in large-scale real-world scenarios the exact similarity computation has become daunting due to 3V nature (volume velocity and variety) of big data. In such cases the hashing techniques have been verified to efficiently conduct similarity estimation in terms of both theory and practice. Currently MinHash is a popular technique for efficiently estimating the Jaccard similarity of binary sets and furthermore weighted MinHash is generalized to estimate the generalized Jaccard similarity of weighted sets. This review focuses on categorizing and discussing the existing works of weighted MinHash algorithms. In this review we mainly categorize the Weighted MinHash algorithms into quantization-based approaches active index-based ones and others and show the evolution and inherent connection of the weighted MinHash algorithms from the integer weighted MinHash algorithms to real-valued weighted MinHash ones (particularly the Consistent Weighted Sampling scheme). Also we have developed a python toolbox for the algorithms and released it in our github. Based on the toolbox we experimentally conduct a comprehensive comparative study of the standard MinHash algorithm and the weighted MinHash ones.</p>

We cast the task of multimedia indexing as a gist understanding problem. Our pipeline benefits from external knowledge and two subsequent learning- to-rank (l2r) settings. The first l2r produces a ranking of concepts rep- resenting the respective multimedia instance. The second l2r produces a mapping between the concept representation of an instance and the targeted class topic(s) for the multimedia indexing task. The evaluation on an established big size corpus (MIRFlickr25k with 25000 images) shows that multimedia indexing benefits from understanding the gist. Finally with a MAP of 61.42 it can be shown that the multimedia in- dexing task benefits from understanding the gist.

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have received much attention recently which achieve promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks. However most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of hashing functions independently while ignore the correlations between different hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly. Inspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning we propose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH). Our proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential decision process which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors imposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep reinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed DRLIH approach can be summarized as follows (1) We propose a deep reinforcement learning hashing network. In the proposed network we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) as agents to model the hashing functions which take actions of projecting images into binary codes sequentially so that the current hashing function learning can take previous hashing functions error into account. (2) We propose a sequential learning strategy based on proposed DRLIH. We define the state as a tuple of internal features of RNNs hidden layers and image features which can reflect history decisions made by the agents. We also propose an action group method to enhance the correlation of hash functions in the same group. Experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DRLIH approach.</p>

First we introduce a neural net compression scheme based on random linear sketching (which is usually implemented efficiently via hashing) and show that the sketched (smaller) network is able to approximate the original network on all input data coming from any smooth and well-conditioned low-dimensional manifold. The sketched network can also be trained directly via back-propagation.

Nevertheless existing approaches could hardly guarantee a satisfactory performance with the extremely low-bit (e.g. 4-bit) hash codes due to the severe information loss and the shrink of the discrete solution space. In this paper we propose a novel strategy that is tailored for generating high-quality low-bit hash codes. The core idea is to jointly distill bit-specific and informative representations for a group of pre-defined code lengths. The learning of short hash codes among the group can benefit from the manifold shared with other long codes where multiple views from different hash codes provide the supplementary guidance and regularization making the convergence faster and more stable. To achieve that an asymmetric hashing framework with two variants of multi-head embedding structures is derived termed as Multi-head Asymmetric Hashing (MAH) leading to great efficiency of training and querying. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed MAH and have shown that the 8-bit hash codes generated by MAH achieve 94.3 of the MAP (Mean Average Precision (MAP)) score on the CIFAR-10 dataset which significantly surpasses the performance of the 48-bit codes by the state-of-the-arts in image retrieval tasks.</p>

common limitations of existing methods. First, most pioneer methods discretely learn hash codes bit by bit, making the learning
procedure rather time-consuming. Second, to reduce the large complexity of the n by n pairwise similarity matrix, most methods apply
sampling strategies during training, which inevitably results in information loss and suboptimal performance; some recent methods
try to replace the large matrix with a smaller one, but the size is
still large. Third, among the methods that leverage the pairwise
similarity matrix, most of them only encode the semantic label
information in learning the hash codes, failing to fully capture
the characteristics of data. In this paper, we present a novel supervised hashing method, called Fast Scalable Supervised Hashing
(FSSH), which circumvents the use of the large similarity matrix by
introducing a pre-computed intermediate term whose size is independent with the size of training data. Moreover, FSSH can learn
the hash codes with not only the semantic information but also
the features of data. Extensive experiments on three widely used

Many hashing methods based on a single view have been extensively studied for information retrieval. However the representation capacity of a single view is insufficient and some discriminative information is not captured which results in limited improvement. In this paper we employ multiple views to represent images and texts for enriching the feature information. Our framework exploits the complementary information among multiple views to better learn the discriminative compact hash codes. A discrete hashing learning framework that jointly performs classifier learning and subspace learning is proposed to complete multiple search tasks simultaneously. Our framework includes two stages namely a kernelization process and a quantization process. Kernelization aims to find a common subspace where multi-view features can be fused. The quantization stage is designed to learn discriminative unified hashing codes. Extensive experiments are performed on single-label datasets (WiKi and MMED) and multi-label datasets (MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE) and the experimental results indicate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

The idea is to first represent each texture image by its local maximum and local minimum pixels. The image is then divided into regular overlapping blocks and each one is characterized by a feature vector constructed from the radiometric geometric and structural information of its local extrema. All feature vectors are finally embedded into a covariance matrix which will be exploited for dissimilarity measurement within retrieval task. Thanks to the methods simplicity multiscale scheme can be easily implemented to improve its scale-space representation capacity. We argue that our handcrafted features are easy to implement fast to run but can provide very competitive performance compared to handcrafted and CNN-based learned descriptors from the literature.

	<td><p>Existing video hash functions are built on three isolated stages frame pooling relaxed learning and binarization which have not adequately explored the temporal order of video frames in a joint binary optimization model resulting in severe information loss. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised video hashing framework dubbed Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) that is able to capture the temporal nature of videos in an end-to-end learning-to-hash fashion. We specifically address two central problems 1) how to design an encoder-decoder architecture to generate binary codes for videos; and 2) how to equip the binary codes with the ability of accurate video retrieval. We design a hierarchical binary autoencoder to model the temporal dependencies in videos with multiple granularities and embed the videos into binary codes with less computations than the stacked architecture. Then we encourage the binary codes to simultaneously reconstruct the visual content and neighborhood structure of the videos. Experiments on two real-world datasets (FCVID and YFCC) show that our SSVH method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and achieve the currently best performance on the task of unsupervised video retrieval.</p>

However there still remains a crucial bottleneck how to bridge the modality gap to further enhance the retrieval accuracy. In this paper we propose a self-supervised adversarial hashing () approach which lies among the early attempts to incorporate adversarial learning into cross-modal hashing in a self-supervised fashion. The primary contribution of this work is that two adversarial networks are leveraged to maximize the semantic correlation and consistency of the representations between different modalities. In addition we harness a self-supervised semantic network to discover high-level semantic information in the form of multi-label annotations. Such information guides the feature learning process and preserves the modality relationships in both the common semantic space and the Hamming space. Extensive experiments carried out on three benchmark datasets validate that the proposed SSAH surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years, many hashing methods have been proposed for the cross-modal retrieval task. However, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes, which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed, most of them are time-consuming. In addition, most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization, making them unscalable. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing methodâScalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing, SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition, it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm, it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover, the binary codes can be generated discretely, reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely, Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, and NUS-WIDE, have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the impressive learning power deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance in supervised hash function learning. In this paper we propose a novel asymmetric supervised deep hashing method to preserve the semantic structure among different categories and generate the binary codes simultaneously. Specifically two asymmetric deep networks are constructed to reveal the similarity between each pair of images according to their semantic labels. The deep hash functions are then learned through two networks by minimizing the gap between the learned features and discrete codes. Furthermore since the binary codes in the Hamming space also should keep the semantic affinity existing in the original space another asymmetric pairwise loss is introduced to capture the similarity between the binary codes and real-value features. This asymmetric loss not only improves the retrieval performance but also contributes to a quick convergence at the training phase. By taking advantage of the two-stream deep structures and two types of asymmetric pairwise functions an alternating algorithm is designed to optimize the deep features and high-quality binary codes efficiently. Experimental results on three real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach as compared with state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed. Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable. However such unified or equal-length hash representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths. To mitigate these problems this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios. To this end a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH) is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios. More specifically MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn the modality-specific hash codes with different length settings while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices to semantically correlate the different hash representations for heterogeneous data comparable. As a result the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.</p>

In this work we focus on the exploitation of the discriminative information from different views and propose an end-to-end method to learn semantic-preserving and discriminative binary representation dubbed Discriminative Cross-View Hashing (DCVH) in light of learning multitasking binary representation for various tasks including cross-view retrieval image-to-image retrieval and image annotation/tagging. The proposed DCVH has the following key components. First it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) based nonlinear hashing functions and multilabel classification for both images and texts simultaneously. Such hashing functions achieve effective continuous relaxation during training without explicit quantization loss by using Direct Binary Embedding (DBE) layers. Second we propose an effective view alignment via Hamming distance minimization which is efficiently accomplished by bit-wise XOR operation. Extensive experiments on two image-text benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCVH outperforms state-of-the-art cross-view hashing algorithms as well as single-view image hashing algorithms. In addition DCVH can provide competitive performance for image annotation/tagging.</p>

To obtain better precision most studies focus on designing different objective functions with different constraints or penalty terms that consider neighborhood information. In this paper in contrast to existing hashing methods we propose a novel generalized framework called fusion hashing (FH) to improve the precision of existing hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed FH given an existing hashing method we first execute it several times to get several different hash codes for a set of training samples. We then propose two novel fusion strategies that combine these different hash codes into one set of final hash codes. Based on the final hash codes we learn a simple linear hash function for the samples that can significantly improve model precision. In general the proposed FH can be adopted in existing hashing method and achieve more precise and stable performance compared to the original hashing method with little extra expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments were performed based on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework</p>

As part of the development we propose a novel vector to string encoding method which is shown to substantially outperform the previous ones in terms of both precision and latency.

	<td><p>In social networks heterogeneous multimedia data correlate to each other such as videos and their corresponding tags in YouTube and image-text pairs in Facebook. Nearest neighbor retrieval across multiple modalities on large data sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an efficient solution since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise XOR operations can be fast handled the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing code length becomes longer the retrieval performance improvement becomes slower. In this paper we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR) for multimodal hashing. First the sigmoid function is used to embed the data matrices. Then the MCR is applied on the output of sigmoid function. As the output of sigmoid function approximates a binary code matrix the proposed MCR can efficiently decorrelate the hashing codes. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed method becomes greater as the code length increases.</p>

Our method well utilizes the sparse occupancy of 3D shape boundary and builds hierarchical hash tables for an input model under different resolutions. Based on this data structure we design two efficient GPU algorithms namely hash2col and col2hash so that the CNN operations like convolution and pooling can be efficiently parallelized. The spatial hashing is nearly minimal and our data structure is almost of the same size as the raw input. Compared with state-of-the-art octree-based methods our data structure significantly reduces the memory footprint during the CNN training. As the input geometry features are more compactly packed CNN operations also run faster with our data structure. The experiment shows that under the same network structure our method yields comparable or better benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-art while it has only one-third memory consumption. Such superior memory performance allows the CNN to handle high-resolution shape analysis.</p>

Considering the difficulty in obtaining labeled datasets for image retrieval task in large scale we propose a novel CNN-based unsupervised hashing method namely Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH). The unsupervised hashing network is designed under the following three principles 1) more discriminative representations for image retrieval; 2) minimum quantization loss between the original real-valued feature descriptors and the learned hash codes; 3) maximum information entropy for the learned hash codes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 MNIST and In-shop datasets have shown that UTH outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods in terms of retrieval accuracy.</p>

None of the traditionally used hash tables have this property. We show how known approaches like linear probing and bucket cuckoo hashing can be adapted to this scenario by subdividing them into many subtables or using virtual memory overcommitting. However these rather straightforward solutions suffer from slow amortized insertion times due to frequent reallocation in small increments. Our main result is DySECT (bf Dynamic bf Space bf Efficient bf Cuckoo bf Table) which avoids these problems. DySECT consists of many subtables which grow by doubling their size. The resulting inhomogeneity in subtable sizes is equalized by the flexibility available in bucket cuckoo hashing where each element can go to several buckets each of which containing several cells. Experiments indicate that DySECT works well with load factors up to 98. With up to 2.7 times better performance than the next best solution.</p>

Second texts in these datasets are written in well-organized language leading to inconsistency with realistic applications. To overcome these drawbacks the proposed Twitter100k dataset is characterized by two aspects 1) it has 100000 image-text pairs randomly crawled from Twitter and thus has no constraint in the image categories; 2) text in Twitter100k is written in informal language by the users. Since strongly supervised methods leverage the class labels that may be missing in practice this paper focuses on weakly supervised learning for cross-media retrieval in which only text-image pairs are exploited during training. We extensively benchmark the performance of four subspace learning methods and three variants of the Correspondence AutoEncoder along with various text features on Wikipedia Flickr30k and Twitter100k. Novel insights are provided. As a minor contribution inspired by the characteristic of Twitter100k we propose an OCR-based cross-media retrieval method.

	<td><p>Recently supervised hashing methods have attracted much attention since they can optimize retrieval speed and storage cost while preserving semantic information. Because hashing codes learning is NP-hard many methods resort to some form of relaxation technique. But the performance of these methods can easily deteriorate due to the relaxation. Luckily many supervised hashing formulations can be viewed as energy functions hence solving hashing codes is equivalent to learning marginals in the corresponding conditional random field (CRF). By minimizing the KL divergence between a fully factorized distribution and the Gibbs distribution of this CRF a set of consistency equations can be obtained but updating them in parallel may not yield a local optimum since the variational lower bound is not guaranteed to increase. In this paper we use a linear approximation of the sigmoid function to convert these consistency equations to linear systems which have a closed-form solution. By applying this novel technique to two classical hashing formulations KSH and SPLH we obtain two new methods called EM (energy minimizing based)-KSH and EM-SPLH. Experimental results on three datasets show the superiority of our methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hash codes are efficient data representations for coping with the ever growing amounts of data. In this paper we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests with near-optimal information-theoretic code aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme where random trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 for the visited tree leaf and </code>0 for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class distance for the two random class groups. Finally we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets while performing at the level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while utilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation. This work proposes a principled and robust procedure to train and deploy in parallel an ensemble of light-weight CNNs instead of simply going deeper.</p>

Recently, several deep supervised hashing methods have been proposed to learn hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity with deep convolutional neural networks. However, these triplet label based methods try to preserve the ranking order of images according to their similarity degrees to the queries while not putting direct constraints on the distance between the codes of very similar images. Besides, the current evaluation criteria are not able to measure the performance of existing hashing methods on preserving fine-grained multilevel semantic similarity. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Deep Multilevel Semantic Similarity Preserving Hashing (DMSSPH) method to learn compact similarity-preserving binary codes for the huge body of multi-label image data with deep convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we make the best of the supervised information in the form of pairwise labels to maximize the discriminability of output binary codes. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods at the accuracies of top returned images, especially for shorter binary codes. Meanwhile, the proposed method shows better performance on preserving fine-grained multilevel semantic similarity according to the results under the Jaccard coefficient based evaluation criteria we propose.</p>

First to support multiple aspects of semantic object specification (category instance and attribute) we propose a multitask CNN feature that allows us to use deep learning technique and to jointly handle multi-aspect object specification. Second to help users specify spatial relationships among objects in an intuitive way we propose recommendation techniques of spatial relationships. In particular by mining the search results a system can recommend feasible spatial relationships among the objects. The system also can recommend likely spatial relationships by assigned object category names based on language prior.

In hash embeddings each token is represented by k d-dimensional embeddings vectors and one k dimensional weight vector. The final d dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of B embedding vectors. Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.</p>

Particularly, ranking-based hashing techniques have recently attracted broad research attention because ranking accuracy among the retrieved data is well explored and their objective is more applicable to realistic search tasks. However, directly optimizing discrete hash codes without continuous-relaxations on a nonlinear ranking objective is infeasible by either traditional optimization methods or even recent discrete hashing algorithms. To address this challenging issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised hashing method, dubbed Discrete Semantic Ranking Hashing (DSeRH), which aims to directly embed semantic rank orders into binary codes. In DSeRH, a generalized Adaptive Discrete Minimization (ADM) approach is proposed to discretely optimize binary codes with the quadratic nonlinear ranking objective in an iterative manner and is guaranteed to converge quickly. Additionally, instead of using 0/1 independent labels to form rank orders as in previous works, we generate the listwise rank orders from the high-level semantic word embeddings which can quantitatively capture the intrinsic correlation between different categories. We evaluate our DSeRH, coupled with both linear and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) hash functions, on three image datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, SUN397 and ImageNet100, and the results manifest that DSeRH can outperform the state-of-the-art ranking-based hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the explosive growth of image databases deep hashing which learns compact binary descriptors for images has become critical for fast image retrieval. Many existing deep hashing methods leverage quantization loss defined as distance between the features before and after quantization to reduce the error from binarizing features. While minimizing the quantization loss guarantees that quantization has minimal effect on retrieval accuracy it unfortunately significantly reduces the expressiveness of features even before the quantization. In this paper we show that the above definition of quantization loss is too restricted and in fact not necessary for maintaining high retrieval accuracy. We therefore propose a new form of quantization loss measured in triplets. The core idea of the triplet quantization loss is to learn discriminative real-valued descriptors which lead to minimal loss on retrieval accuracy after quantization. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark data sets of different scales CIFAR-10 and In-shop demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. Moreover we show that the compact binary descriptors obtained with triplet quantization loss lead to very small performance drop after quantization.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. Unsupervised cross-modal hashing is more flexible and applicable than supervised methods since no intensive labeling work is involved. However existing unsupervised methods learn hashing functions by preserving inter and intra correlations while ignoring the underlying manifold structure across different modalities which is extremely helpful to capture meaningful nearest neighbors of different modalities for cross-modal retrieval. To address the above problem in this paper we propose an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Cross-modal Hashing approach (UGACH) which makes full use of GANs ability for unsupervised representation learning to exploit the underlying manifold structure of cross-modal data. The main contributions can be summarized as follows (1) We propose a generative adversarial network to model cross-modal hashing in an unsupervised fashion. In the proposed UGACH given a data of one modality the generative model tries to fit the distribution over the manifold structure and select informative data of another modality to challenge the discriminative model. The discriminative model learns to distinguish the generated data and the true positive data sampled from correlation graph to achieve better retrieval accuracy. These two models are trained in an adversarial way to improve each other and promote hashing function learning. (2) We propose a correlation graph based approach to capture the underlying manifold structure across different modalities so that data of different modalities but within the same manifold can have smaller Hamming distance and promote retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest
neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can
lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of annotating
data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing
to a new domain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the
robustness problem as the data at training and test stage
may come from different distributions. This paper studies
the exploration of generating synthetic data through semisupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which
leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data
to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance
and global coherence, for better understanding statistical
structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above
two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic
hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented, which mainly
consists of four components: a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary
stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash
stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and
a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained endto-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e., adversarial loss
to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet
ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the
input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify
each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on
both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our
framework also achieves superior results when compared to
state-of-the-art deep hash models.</p>

Consistent Weighted Sampling (CWS) generalizes the Min-Hash scheme to sketch weighted sets and has drawn increasing interest from the community. Due to its constant-time complexity independent of the values of the weights Improved CWS (ICWS) is considered as the state-of-the-art CWS algorithm. In this paper we revisit ICWS and analyze its underlying mechanism to show that there actually exists dependence between the two components of the hash-code produced by ICWS which violates the condition of independence. To remedy the problem we propose an Improved ICWS (I^2CWS) algorithm which not only shares the same theoretical computational complexity as ICWS but also abides by the required conditions of the CWS scheme. The experimental results on a number of synthetic data sets and real-world text data sets demonstrate that our I^2CWS algorithm can estimate the Jaccard similarity more accurately and also compete with or outperform the compared methods including ICWS in classification and top-K retrieval after relieving the underlying dependence.</p>

	<td><p>Multi-index fusion has demonstrated impressive performances in retrieval task by integrating different visual representations in a unified framework. However previous works mainly consider propagating similarities via neighbor structure ignoring the high order information among different visual representations. In this paper we propose a new multi-index fusion scheme for image retrieval. By formulating this procedure as a multilinear based optimization problem the complementary information hidden in different indexes can be explored more thoroughly. Specially we first build our multiple indexes from various visual representations. Then a so-called index-specific functional matrix which aims to propagate similarities is introduced for updating the original index. The functional matrices are then optimized in a unified tensor space to achieve a refinement such that the relevant images can be pushed more closer. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the augmented Lagrangian method with theoretical convergence guarantee. Unlike the traditional multi-index fusion scheme our approach embeds the multi-index subspace structure into the new indexes with sparse constraint thus it has little additional memory consumption in online query stage. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark datasets reveals that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance i.e. N-score 3.94 on UKBench mAP 94.1 on Holiday and 62.39 on Market-1501.</p>

For instance hashtags have the potential to significantly reduce the problem of manual supervision and annotation when learning vision models for a large number of concepts. However a key challenge when learning from hashtags is that they are inherently subjective because they are provided by users as a form of self-expression. As a consequence hashtags may have synonyms (different hashtags referring to the same visual content) and may be ambiguous (the same hashtag referring to different visual content). These challenges limit the effectiveness of approaches that simply treat hashtags as image-label pairs. This paper presents an approach that extends upon modeling simple image-label pairs by modeling the joint distribution of images hashtags and users. We demonstrate the efficacy of such approaches in image tagging and retrieval experiments and show how the joint model can be used to perform user-conditional retrieval and tagging.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing is a fundamental and one of the most successful hashing algorithm in the literature. Recent advances based on the idea of densification~ have shown that it is possible to compute k minwise hashes of a vector with d nonzeros in mere (d + k) computations a significant improvement over the classical O(dk). These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing especially when the data is sparse. In this paper we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal and without losing the runtime efficiency it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice.</p>

In this paper we propose a variant of DCI which we call Prioritized DCI and show a remarkable improvement in the dependence of query time on intrinsic dimensionality. In particular a linear increase in intrinsic dimensionality or equivalently an exponential increase in the number of points near a query can be mostly counteracted with just a linear increase in space. We also demonstrate empirically that Prioritized DCI significantly outperforms prior methods. In particular relative to Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Prioritized DCI reduces the number of distance evaluations by a factor of 14 to 116 and the memory consumption by a factor of 21.</p>

	<td><p>We present the multi-layer extension of the Sparse Ternary Codes (STC) for fast similarity search where we focus on the reconstruction of the database vectors from the ternary codes. To consider the trade-offs between the compactness of the STC and the quality of the reconstructed vectors we study the rate-distortion behavior of these codes under different setups. We show that a single-layer code cannot achieve satisfactory results at high rates. Therefore we extend the concept of STC to multiple layers and design the ML-STC a codebook-free system that successively refines the reconstruction of the residuals of previous layers. While the ML-STC keeps the sparse ternary structure of the single-layer STC and hence is suitable for fast similarity search in large-scale databases we show its superior rate-distortion performance on both model-based synthetic data and public large-scale databases as compared to several binary hashing methods.</p>

However because of the particular challenges of mobile visual search achieving a high recognition bitrate has becomes a consistent target of previous related works. In this paper we propose a few-parameter low-latency and high-accuracy deep hashing approach for constructing binary hash codes for mobile visual search. First we exploit the architecture of the MobileNet model which significantly decreases the latency of deep feature extraction by reducing the number of model parameters while maintaining accuracy. Second we add a hash-like layer into MobileNet to train the model on labeled mobile visual data. Evaluations show that the proposed system can exceed state-of-the-art accuracy performance in terms of the MAP. More importantly the memory consumption is much less than that of other deep learning models. The proposed method requires only 13 MB of memory for the neural network and achieves a MAP of 97.80 on the mobile location recognition dataset used for testing.</p>

Such hash functions have numerous applications but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of v. In the present work we focus on so-called anti-concentration bounds i.e. the upper bounds of left&lt;vx &lt; alpha right. In many applications v is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case the distribution of &lt;vx is also normal and it is easy to approximate left&lt;vx &lt; alpha right. Here we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly we analyze v being a random vector from the unit ball in l_infty and v being a random vector from the unit sphere in l_2. We show optimal up to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions f(x)=&lt;vx. As a consequence of our research we obtain new best results for newline for l_p in high dimensional space for all pin1infty for c=Omega(maxd^1/p). These results improve over those presented in 16. Finally our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~17 who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.</p>

By restricting the input noise variable of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to be binary and conditioned on the features of each input image BGAN can simultaneously learn a binary representation per image and generate an image plausibly similar to the original one. In the proposed framework we address two main problems 1) how to directly generate binary codes without relaxation 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval We resolve these problems by proposing new sign-activation strategy and a loss function steering the learning process which consists of new models for adversarial loss a content loss and a neighborhood structure loss. Experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10 NUSWIDE and Flickr) demonstrate that our BGAN significantly outperforms existing hashing methods by up to 107 in terms of~mAP (See Table tab.res.map.comp) Our anonymous code is available at httpsgithub.com/htconquer/BGAN.</p>

As an extension of image hashing techniques traditional video hashing methods mainly depend on hand-crafted features and transform the real-valued features into binary hash codes. As videos provide far more diverse and complex visual information than images extracting features from videos is much more challenging than that from images. Therefore high-level semantic features to represent videos are needed rather than low-level hand-crafted methods. In this paper a deep convolutional neural network is proposed to extract high-level semantic features and a binary hash function is then integrated into this framework to achieve an end-to-end optimization. Particularly our approach also combines triplet loss function which preserves the relative similarity and difference of videos and classification loss function as the optimization objective. Experiments have been performed on two public datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art video retrieval methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the increasing demand of massive multimodal data storage and organization cross-modal retrieval based on hashing technique has drawn much attention nowadays. It takes the binary codes of one modality as the query to retrieve the relevant hashing codes of another modality. However the existing binary constraint makes it difficult to find the optimal cross-modal hashing function. Most approaches choose to relax the constraint and perform thresholding strategy on the real-value representation instead of directly solving the original objective. In this paper we first provide a concrete analysis about the effectiveness of multimodal networks in preserving the inter- and intra-modal consistency. Based on the analysis we provide a so-called Deep Binary Reconstruction (DBRC) network that can directly learn the binary hashing codes in an unsupervised fashion. The superiority comes from a proposed simple but efficient activation function named as Adaptive Tanh (ATanh). The ATanh function can adaptively learn the binary codes and be trained via back-propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DBRC outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both image2text and text2image retrieval task.</p>

	<td><p>Learning compact binary codes for image retrieval problem using deep neural networks has recently attracted increasing attention. However training deep hashing networks is challenging due to the binary constraints on the hash codes. In this paper we propose deep network models and learning algorithms for learning binary hash codes given image representations under both unsupervised and supervised manners. The novelty of our network design is that we constrain one hidden layer to directly output the binary codes. This design has overcome a challenging problem in some previous works optimizing non-smooth objective functions because of binarization. In addition we propose to incorporate independence and balance properties in the direct and strict forms into the learning schemes. We also include a similarity preserving property in our objective functions. The resulting optimizations involving these binary independence and balance constraints are difficult to solve. To tackle this difficulty we propose to learn the networks with alternating optimization and careful relaxation. Furthermore by leveraging the powerful capacity of convolutional neural networks we propose an end-to-end architecture that jointly learns to extract visual features and produce binary hash codes. Experimental results for the benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods compare favorably or outperform the state of the art.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel framework where feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly.

	<td><p>Fabric image retrieval is beneficial to many applications including clothing searching online shopping and cloth modeling. Learning pairwise image similarity is of great importance to an image retrieval task. With the resurgence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) recent works have achieved significant progresses via deep representation learning with metric embedding which drives similar examples close to each other in a feature space and dissimilar ones apart from each other. In this paper we propose a novel embedding method termed focus ranking that can be easily unified into a CNN for jointly learning image representations and metrics in the context of fine-grained fabric image retrieval. Focus ranking aims to rank similar examples higher than all dissimilar ones by penalizing ranking disorders via the minimization of the overall cost attributed to similar samples being ranked below dissimilar ones. At the training stage training samples are organized into focus ranking units for efficient optimization. We build a large-scale fabric image retrieval dataset (FIRD) with about 25000 images of 4300 fabrics and test the proposed model on the FIRD dataset. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model over existing metric embedding models.</p>

Compared with pixel-perfect depictions of photos sketches are iconic renderings of the real world with highly abstract. Therefore matching sketch and photo directly using low-level visual clues are unsufficient since a common low-level subspace that traverses semantically across the two modalities is non-trivial to establish. Most existing SBIR studies do not directly tackle this cross-modal problem. This naturally motivates us to explore the effectiveness of cross-modal retrieval methods in SBIR which have been applied in the image-text matching successfully. In this paper we introduce and compare a series of state-of-the-art cross-modal subspace learning methods and benchmark them on two recently released fine-grained SBIR datasets. Through thorough examination of the experimental results we have demonstrated that the subspace learning can effectively model the sketch-photo domain-gap. In addition we draw a few key insights to drive future research.</p>

	<td><p>Learning-based binary hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast search and retrieval in massive databases. However due to the requirement of discrete outputs for the hash functions learning such functions is known to be very challenging. In addition the objective functions adopted by existing hashing techniques are mostly chosen heuristically. In this paper we propose a novel generative approach to learn hash functions through Minimum Description Length principle such that the learned hash codes maximally compress the dataset and can also be used to regenerate the inputs. We also develop an efficient learning algorithm based on the stochastic distributional gradient which avoids the notorious difficulty caused by binary output constraints to jointly optimize the parameters of the hash function and the associated generative model. Extensive experiments on a variety of large-scale datasets show that the proposed method achieves better retrieval results than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is a basic tool for dimensionality reduction employed in several aspects of machine learning. However the perfomance analysis is often carried out under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function is used without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured input. In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing namely similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et al. NIPS12 and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. ICML09 both of which have found numerous applications i.e. in approximate near-neighbour search with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM. We consider mixed tabulation hashing of Dahlgaard et al.FOCS15 which was proved to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications including OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar for sparse input. Our main contribution however is an experimental comparison of different hashing schemes when used inside FH OPH and LSH. We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work well on sufficiently random data but we demonstrate that in the above applications it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and synthetic data. We also compare with the popular MurmurHash3 which has no proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to truly random hashing in our experiments. However mixed tabulation is 40 faster than MurmurHash3 and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on all possible input.</p>

In this way certain strings can be deduced to be at least within the distance k from each other (using Hamming or Levenshtein distance) without performing an explicit verification. We show experimentally that for a preprocessed collection of strings fingerprints can provide substantial speedups for k = 1 namely over 2.5 times for the Hamming distance and over 10 times for the Levenshtein distance.

	<td><p>Set similarity join is a fundamental and well-studied database operator. It is usually studied in the exact setting where the goal is to compute all pairs of sets that exceed a given similarity threshold (measured e.g. as Jaccard similarity). But set similarity join is often used in settings where 100 recall may not be important â indeed where the exact set similarity join is itself only an approximation of the desired result set. We present a new randomized algorithm for set similarity join that can achieve any desired recall up to 100 and show theoretically and empirically that it significantly improves on existing methods. The present state-of-the-art exact methods are based on prefix-filtering the performance of which depends on the data set having many rare tokens. Our method is robust against the absence of such structure in the data. At 90 recall our algorithm is often more than an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art exact methods depending on how well a data set lends itself to prefix filtering. Our experiments on benchmark data sets also show that the method is several times faster than comparable approximate methods. Our algorithm makes use of recent theoretical advances in high-dimensional sketching and indexing that we believe to be of wider relevance to the data engineering community.</p>

However training a deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data which is an expensive process in terms of time labor and human expertise. Domain adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging labeled data in a different but related source domain to develop a model for the target domain. Further the explosive growth of digital data has posed a fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency recent years have witnessed a wide application of hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper we first introduce a new dataset Office-Home to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms. The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge this is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain adaptation.</p>

This is very useful for digital forensic investigators who are regularly faced with the problem of searching through a seized device for pertinent data. A common scenario is where an investigator is in possession of a collection of known-illegal files (e.g. a collection of child abuse material) and wishes to find whether copies of these are stored on the seized device. Approximate matching addresses shortcomings in traditional hashing which can only find identical files by also being able to deal with cases of merged files embedded files partial files or if a file has been changed in any way. Most approximate matching algorithms work by comparing pairs of files which is not a scalable approach when faced with large corpora. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using a Hierarchical Bloom Filter Tree (HBFT) data structure to reduce the running time of collection-against-collection matching with a specific focus on the MRSH-v2 algorithm. Three experiments are discussed which explore the effects of different configurations of HBFTs. The proposed approach dramatically reduces the number of pairwise comparisons required and demonstrates substantial speed gains while maintaining effectiveness.</p>

We integrate spatial information for discriminative visual representation by partitioning the pedestrian image into horizontal parts. Specifically Part-based Deep Hashing (PDH) is proposed in which batches of triplet samples are employed as the input of the deep hashing architecture. Each triplet sample contains two pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity and one pedestrian image (or part) of the different identity. A triplet loss function is employed with a constraint that the Hamming distance of pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity is smaller than ones with the different identity. In the experiment we show that the proposed Part-based Deep Hashing method yields very competitive re-id accuracy on the large-scale Market-1501 and Market-1501+500K datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Recently hashing methods have been widely used in large-scale image retrieval. However most existing hashing methods did not consider the hierarchical relation of labels which means that they ignored the rich information stored in the hierarchy. Moreover most of previous works treat each bit in a hash code equally which does not meet the scenario of hierarchical labeled data. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method called supervised hierarchical deep hashing (SHDH) to perform hash code learning for hierarchical labeled data. Specifically we define a novel similarity formula for hierarchical labeled data by weighting each layer and design a deep convolutional neural network to obtain a hash code for each data point. Extensive experiments on several real-world public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.</p>

	<td><p>Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani (STOC <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the c-approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level an LSH family hashes nearby points to the same bucket and far away points to different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent which helps determine both query time and space usage. In a seminal work Andoni and Indyk (FOCS </code>06) constructed an LSH family based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of 1/c^2 for the l_2 norm which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani Naor and Panigrahy (SIDMA <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">07) and ODonnell Wu and Zhou (TOCT </code>14). Although optimal in the LSH exponent the ball partitioning approach is computationally expensive. So in the same work Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However no theoretical analysis of the scheme was given thus leaving open the question of finding the exponent of lattice based LSH. In this work we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry of numbers. At a more conceptual level our results show that optimal LSH space partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which additional structure can be imposed on these partitions e.g. to yield low space and query complexity remains an important open problem.</p>

	<td><p>As the amount of textual data has been rapidly increasing over the past decade efficient similarity search methods have become a crucial component of large-scale information retrieval systems. A popular strategy is to represent original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of machine learning methods have been utilized but they often lack expressiveness and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex data. Especially deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural networks which is very suitable for text modeling. However little work has leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing. In this paper we propose a series of novel deep document generative models for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides a principled framework for model extension uncertainty estimation simulation and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.</p>

One of the areas in which GPUs have recently led to a significant speed-up is model checking. In model checking state spaces i.e. large directed graphs are explored to verify whether models satisfy desirable properties. GPUexplore is a GPU-based model checker that uses a hash table to efficiently keep track of already explored states. As a large number of states is discovered and stored during such an exploration the hash table should be able to quickly handle many inserts and queries concurrently. In this paper we experimentally compare two different hash tables optimised for the GPU one being the GPUexplore hash table and the other using Cuckoo hashing. We compare the performance of both hash tables using random and non-random data obtained from model checking experiments to analyse the applicability of the two hash tables for state space exploration. We conclude that Cuckoo hashing is three times faster than GPUexplore hashing for random data and that Cuckoo hashing is five to nine times faster for non-random data. This suggests great potential to further speed up GPUexplore in the near future.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is widely applied to large-scale image retrieval due to the storage and retrieval efficiency. Existing work on deep hashing assumes that the database in the target domain is identically distributed with the training set in the source domain. This paper relaxes this assumption to a transfer retrieval setting which allows the database and the training set to come from different but relevant domains. However the transfer retrieval setting will introduce two technical difficulties first the hash model trained on the source domain cannot work well on the target domain due to the large distribution gap; second the domain gap makes it difficult to concentrate the database points to be within a small Hamming ball. As a consequence transfer retrieval performance within Hamming Radius 2 degrades significantly in existing hashing methods. This paper presents Transfer Adversarial Hashing (TAH) a new hybrid deep architecture that incorporates a pairwise t-distribution cross-entropy loss to learn concentrated hash codes and an adversarial network to align the data distributions between the source and target domains. TAH can generate compact transfer hash codes for efficient image retrieval on both source and target domains. Comprehensive experiments validate that TAH yields state of the art Hamming space retrieval performance on standard datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimodal retrieval with storage and computation efficiency. Cross-modal hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting semantic correlations across different modalities. Existing cross-modal hashing methods first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors, and then generate binary codes by another separate quantization step. However, suboptimal hash codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes.
This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal hashing, which jointly learns good data representation tailored to hash coding and formally controls the quantization error. The proposed CHN is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good image representations, a multilayer perception for learning good text representations, two hashing layers for generating compact binary codes, and a structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical study shows that CHN yields state of the art cross-modal retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

Deep learning to hash which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and hash encoding has received increasing attention recently.

This work presents HashNet a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training until it eventually goes back to being the original difficult to optimize deep network with the sign activation function.

All the existing deep hashing papers report their methods superior performance over the traditional hashing methods according to their experimental results. However there are serious flaws in the evaluations of existing deep hashing papers (1) The datasets they used are too small and simple to simulate the real CBIR situation. (2) They did not correctly include the search time in their evaluation criteria while the search time is crucial in real CBIR systems. (3) The performance of some unsupervised hashing algorithms (e.g. LSH) can easily be boosted if one uses multiple hash tables which is an important factor should be considered in the evaluation while most of the deep hashing papers failed to do so. We re-evaluate several state-of-the-art deep hashing methods with a carefully designed experimental setting. Empirical results reveal that the performance of these deep hashing methods are inferior to multi-table IsoH a very simple unsupervised hashing method.

Unlike most of the short-code based retrieval systems the proposed method provides the query localization in the retrieved image. The efficiency of the search is boosted by approximating a 2D translation search via trigonometric polynomial of scores by 1D projections. The projections are a special case of AFM.

We propose a method to perform large-scale image forensics on the order of one million images using the help of an image search algorithm and database to gather contextual clues as to where tampering may have taken place. In this vein we introduce five new strongly invariant image comparison methods and test their effectiveness under heavy noise rotation and color space changes.

To achieve this the neighborhood of the query image is divided into coherent clusters from which the user may choose the relevant ones. A novel feedback integration technique is then employed to re-rank the entire database with regard to both the user feedback and the original query.

	<td><p>Retrieving nearest neighbors across correlated data in multiple modalities such as image-text pairs on Facebook and video-tag pairs on YouTube has become a challenging task due to the huge amount of data. Multimodal hashing methods that embed data into binary codes can boost the retrieving speed and reduce storage requirement. As unsupervised multimodal hashing methods are usually inferior to supervised ones while the supervised ones requires too much manually labeled data the proposed method in this paper utilizes a part of labels to design a semi-supervised multimodal hashing method. It first computes the transformation matrices for data matrices and label matrix. Then with these transformation matrices fuzzy logic is introduced to estimate a label matrix for unlabeled data. Finally it uses the estimated label matrix to learn hashing functions for data in each modality to generate a unified binary code matrix. Experiments show that the proposed semi-supervised method with 50 labels can get a medium performance among the compared supervised ones and achieve an approximate performance to the best supervised method with 90 labels. With only 10 labels the proposed method can still compete with the worst compared supervised one.</p>

Our method (Single Projection Radon Barcode or SP-RBC) uses only a few Radon single projections for each image as global features that can serve as a basis for weak learners. This is our most important contribution in this work which improves the results of the RBC considerably. As a matter of fact only one projection of an image as short as a single SURF feature vector can already achieve acceptable results. Nevertheless using multiple projections in a long vector will not deliver anticipated improvements. To exploit the information inherent in each projection our method uses the outcome of each projection separately and then applies more precise local search on the small subset of retrieved images. We have tested our method using IRMA 2009 dataset a with 14400 x-ray images as part of imageCLEF initiative. Our approach leads to a substantial decrease in the error rate in comparison with other non-learning methods.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing is usually regarded as an effective technique for large-scale textual-visual cross retrieval where data from different modalities are mapped into a shared Hamming space for matching. Most of the traditional textual-visual binary encoding methods only consider holistic image representations and fail to model descriptive sentences. This renders existing methods inappropriate to handle the rich semantics of informative cross-modal data for quality textual-visual search tasks. To address the problem of hashing cross-modal data with semantic-rich cues in this paper a novel integrated deep architecture is developed to effectively encode the detailed semantics of informative images and long descriptive sentences named as Textual-Visual Deep Binaries (TVDB). In particular region-based convolutional networks with long short-term memory units are introduced to fully explore image regional details while semantic cues of sentences are modeled by a text convolutional network. Additionally we propose a stochastic batch-wise training routine where high-quality binary codes and deep encoding functions are efficiently optimized in an alternating manner. Experiments are conducted on three multimedia datasets i.e. Microsoft COCO IAPR TC-12 and INRIA Web Queries where the proposed TVDB model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binary coding methods in the task of cross-modal retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is an important tool for managing high-dimensional noisy or uncertain data for example in connection with data cleaning (similarity join) and noise-robust search (similarity search). However for a number of problems the LSH framework is not known to yield good solutions and instead ad hoc solutions have been designed for particular similarity and distance measures. For example this is true for output-sensitive similarity search/join and for indexes supporting annulus queries that aim to report a point close to a certain given distance from the query point. In this paper we initiate the study of distance-sensitive hashing (DSH) a generalization of LSH that seeks a family of hash functions such that the probability of two points having the same hash value is a given function of the distance between them. More precisely given a distance space (X ) and a collision probability function (CPF) fcolon rightarrow 01 we seek a distribution over pairs of functions (hg) such that for every pair of points x y in X the collision probability is Prh(x)=g(y) = f((xy)). Locality-sensitive hashing is the study of how fast a CPF can decrease as the distance grows. For many spaces f can be made exponentially decreasing even if we restrict attention to the symmetric case where g=h. We show that the asymmetry achieved by having a pair of functions makes it possible to achieve CPFs that are for example increasing or unimodal and show how this leads to principled solutions to problems not addressed by the LSH framework. This includes a novel application to privacy-preserving distance estimation. We believe that the DSH framework will find further applications in high-dimensional data management.</p>

Therefore we introduce a new large dataset suitable for training and testing modern descriptors together with strictly defined evaluation protocols in several tasks such as matching retrieval and classification. This allows for more realistic and thus more reliable comparisons in different application scenarios. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art descriptors and analyse their properties. We show that a simple normalisation of traditional hand-crafted descriptors can boost their performance to the level of deep learning based descriptors within a realistic benchmarks evaluation.</p>

	<td><p>Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) has achieved significant progress recently. However the number of fine-grained species could be huge and dynamically increasing in real scenarios making it difficult to recognize unseen objects under the current FGVC framework. This raises an open issue to perform large-scale fine-grained identification without a complete training set. Aiming to conquer this issue we propose a retrieval task named One-Shot Fine-Grained Instance Retrieval (OSFGIR). One-Shot denotes the ability of identifying unseen objects through a fine-grained retrieval task assisted with an incomplete auxiliary training set. This paper first presents the detailed description to OSFGIR task and our collected OSFGIR-378K dataset. Next we propose the Convolutional and Normalization Networks (CN-Nets) learned on the auxiliary dataset to generate a concise and discriminative representation. Finally we present a coarse-to-fine retrieval framework consisting of three components i.e. coarse retrieval fine-grained retrieval and query expansion respectively. The framework progressively retrieves images with similar semantics and performs fine-grained identification. Experiments show our OSFGIR framework achieves significantly better accuracy and efficiency than existing FGVC and image retrieval methods thus could be a better solution for large-scale fine-grained object identification.</p>

	<td><p>The local descriptors have been the backbone of most of the computer vision problems. Most of the existing local descriptors are generated over the raw input images. In order to increase the discriminative power of the local descriptors some researchers converted the raw image into multiple images with the help of some high and low pass frequency filters then the local descriptors are computed over each filtered image and finally concatenated into a single descriptor. By doing so these approaches do not utilize the inter frequency relationship which causes the less improvement in the discriminative power of the descriptor that could be achieved. In this paper this problem is solved by utilizing the decoder concept of multi-channel decoded local binary pattern over the multi-frequency patterns. A frequency decoded local binary pattern (FDLBP) is proposed with two decoders. Each decoder works with one low frequency pattern and two high frequency patterns. Finally the descriptors from both decoders are concatenated to form the single descriptor. The face retrieval experiments are conducted over four benchmarks and challenging databases such as PaSC LFW PubFig and ESSEX. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the FDLBP descriptor as compared to the state-of-the-art descriptors such as LBP SOBEL_LBP BoF_LBP SVD_S_LBP mdLBP etc.</p>

To accommodate effective categorization and easy search users are allowed to make use of hashtags keywords or phrases prefixed by hash character to categorize and summarize their posts. However valid hashtags are not restricted and thus are created in a free and heterogeneous style increasing difficulty of the task of tweet categorization. In this paper we propose a low-rank weighted matrix factorization based method to recommend hashtags to the users solely based on their hashtag usage history and independent from their tweets contents. We confirm using two-sample t-test that users are more likely to adopt new hashtags similar to the ones they have previously adopted. In particular we formulate the problem of hashtag recommendation into an optimization problem and incorporate hashtag correlation weight matrix into it to account for the similarity between different hashtags. We finally leverage widely used matrix factorization from recommender systems to solve the optimization problem by capturing the latent factors of users and hashtags. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method is capable to properly recommend hashtags.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper a new texture descriptor based on the local neighborhood intensity difference is proposed for content based image retrieval (CBIR). For computation of texture features like Local Binary Pattern (LBP) the center pixel in a 33 window of an image is compared with all the remaining neighbors one pixel at a time to generate a binary bit pattern. It ignores the effect of the adjacent neighbors of a particular pixel for its binary encoding and also for texture description. The proposed method is based on the concept that neighbors of a particular pixel hold a significant amount of texture information that can be considered for efficient texture representation for CBIR. Taking this into account we develop a new texture descriptor named as Local Neighborhood Intensity Pattern (LNIP) which considers the relative intensity difference between a particular pixel and the center pixel by considering its adjacent neighbors and generate a sign and a magnitude pattern. Since sign and magnitude patterns hold complementary information to each other these two patterns are concatenated into a single feature descriptor to generate a more concrete and useful feature descriptor. The proposed descriptor has been tested for image retrieval on four databases including three texture image databases - Brodatz texture image database MIT VisTex database and Salzburg texture database and one face database ATT face database. The precision and recall values observed on these databases are compared with some state-of-art local patterns. The proposed method showed a significant improvement over many other existing methods.</p>

In CBIR the images are represented in the feature space and the performance of CBIR depends on the type of selected feature representation. Late fusion also known as visual words integration is applied to enhance the performance of image retrieval. The recent advances in image retrieval diverted the focus of research towards the use of binary descriptors as they are reported computationally efficient. In this paper we aim to investigate the late fusion of Fast Retina Keypoint (FREAK) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). The late fusion of binary and local descriptor is selected because among binary descriptors FREAK has shown good results in classification-based problems while SIFT is robust to translation scaling rotation and small distortions. The late fusion of FREAK and SIFT integrates the performance of both feature descriptors for an effective image retrieval. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed late fusion enhances the performances of image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Many multimedia information retrieval or machine learning problems require efficient high-dimensional nearest neighbor search techniques. For instance multimedia objects (images music or videos) can be represented by high-dimensional feature vectors. Finding two similar multimedia objects then comes down to finding two objects that have similar feature vectors. In the current context of mass use of social networks large scale multimedia databases or large scale machine learning applications are more and more common calling for efficient nearest neighbor search approaches. This thesis builds on product quantization an efficient nearest neighbor search technique that compresses high-dimensional vectors into short codes. This makes it possible to store very large databases entirely in RAM enabling low response times. We propose several contributions that exploit the capabilities of modern CPUs especially SIMD and the cache hierarchy to further decrease response times offered by product quantization.</p>

	<td><p>As the rapid growth of multi-modal data hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval have received considerable attention. Deep-networks-based cross-modal hashing methods are appealing as they can integrate feature learning and hash coding into end-to-end trainable frameworks. However it is still challenging to find content similarities between different modalities of data due to the heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem we propose an adversarial hashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi-modal data. The proposed new adversarial network HashGAN consists of three building blocks 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations 2) the generative attention module to generate an attention mask which is used to obtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature representations 3) the discriminative hash coding module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in an adversarial way the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the background feature representations while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. both the foreground and the background feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Mobile landmark search (MLS) recently receives increasing attention for its great practical values. However it still remains unsolved due to two important challenges. One is high bandwidth consumption of query transmission and the other is the huge visual variations of query images sent from mobile devices. In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme named as canonical view based discrete multi-modal hashing (CV-DMH) to handle these problems via a novel three-stage learning procedure. First a submodular function is designed to measure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it canonical views which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited redundancy are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy. Second multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from multiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and adaptively characterize visual contents of varied landmark images with certain canonical views. Finally compact binary codes are learned on intermediate representation within a tailored discrete binary embedding model which preserves visual relations of images measured with canonical views and removes the involved noises. In this part we develop a new augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) based optimization method to directly solve the discrete binary codes. We can not only explicitly deal with the discrete constraint but also consider the bit-uncorrelated constraint and balance constraint together. Experiments on real world landmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CV-DMH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Techniques to learn hash codes which can store and retrieve large dimensional multimedia data efficiently have attracted broad research interests in the recent years. With rapid explosion of newly emerged concepts and online data existing supervised hashing algorithms suffer from the problem of scarcity of ground truth annotations due to the high cost of obtaining manual annotations. Therefore we propose an algorithm to learn a hash function from training images belonging to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen classes which can efficiently encode images of </code>unseen classes to binary codes. Specifically we project the image features from visual space and semantic features from semantic space into a common Hamming subspace. Earlier works to generate hash codes have tried to relax the discrete constraints on hash codes and solve the continuous optimization problem. However it often leads to quantization errors. In this work we use the max-margin classifier to learn an efficient hash function. To address the concern of domain-shift which may arise due to the introduction of new classes we also introduce an unsupervised domain adaptation model in the proposed hashing framework. Results on the three datasets show the advantage of using domain adaptation in learning a high-quality hash function and superiority of our method for the task of image retrieval performance as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

In this work we propose a novel salient region detection method. It captures in an unsupervised manner patterns that are both discriminative and common in the dataset. Saliency is based on a centrality measure of a nearest neighbor graph constructed from regional CNN representations of dataset images. The descriptors derived from the salient regions improve particular object retrieval most noticeably in a large collections containing small objects.</p>

Our experiments show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results comparable to neural embedding learning techniques however with only a fraction of the computational complexity of these methods. While the proposed derandomization enhances the computational and space complexity of our method the possibility of applying weighting methods such as positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) to our models after their construction (and at a reduced dimensionality) imparts a high discriminatory power to the resulting embeddings.

Consequently the problem is of theoretical as well as practical interest. When the constraints are expressed as DNF formulas Monte Carlo-based techniques have been shown to provide a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). For CNF constraints hashing-based approximation techniques have been demonstrated to be highly successful. Furthermore it was shown that hashing-based techniques also yield an FPRAS for DNF counting without usage of Monte Carlo sampling. Our analysis however shows that the proposed hashing-based approach to DNF counting provides poor time complexity compared to the Monte Carlo-based DNF counting techniques. Given the success of hashing-based techniques for CNF constraints it is natural to ask Can hashing-based techniques provide an efficient FPRAS for DNF counting In this paper we provide a positive answer to this question. To this end we introduce two novel algorithmic techniques and along with a new hash family of . These innovations allow us to design a hashing-based FPRAS for DNF counting of similar complexity (up to polylog factors) as that of prior works. Furthermore we expect these techniques to have potential applications beyond DNF counting.</p>

It uses the composition of several (M) elements each of which is selected from a different dictionary to accurately approximate a D-dimensional vector thus yielding accurate search and represents the data vector by a short code composed of the indices of the selected elements in the corresponding dictionaries. Our key contribution lies in introducing a near-orthogonality constraint which makes the search efficiency is guaranteed as the cost of the distance computation is reduced to O(M) from O(D) through a distance table lookup scheme. The resulting approach is called near-orthogonal composite quantization. We theoretically justify the equivalence between near-orthogonal composite quantization and minimizing an upper bound of a function formed by jointly considering the quantization error and the search cost according to a generalized triangle inequality. We empirically show the efficacy of the proposed approach over several benchmark datasets. In addition we demonstrate the superior performances in other three applications combination with inverted multi-index quantizing the query for mobile search and inner-product similarity search.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we propose a ranking based locality sensitive hashing inspired two-factor cancelable biometrics dubbed Index-of-Max (IoM) hashing for biometric template protection. With externally generated random parameters IoM hashing transforms a real-valued biometric feature vector into discrete index (max ranked) hashed code. We demonstrate two realizations from IoM hashing notion namely Gaussian Random Projection based and Uniformly Random Permutation based hashing schemes. The discrete indices representation nature of IoM hashed codes enjoy serveral merits. Firstly IoM hashing empowers strong concealment to the biometric information. This contributes to the solid ground of non-invertibility guarantee. Secondly IoM hashing is insensitive to the features magnitude hence is more robust against biometric features variation. Thirdly the magnitude-independence trait of IoM hashing makes the hash codes being scale-invariant which is critical for matching and feature alignment. The experimental results demonstrate favorable accuracy performance on benchmark FVC2002 and FVC2004 fingerprint databases. The analyses justify its resilience to the existing and newly introduced security and privacy attacks as well as satisfy the revocability and unlinkability criteria of cancelable biometrics.</p>

In many fields huge amounts of data are currently generated however extracting meaningful information from voluminous data sets such as computing similarity between elements is far from being trivial.

Our structure out-compete the hash table for construction query times and for memory usage in the case of the indexation of a static set. To illustrate the impact of algorithms performances we provide two applications based on similarity computation between collections of sequences and for which this calculation is an expensive but required operation.

In this paper a scalable solution based on hill-climbing strategy with the support of k-nearest neighbor graph (kNN) is presented. Two major issues have been considered in the paper. Firstly an efficient kNN graph construction method based on two means tree is presented. For the nearest neighbor search an enhanced hill-climbing procedure is proposed which sees considerable performance boost over original procedure. Furthermore with the support of inverted indexing derived from residue vector quantization our method achieves close to 100 recall with high speed efficiency in two state-of-the-art evaluation benchmarks. In addition a comparative study on both the compressional and traditional nearest neighbor search methods is presented. We show that our method achieves the best trade-off between search quality efficiency and memory complexity.</p>

By using supervised information supervised hashing can significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently discrete supervised hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in supervised hashing. On one hand hashing is essentially a discrete optimization problem. Hence utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete (binary) coding procedure can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the accuracy. On the other hand deep hashing which integrates deep feature learning and hash-code learning into an end-to-end architecture can enhance the feedback between feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in discrete supervised hashing is to adopt supervised information to directly guide the discrete coding procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to adopt the supervised information to directly guide the deep feature learning procedure. However there have not existed works which can use the supervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure in the same framework. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH) to address this problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize supervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure and thus enhance the feedback between these two important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines including both discrete hashing and deep hashing baselines for image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search because of its storage and search efficiency. Recent work has found that deep supervised hashing can significantly outperform non-deep supervised hashing in many applications. However most existing deep supervised hashing methods adopt a symmetric strategy to learn one deep hash function for both query points and database (retrieval) points. The training of these symmetric deep supervised hashing methods is typically time-consuming which makes them hard to effectively utilize the supervised information for cases with large-scale database. In this paper we propose a novel deep supervised hashing method called asymmetric deep supervised hashing (ADSH) for large-scale nearest neighbor search. ADSH treats the query points and database points in an asymmetric way. More specifically ADSH learns a deep hash function only for query points while the hash codes for database points are directly learned. The training of ADSH is much more efficient than that of traditional symmetric deep supervised hashing methods. Experiments show that ADSH can achieve state-of-the-art performance in real applications.</p>

In this paper we consider the fundamental problem of finding a nearest set from a collection of sets to a query set. This problem has obvious applications in large-scale visual retrieval and recognition and also in applied fields beyond computer vision. One challenge stands out in solving the problemâset representation and measure of similarity. Particularly the query set and the sets in dataset collection can have varying cardinalities. The training collection is large enough such that linear scan is impractical. We propose a simple representation scheme that encodes both statistical and structural information of the sets. The derived representations are integrated in a kernel framework for flexible similarity measurement. For the query set process we adopt a learning-to-hash pipeline that turns the kernel representations into hash bits based on simple learners using multiple kernel learning. Experiments on two visual retrieval datasets show unambiguously that our set-to-set hashing framework outperforms prior methods that do not take the set-to-set search setting.</p>

An identifier of each database vector is associated with the slot of a hash table by using its PQ-code as a key. For querying an input vector is PQ-encoded and hashed and the items associated with that code are then retrieved. The proposed PQTable produces the same results as a linear PQ scan and is 10^2 to 10^5 times faster. Although state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by previous inverted-indexing-based approaches such methods require manually-designed parameter setting and significant training; our PQTable is free of these limitations and therefore offers a practical and effective solution for real-world problems. Specifically when the vectors are highly compressed our PQTable achieves one of the fastest search performances on a single CPU to date with significantly efficient memory usage (0.059 ms per query over 10^9 data points with just 5.5 GB memory consumption). Finally we show that our proposed PQTable can naturally handle the codes of an optimized product quantization (OPQTable).</p>

By appending an ingeniously designed DBE layer to the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) DBE learns binary code directly from the continuous DBE layer activation without quantization error. By employing the deep residual network (ResNet) as DCNN component DBE captures rich semantics from images. Furthermore in the effort of handling multilabel images we design a joint cross entropy loss that includes both softmax cross entropy and weighted binary cross entropy in consideration of the correlation and independence of labels respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of DBE over state-of-the-art methods on tasks of natural object recognition image retrieval and image annotation.</p>

However random sampling selection criteria often leads to redundant and noisy-image patches for model training. With minimal research efforts behind this challenge the current status spells missed opportunities to develop supervised learning algorithms that generalize over wide geographical scenes. In addition much of the computational cycles for large scale machine learning are poorly spent crunching through noisy and redundant image patches. We demonstrate a potential framework to address these challenges specifically while evaluating a human settlement detection task. A novel binary search tree sampling scheme is fused with a kernel based hashing procedure that maps image patches into hash-buckets using binary codes generated from image content. The framework exploits inherent redundancy within billions of image patches to promote mostly high variance preserving samples for accelerating algorithmic training and increasing model generalization.</p>

The method uses keypoints from standard keypoint detectors. The descriptor is built by constructing a Local Reference Frame and aligning a local surface patch accordingly. The local surface patch constitutes of identifying nearest neighbours based upon an angular constraint among them. The points are ordered with respect to the distance from the keypoints. The normals of the ordered pairs of these keypoints are projected on the axes and the relative magnitude is used to assign a binary digit.

However the most striking successes in deep hashing have mostly involved discriminative models which require labels. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing method named Deep Discrete Hashing (DDH) for large-scale image retrieval and classification. In the proposed framework we address two main problems 1) how to directly learn discrete binary codes 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval and classification in an unsupervised way We resolve these problems by introducing an intermediate variable and a loss function steering the learning process which is based on the neighborhood structure in the original space. Experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and Oxford-17) demonstrate that our DDH significantly outperforms existing hashing methods by large margin in terms of~mAP for image retrieval and object recognition.

	<td><p>Given a pedestrian image as a query the purpose of person re-identification is to identify the correct match from a large collection of gallery images depicting the same person captured by disjoint camera views. The critical challenge is how to construct a robust yet discriminative feature representation to capture the compounded variations in pedestrian appearance. To this end deep learning methods have been proposed to extract hierarchical features against extreme variability of appearance. However existing methods in this category generally neglect the efficiency in the matching stage whereas the searching speed of a re-identification system is crucial in real-world applications. In this paper we present a novel deep hashing framework with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fast person re-identification. Technically we simultaneously learn both CNN features and hash functions/codes to get robust yet discriminative features and similarity-preserving hash codes. Thereby person re-identification can be resolved by efficiently computing and ranking the Hamming distances between images. A structured loss function defined over positive pairs and hard negatives is proposed to formulate a novel optimization problem so that fast convergence and more stable optimized solution can be obtained. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks CUHK03 and Market-1501 show that the proposed deep architecture is efficacy over state-of-the-arts.</p>

To this end we propose a simple yet efficient deep-network-based multi-index hashing method for simultaneously learning the powerful image representation and the efficient searching. To achieve these two goals we introduce the multi-index hashing (MIH) mechanism into the proposed deep architecture which divides the binary codes into multiple substrings. Due to the non-uniformly distributed codes will result in inefficiency searching we add the two balanced constraints at feature-level and instance-level respectively. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image retrieval datasets show that the learned balanced binary codes bring dramatic speedups and achieve comparable performance over the existing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Zero-shot Hashing (ZSH) is to learn hashing models for novel/target classes without training data which is an important and challenging problem. Most existing ZSH approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate shared semantic representations between the seen/source classes and novel/target classes. However due to having disjoint the hash functions learned from the source dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. In this paper we study the transductive ZSH i.e. we have unlabeled data for novel classes. We put forward a simple yet efficient joint learning approach via coarse-to-fine similarity mining which transfers knowledges from source data to target data. It mainly consists of two building blocks in the proposed deep architecture 1) a shared two-streams network which the first stream operates on the source data and the second stream operates on the unlabeled data to learn the effective common image representations and 2) a coarse-to-fine module which begins with finding the most representative images from target classes and then further detect similarities among these images to transfer the similarities of the source data to the target data in a greedy fashion. Extensive evaluation results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recent technological advancements have led to the generation of huge amounts of data over the web such as text image audio and video. Most of this data is high dimensional and sparse for e.g. the bag-of-words representation used for representing text. Often an efficient search for similar data points needs to be performed in many applications like clustering nearest neighbour search ranking and indexing. Even though there have been significant increases in computational power a simple brute-force similarity-search on such datasets is inefficient and at times impossible. Thus it is desirable to get a compressed representation which preserves the similarity between data points. In this work we consider the data points as sets and use Jaccard similarity as the similarity measure. Compression techniques are generally evaluated on the following parameters â1) Randomness required for compression 2) Time required for compression 3) Dimension of the data after compression and 4) Space required to store the compressed data. Ideally the compressed representation of the data should be such that the similarity between each pair of data points is preserved while keeping the time and the randomness required for compression as low as possible. We show that the compression technique suggested by Pratap and Kulkarni also works well for Jaccard similarity. We present a theoretical proof of the same and complement it with rigorous experimentations on synthetic as well as real-world datasets. We also compare our results with the state-of-the-art min-wise independent permutation and show that our compression algorithm achieves almost equal accuracy while significantly reducing the compression time and the randomness.</p>

The first one is Nested Invariance Pooling (NIP) a method inspired from i-theory a mathematical theory for computing group invariant transformations with feed-forward neural networks. NIP is able to produce compact and well-performing descriptors with visual representations extracted from convolutional neural networks. We specifically incorporate scale translation and rotation invariances but the scheme can be extended to any arbitrary sets of transformations. We also show that using moments of increasing order throughout nesting is important. The NIP descriptors are then hashed to the target code size (32-256 bits) with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine with a novel batch-level regularization scheme specifically designed for the purpose of hashing (RBMH). A thorough empirical evaluation with state-of-the-art shows that the results obtained both with the NIP descriptors and the NIP+RBMH hashes are consistently outstanding across a wide range of datasets.</p>

Most of the indexed vectors are filtered out with Hamming distance letting only a fraction of the vectors to be ranked with an asymmetric distance estimator. The method is complementary with a coarse partitioning of the feature space such as the inverted multi-index. This is shown by our experiments performed on several public benchmarks such as the BIGANN dataset comprising one billion vectors for which we report state-of-the-art results for query times below 0.3millisecond per core.

Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps: bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes, followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space, allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds, or vice-versa. In our experiments over two standard image datasets we find statistically significant increases in retrieval effectiveness versus a host of state-of-the-art data-dependent and independent hashing models.</p>

Storage efficiency is achieved by converting the fixed-length hash code into a variable-length code. Search efficiency is obtained by using a multiple hash table structure. With VLH we are able to deliberately add redundancy into hash codes to improve retrieval performance with little sacrifice in storage efficiency or search complexity.

	<td><p>This paper proposes two approaches for inferencing binary codes in two-step (supervised unsupervised) hashing. We first introduce an unified formulation for both supervised and unsupervised hashing. Then we cast the learning of one bit as a Binary Quadratic Problem (BQP). We propose two approaches to solve BQP. In the first approach we relax BQP as a semidefinite programming problem which its global optimum can be achieved. We theoretically prove that the objective value of the binary solution achieved by this approach is well bounded. In the second approach we propose an augmented Lagrangian based approach to solve BQP directly without relaxing the binary constraint. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed methods compare favorably with the state of the art.</p>

	<td><p>Most image instance retrieval pipelines are based on comparison of vectors known as global image descriptors between a query image and the database images. Due to their success in large scale image classification representations extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are quickly gaining ground on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as state-of-the-art global descriptors for image instance retrieval. While CNN-based descriptors are generally remarked for good retrieval performance at lower bitrates they nevertheless present a number of drawbacks including the lack of robustness to common object transformations such as rotations compared with their interest point based FV counterparts. In this paper we propose a method for computing invariant global descriptors from CNNs. Our method implements a recently proposed mathematical theory for invariance in a sensory cortex modeled as a feedforward neural network. The resulting global descriptors can be made invariant to multiple arbitrary transformation groups while retaining good discriminativeness. Based on a thorough empirical evaluation using several publicly available datasets we show that our method is able to significantly and consistently improve retrieval results every time a new type of invariance is incorporated. We also show that our method which has few parameters is not prone to overfitting improvements generalize well across datasets with different properties with regard to invariances. Finally we show that our descriptors are able to compare favourably to other state-of-the-art compact descriptors in similar bitranges exceeding the highest retrieval results reported in the literature on some datasets. A dedicated dimensionality reduction step âquantization or hashingâ may be able to further improve the competitiveness of the descriptors.</p>

First motivated by the relationship between the linear approximation of a nonlinear function in high dimensional space and the stateof-the-art feature representation used in image retrieval i.e. VLAD we propose a new approach for the approximation. The embedded vectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated to form a single representation for image retrieval. Second in order to make the proposed embedding method applicable to large scale problem we further derive its fast version in which the embedded vectors can be efficiently computed i.e. in the closed-form. We compare the proposed embedding methods with the state of the art in the context of image search under various settings when the images are represented by medium length vectors short vectors or binary vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed embedding methods outperform existing the state of the art on the standard public image retrieval benchmarks.</p>

This paper presents a simple innovative learning-free method for word spotting from large scale historical documents combining Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and spatial sampling. This method offers three advantages firstly it operates in completely learning free paradigm which is very different from unsupervised learning methods secondly the computational time is significantly low because of the LBP features which are very fast to compute and thirdly the method can be used in scenarios where annotations are not available. Finally we compare the results of our proposed retrieval method with the other methods in the literature.</p>

	<td><p>The query-by-image video retrieval (QBIVR) task has been attracting considerable research attention recently. However most existing methods represent a video by either aggregating or projecting all its frames into a single datum point which may easily cause severe information loss. In this paper we propose an efficient QBIVR framework to enable an effective and efficient video search with image query. We first define a similarity-preserving distance metric between an image and its orthogonal projection in the subspace of the video which can be equivalently transformed to a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Besides to boost the efficiency of solving the MIPS problem we propose two asymmetric hashing schemes which bridge the domain gap of images and videos. The first approach termed Inner-product Binary Coding (IBC) preserves the inner relationships of images and videos in a common Hamming space. To further improve the retrieval efficiency we devise a Bilinear Binary Coding (BBC) approach which employs compact bilinear projections instead of a single large projection matrix. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four real-world video datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches as compared to the state-of-the-arts.</p>

However hash codes significantly depend on the dissimilarity which prohibits users from adjusting the dissimilarity at query time. In this paper we propose multiple purpose LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash codes for different dissimilarities. mp-LSH supports L2 cosine and inner product dissimilarities and their corresponding weighted sums where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus mp-LSH enables us for example to retrieve similar items to a query with the user preference taken into account to find a similar material to a query with some properties (stability utility etc.) optimized and to turn on or off a part of multi-modal information (brightness color audio text etc.) in image/video retrieval. We theoretically and empirically analyze the performance of three variants of mp-LSH and demonstrate their usefulness on real-world data sets.</p>

Since hash table accesses can dominate the execution time of the overall application we need implementations that achieve good speedup. Unfortunately currently available concurrent hashing libraries turn out to be far away from this requirement in particular when contention on some elements occurs. Our starting point for better performing data structures is a fast and simple lock-free concurrent hash table based on linear probing that is limited to word-sized key-value types and does not support dynamic size adaptation. We explain how to lift these limitations in a provably scalable way and demonstrate that dynamic growing has a performance overhead comparable to the same generalization in sequential hash tables. We perform extensive experiments comparing the performance of our implementations with six of the most widely used concurrent hash tables. Ours are considerably faster than the best algorithms with similar restrictions and an order of magnitude faster than the best more general tables. In some extreme cases the difference even approaches four orders of magnitude.</p>

Most existing hashing methods first encode the images as a vector of hand-crafted features followed by a separate binarization step to generate hash codes. This two-stage process may produce sub-optimal encoding. In this paper for the first time we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing through residual learning termed Deep Residual Hashing (DRH) for an end-to-end simultaneous representation learning and hash coding. The DRH model constitutes four key elements (1) a sub-network with multiple stacked residual blocks; (2) hashing layer for binarization; (3) supervised retrieval loss function based on neighbourhood component analysis for similarity preserving embedding; and (4) hashing related losses and regularisation to control the quantization error and improve the quality of hash coding. We present results of extensive experiments on a large public chest x-ray image database with co-morbidities and discuss the outcome showing substantial improvements over the latest state-of-the art methods.</p>

Building on the recent theoretical CoveringLSH construction that eliminates false negatives we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for Hamming space called . Inheriting the design benefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports all near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic improvement to the hash function computation time from (dL) to (d + L) where d is the dimensionality of data and L is the number of hash tables. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that is comparable (and often superior) to traditional hashing-based approaches for search radius up to 20 in high-dimensional Hamming space.</p>

The recent CBIR research trend favors the construction and use of binary codes to represent images. Deep architectures could learn the non-linear relationship among image pixels adaptively allowing the automatic learning of high-level features from raw pixels. However most of them require class labels which are expensive to obtain particularly for medical images. The methods which do not need class labels utilize a deep autoencoder for binary hashing but the code construction involves a specific training algorithm and an ad-hoc regularization technique. In this study we explored using a deep de-noising autoencoder (DDA) with a new unsupervised training scheme using only backpropagation and dropout to hash images into binary codes. We conducted experiments on more than 14000 x-ray images. By using class labels only for evaluating the retrieval results we constructed a 16-bit DDA and a 512-bit DDA independently. Comparing to other unsupervised methods we succeeded to obtain the lowest total error by using the 512-bit codes for retrieval via exhaustive search and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the 16-bit codes while keeping a comparable total error. We found that our new training scheme could reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9. To further boost the image retrieval performance we developed Radon Autoencoder Barcode (RABC) which are learned from the Radon projections of images using a de-noising autoencoder. Experimental results demonstrated its superior performance in retrieval when it was combined with DDA binary codes.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing produces compact representations for documents to perform tasks like classification or retrieval based on these short codes. When hashing is supervised the codes are trained using labels on the training data. This paper first shows that the evaluation protocols used in the literature for supervised hashing are not satisfactory we show that a trivial solution that encodes the output of a classifier significantly outperforms existing supervised or semi-supervised methods while using much shorter codes. We then propose two alternative protocols for supervised hashing one based on retrieval on a disjoint set of classes and another based on transfer learning to new classes. We provide two baseline methods for image-related tasks to assess the performance of (semi-)supervised hashing without coding and with unsupervised codes. These baselines give a lower- and upper-bound on the performance of a supervised hashing scheme.</p>

	<td><p>A homomorphic or incremental multiset hash function associates a hash value to arbitrary collections of objects (with possible repetitions) in such a way that the hash of the union of two collections is easy to compute from the hashes of the two collections themselves it is simply their sum under a suitable group operation. In particular hash values of large collections can be computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a very useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity verification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding. Unfortunately constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature are hampered by two main drawbacks they tend to be much longer than usual hash functions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of 2^128 they are several thousand bits long as opposed to 256 bits for usual hash functions) and they are also quite slow. In this paper we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH) which combines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient encoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one hand the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal 2m-bit hash values provide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand we demonstrate a highly-efficient software implementation of ECMH which our thorough empirical evaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per second on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security levelâmany times faster than previous practical methods.</p>

This motivates the design of image analysis solutions that are able to effectively integrate the multi-view information provided by different feature sets. We therefore propose a new image retrieval solution that is able to sort images through a random walk on a multi-layer graph where each layer corresponds to a different type of information about the image data. We study in depth the design of the image graph and propose in particular an effective method to select the edge weights for the multi-layer graph such that the image ranking scores are optimised. We then provide extensive experiments in different real-world photo collections which confirm the high performance of our new image retrieval algorithm that generally surpasses state-of-the-art solutions due to a more meaningful image similarity computation.</p>

To facilitate large-scale cross-media retrieval we propose a novel unsupervised cross-media hashing method. Our method incorporates local affinity and distance repulsion constraints into a matrix factorization framework. Correspondingly the proposed method learns hash functions that generates unified hash codes from different media types while ensuring intrinsic geometric structure of the data distribution is preserved. These hash codes empower the similarity between data of different media types to be evaluated directly.

Departing from the previous methods fusing multiple image descriptors simultaneously C2F is featured by a layered procedure composed by filtering and refining. In particular C2F consists of three components. 1) Distractor filtering. With holistic representations noise images are filtered out from the database so the number of candidate images to be used for comparison with the query can be greatly reduced. 2) Adaptive weighting. For a certain query the similarity of candidate images can be estimated by holistic similarity scores in complementary to the local ones. 3) Candidate refining. Accurate retrieval is conducted via local features combining the pre-computed adaptive weights. Experiments are presented on two benchmarks Holidays and Ukbench datasets. We show that our method outperforms recent fusion methods in terms of storage consumption and computation complexity and that the accuracy is competitive to the state-of-the-arts.</p>

Our proposal is a compact image descriptor that combines the state-of-the-art in content-based descriptor extraction with a multi-level Voronoi-based spatial partitioning of each dataset image. The proposed multi-level Voronoi-based encoding uses a spatial hierarchical K-means over interest-point locations and computes a content-based descriptor over each cell. In order to reduce the matching complexity with minimal or no sacrifice in retrieval performance (i) we utilize the tree structure of the spatial hierarchical K-means to perform a top-to-bottom pruning for local similarity maxima; (ii) we propose a new image similarity score that combines relevant information from all partition levels into a single measure for similarity; (iii) we combine our proposal with a novel and efficient approach for optimal bit allocation within quantized descriptor representations. By deriving both a Voronoi-based VLAD descriptor (termed as Fast-VVLAD) and a Voronoi-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptor (termed as Fast-VDCNN) we demonstrate that our Voronoi-based framework is agnostic to the descriptor basis and can easily be slotted into existing frameworks. Via a range of ROI queries in two standard datasets it is shown that the Voronoi-based descriptors achieve comparable or higher mean Average Precision against conventional grid-based spatial search while offering more than two-fold reduction in complexity. Finally beyond ROI queries we show that Voronoi partitioning improves the geometric invariance of compact CNN descriptors thereby resulting in competitive performance to the current state-of-the-art on whole image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Binary hashing is a well-known approach for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in information retrieval. Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable but it also improves over the more complex coupled objective function and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.</p>

In particular SMFH employs a well-designed binary code learning algorithm to preserve the similarities among multi-modal original features through a graph regularization. At the same time semantic labels when available are incorporated into the learning procedure.

existing work on cross-modal hashing does not capture the
spatial dependency of images and temporal dynamics of text
sentences for learning powerful feature representations and
cross-modal embeddings that mitigate the heterogeneity of
different modalities. This paper presents a new Deep Visual Semantic Hashing (DVSH) model that generates compact
hash codes of images and sentences in an end-to-end deep
learning architecture, which capture the intrinsic cross-modal
correspondences between visual data and natural language.
DVSH is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a visual semantic fusion network for learning joint embedding space
of images and text sentences, and two modality-specific hashing networks for learning hash functions to generate compact
binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint multimodal embedding and cross-modal hashing, which is based
on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks
over images, Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and
a structured max-margin objective that integrates all things
together to enable learning of similarity-preserving and highquality hash codes. Extensive empirical evidence shows that
our DVSH approach yields state of the art results in crossmodal retrieval experiments on image-sentences datasets,

Our paper focuses on this latter setting and explores several methods for learning patch descriptors without supervision with application to matching and instance-level retrieval. To that effect we propose a new family of convolutional descriptors for patch representation based on the recently introduced convolutional kernel networks. We show that our descriptor named Patch-CKN performs better than SIFT as well as other convolutional networks learned by artificially introducing supervision and is significantly faster to train. To demonstrate its effectiveness we perform an extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks for patch and image retrieval where we obtain state-of-the-art results.

However universality fails to ensure that all hash functions are well behaved. We further require regularity when picking data objects at random they should have a low probability of having the same hash value for any fixed hash function. We present the efficient implementation of a family of non-cryptographic hash functions (PM+) offering good running times good memory usage as well as distinguishing theoretical guarantees almost universality and component-wise regularity.

	<td><p>We provide a variant of cross-polytope locality sensitive hashing with respect to angular distance which is provably optimal in asymptotic sensitivity and enjoys (d ln d ) hash computation time. Building on a recent result (by Andoni Indyk Laarhoven Razenshteyn Schmidt 2015) we show that optimal asymptotic sensitivity for cross-polytope LSH is retained even when the dense Gaussian matrix is replaced by a fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform followed by discrete pseudo-rotation reducing the hash computation time from (d^2) to (d ln d ). Moreover our scheme achieves the optimal rate of convergence for sensitivity. By incorporating a low-randomness Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform our scheme can be modified to require only (ln^9(d)) random bits</p>

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed extensive attention in binary code learning a.k.a. hashing for nearest neighbor search problems. It has been seen that high-dimensional data points can be quantized into binary codes to give an efficient similarity approximation via Hamming distance. Among existing schemes ranking-based hashing is recent promising that targets at preserving ordinal relations of ranking in the Hamming space to minimize retrieval loss. However the size of the ranking tuples which shows the ordinal relations is quadratic or cubic to the size of training samples. By given a large-scale training data set it is very expensive to embed such ranking tuples in binary code learning. Besides it remains a dificulty to build ranking tuples efficiently for most ranking-preserving hashing which are deployed over an ordinal graph-based setting. To handle these problems we propose a novel ranking-preserving hashing method dubbed Ordinal Constraint Hashing (OCH) which efficiently learns the optimal hashing functions with a graph-based approximation to embed the ordinal relations. The core idea is to reduce the size of ordinal graph with ordinal constraint projection which preserves the ordinal relations through a small data set (such as clusters or random samples). In particular to learn such hash functions effectively we further relax the discrete constraints and design a specific stochastic gradient decent algorithm for optimization. Experimental results on three large-scale visual search benchmark datasets i.e. LabelMe Tiny100K and GIST1M show that the proposed OCH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in many areas of machine learning and data mining. During the past decade numerous hashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm claims outperform other state-of-the-art hashing methods. However the evaluation of these hashing papers was not thorough enough and those claims should be re-examined. The ultimate goal of an ANNS method is returning the most accurate answers (nearest neighbors) in the shortest time. If implemented correctly almost all the hashing methods will have their performance improved as the code length increases. However many existing hashing papers only report the performance with the code length shorter than 128. In this paper we carefully revisit the problem of search with a hash index and analyze the pros and cons of two popular hash index search procedures. Then we proposed a very simple but effective two level index structures and make a thorough comparison of eleven popular hashing algorithms. Surprisingly the random-projection-based Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the best performed algorithm which is in contradiction to the claims in all the other ten hashing papers. Despite the extreme simplicity of random-projection-based LSH our results show that the capability of this algorithm has been far underestimated. For the sake of reproducibility all the codes used in the paper are released on GitHub which can be used as a testing platform for a fair comparison between various hashing algorithms.</p>

These limitations are most evident when arbitrary search words are used that do not intersect with training set labels. Weak labels from user generated content (UGC) found in the wild (e.g. Google Photos FlickR etc.) have an almost unlimited number of unique words in the metadata tags. Prior work on word embeddings successfully leveraged unstructured text with large vocabularies and our proposed method seeks to apply similar cost functions to open source imagery. Specifically we train a deep learning image tagging and retrieval system on large scale user generated content (UGC) using sampling methods and joint optimization of word embeddings. By using the Yahoo! FlickR Creative Commons (YFCC100M) dataset such an approach builds robustness to common unstructured data issues that include but are not limited to irrelevant tags misspellings multiple languages polysemy and tag imbalance. As a result the final proposed algorithm will not only yield comparable results to state of the art in conventional image tagging but will enable new capability to train algorithms on large scale unstructured text in the YFCC100M dataset and outperform cited work in zero-shot capability.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimodal retrieval with storage and computation efficiency. Cross-modal hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting semantic correlations across different modalities. Existing cross-modal hashing methods first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors and then generate binary codes by another separate quantization step. However suboptimal hash codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes. This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal hashing which jointly learns good data representation tailored to hash coding and formally controls the quantization error. The proposed CHN is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good image representations a multilayer perception for learning good text representations two hashing layers for generating compact binary codes and a structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical study shows that CHN yields state of the art cross-modal retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>The rise of internet has resulted in an explosion of data consisting of millions of articles images songs and videos. Most of this data is high dimensional and sparse. The need to perform an efficient search for similar objects in such high dimensional big datasets is becoming increasingly common. Even with the rapid growth in computing power the brute-force search for such a task is impractical and at times impossible. Therefore it is quite natural to investigate the techniques that compress the dimension of the data-set while preserving the similarity between data objects. In this work we propose an efficient compression scheme mapping binary vectors into binary vectors and simultaneously preserving Hamming distance and Inner Product. The length of our compression depends only on the sparsity and is independent of the dimension of the data. Moreover our schemes provide one-shot solution for Hamming distance and Inner Product and work in the streaming setting as well. In contrast with the local projection strategies used by most of the previous schemes our scheme combines (using sparsity) the following two strategies 1. Partitioning the dimensions into several buckets 2. Then obtaining global linear summaries in each of these buckets. We generalize our scheme for real-valued data and obtain compressions for Euclidean distance Inner Product and k-way Inner Product.</p>

Furthermore storing similar raw images together enables rapid data sorting searching and retrieval if the images are stored in a distributed and large-scale envi- ronment by reducing fragmentation.

However the existing limitations make the present algorithms difficult to deal with large-scale datasets (1) discrete constraints are involved in the learning of the hash function; (2) pairwise or triplet similarity is adopted to generate efficient hashcodes resulting both time and space complexity are greater than O(n^2). To address these issues we propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be scalable to large-scale datasets. First the discrete learning procedure is decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and binary codes learning scheme which makes the learning procedure more efficient. Second we adopt the Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based Batch Coordinate Descent method such that the time and space complexity is reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to incorporate with arbitrary hash function including deep neural networks and kernel methods. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior or comparable with state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p>

In contrast to previous works employing pre-trained deep networks as a black box to produce features our method leverages a deep architecture trained for the specific task of image retrieval. Our contribution is twofold (i) we leverage a ranking framework to learn convolution and projection weights that are used to build the region features; and (ii) we employ a region proposal network to learn which regions should be pooled to form the final global descriptor. We show that using clean training data is key to the success of our approach. To that aim we use a large scale but noisy landmark dataset and develop an automatic cleaning approach. The proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single forward pass. Our approach significantly outperforms previous approaches based on global descriptors on standard datasets.

We further show application of LOH to a) large-scale search tasks where performance is on par with other state-of-the-art hashing approaches; b) large-scale recommendation where queries consisting of thousands of images can be used to generate accurate recommendations from collections of hundreds of millions of images; and c) efficient clustering with a graph-based algorithm that can be scaled to massive collections in a distributed environment or can be used for deduplication for small collections like search results performing better than traditional hashing approaches while only requiring a few milliseconds to run.

The proposed distance is more robust to rotations and translations of images than the traditional manifold distance and the CW-SSIM index based distance. In addition the proposed distance is combined with the k-medoids clustering method to derive a new clustering method for visual object categorization.

	<td><p>Learning hash functions/codes for similarity search over multi-view data is attracting increasing attention where similar hash codes are assigned to the data objects characterizing consistently neighborhood relationship across views. Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three limitations 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix is first constructed followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these methods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with multiple representations are noise-freewhich is not practical in real-life applications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the neighborhood graph construction using all N points in the database (O(N)). In this paper we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the robust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations which may be noise corrupted. To achieve both the robustness and training efficiency we propose an approach to effectively and efficiently learning low-rank kernelized hash functions shared across views. Specifically we utilize landmark graphs to construct tractable similarity matrices in multi-views to automatically discover neighborhood structure in the data. To learn robust hash functions a latent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to accommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular a latent kernelized similarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based similarity matrices. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets validate the efficacy of our method in the presence of error corruptions.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search on time series is a frequent operation in large-scale data-driven applications. Sophisticated similarity measures are standard for time series matching as they are usually misaligned. Dynamic Time Warping or DTW is the most widely used similarity measure for time series because it combines alignment and matching at the same time. However the alignment makes DTW slow. To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW branch and bound based pruning strategies are adopted. However branch and bound based pruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series) and the bounds are quite weak for longer queries. Due to the loose bounds branch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search. To circumvent this issue we design SSH (Sketch Shingle Hashing) an efficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the state-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique the UCR suite. SSH uses a novel combination of sketching shingling and hashing techniques to produce (probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity measure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for sub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time sequence and prunes around 95 candidates leading to the massive speedup in search with DTW. Empirical results on two large-scale benchmark time series data show that our proposed method can be around 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art package (UCR suite) without any significant loss in accuracy.</p>

	<td><p>By leveraging semantic (label) information, supervised hashing has demonstrated better accuracy than unsupervised hashing in many real applications. Because the hashing-code learning problem is essentially a discrete optimization problem which is hard to solve, most existing supervised hashing methods try to solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by dropping the discrete constraints.
However, these methods typically suffer from poor performance due to the errors caused by the relaxation. Some other methods try to directly solve the discrete optimization problem. However, they are typically time-consuming and unscalable. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called column sampling based discrete supervised hashing (COSDISH), to directly learn the discrete hashing code from semantic information.
COSDISH is an iterative method, in each iteration of which several columns are sampled from the semantic similarity matrix and then the hashing code is decomposed into two parts which can be alternately optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the storage and retrieval efficiency, hashing has been widely deployed to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimedia retrieval. Supervised hashing, which improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs, has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval, an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features, followed by another separate quantization step that generates binary codes.
However, suboptimal hash coding may be produced, because the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the binary coding. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Hashing Network (DHN) architecture for supervised hashing, in which we jointly learn good image representation tailored to hash coding and formally control the quantization error.
The DHN model constitutes four key components: (1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture image representations; (2) a fully-connected hashing layer to generate compact binary hash codes; (3) a pairwise cross-entropy loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a pairwise quantization loss for controlling hashing quality. Extensive experiments on standard image retrieval datasets show the proposed DHN model yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>In applications involving matching of image sets the information from multiple images must be effectively exploited to represent each set. State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a set and use specific distance measure to compare two sets. These methods are slow to compute and not compact to use in a large scale scenario. Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be used to efficiently compare two samples. However most hashing methods encode each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same set represent the same object or person. We investigate the set hashing problem by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image features then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming set similarity relations using class labels. We extensively evaluate our approach on datasets used for image matching and show highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a feature representation which is built as a combination of three local descriptors.

In the latter approach a permutation may be coded in order to achieve locality. This paper focuses on the combinatorial approach.

	<td><p>Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems have been widely used for a wide range of applications such as Art collections Crime prevention and Intellectual property. In this paper a novel CBIR system which utilizes visual contents (color texture and shape) of an image to retrieve images is proposed. The proposed system builds three feature vectors and stores them into MySQL database. The first feature vector uses descriptive statistics to describe the distribution of data in each channel of RGB channels of the image. The second feature vector describes the texture using eigenvalues of the 39 sub-bands that are generated after applying four levels 2D DWT in each channel (red green and blue channels) of the image. These wavelets sub-bands perfectly describes the horizontal vertical and diagonal edges that exist in the multi-resolution analysis of the image. The third feature vector describes the basic shapes that exist in the skeletonization version of the black and white representation of the image. Experimental results on a private MYSQL database that consists of 10000 images using color texture shape and stored relevance feedbacks showed 96.4 average correct retrieval rate in an efficient recovery time.</p>

Existing methods in this context train relatively âshallowâ networks limited by the issues arising in back propagation (e.e. vanishing gradients) as well as computational efficiency. We propose a novel and efficient training algorithm inspired by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that overcomes some of these limitations. Our method decomposes the training process into independent layer-wise local updates through auxiliary variables. Empirically we observe that our training algorithm always converges and its computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the networks. Empirically we manage to train DNNs with 64 hidden layers and 1024 nodes per layer for supervised hashing in about 3 hours using a single GPU. Our proposed very deep supervised hashing (VDSH) method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Given a large dataset of binary codes and a binary query point we address how to efficiently find K codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine similarities to the query. The straightforward answer to this problem is to compare the query with all items in the dataset but this is practical only for small datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the nearest neighbors. However if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance then the main issue is that the order of buckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue we first elaborate on the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table. However solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only practical for short binary codes. To address this issue we propose the angular multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash tables on binary code substrings. The proposed search algorithm solves the exact angular K nearest neighbor problem in a time that is often orders of magnitude faster than the linear scan baseline and even approximation methods.</p>

	<td><p>One of the basic tasks in bioinformatics is localizing a short subsequence S read while sequencing in a long reference sequence R like the human geneome. A natural rapid approach would be finding a hash value for S and compare it with a prepared database of hash values for each of length S subsequences of R. The problem with such approach is that it would only spot a perfect match while in reality there are lots of small changes substitutions deletions and insertions. This issue could be repaired if having a hash function designed to tolerate some small distortion accordingly to an alignment metric (like Needleman-Wunch) designed to make that two similar sequences should most likely give the same hash value. This paper discusses construction of Distortion-Resistant Hashing (DRH) to generate such fingerprints for rapid search of similar subsequences. The proposed approach is based on the rate distortion theory in a nearly uniform subset of length S sequences the hash value represents the closest sequence to S. This gives some control of the distance of collisions sequences having the same hash value.</p>

We show that such operations can be performed in a simple and piecewise-differentiable manner using 1D histograms with soft assignment operations.

The empirical results also demonstrate that the NGMM kernel typically outperforms the GInt kernel.

	<td><p>Hashing has shown its efficiency and effectiveness in facilitating large-scale multimedia applications. Supervised knowledge e.g. semantic labels or pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However confronted with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the Web existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual labelling. In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme termed (ZSH) which compresses images of unseen categories to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of seen categories. Specifically we project independent data labels i.e. 0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space where semantic relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover in order to cope with the semantic shift problem we rotate the embedded space to more suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime to exert positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions we further propose to preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes. Besides we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-based image hashing represents crucial technique for visual data storage reduction and expedited image search. Conventional hashing schemes typically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions which separates the procedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and non-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image classification and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks. On all benchmarks our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular our algorithm achieves a near-perfect 0.99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy with only 12 bits on MNIST and a new record of 0.74 on the CIFAR10 dataset. In comparison the best accuracies obtained on CIFAR10 by existing hashing algorithms without or with deep networks are known to be 0.36 and 0.58 respectively.</p>

The proposed approach employs the normalized Radon projections with corresponding image category labels to build an SVM classifier and the Radon barcode database which encodes every image in a binary format is also generated simultaneously to tag all images. To retrieve similar images when a query image is given Radon projections and the barcode of the query image are generated. Subsequently the k-nearest neighbor search method is applied to find the images with minimum Hamming distance of the Radon barcode within the same class predicted by the trained SVM classifier that uses Radon features. The performance of the proposed method is validated by using the IRMA 2009 dataset with 14410 x-ray images in 57 categories. The results demonstrate that our method has the capacity to retrieve similar responses for the correctly identified query image and even for those mistakenly classified by SVM. The approach further is very fast and has low memory requirement.</p>

In ITQ+ a new slack function is learned from auxiliary data to approximate the quantization error in ITQ.

	<td><p>Weighted minwise hashing (WMH) is one of the fundamental subroutine required by many celebrated approximation algorithms commonly adopted in industrial practice for large scale-search and learning. The resource bottleneck of the algorithms is the computation of multiple (typically a few hundreds to thousands) independent hashes of the data. The fastest hashing algorithm is by Ioffe which requires one pass over the entire data vector O(d) (d is the number of non-zeros) for computing one hash. However the requirement of multiple hashes demands hundreds or thousands passes over the data. This is very costly for modern massive dataset. In this work we break this expensive barrier and show an expected constant amortized time algorithm which computes k independent and unbiased WMH in time O(k) instead of O(dk) required by Ioffes method. Moreover our proposal only needs a few bits (5 - 9 bits) of storage per hash value compared to around 64 bits required by the state-of-art-methodologies. Experimental evaluations on real datasets show that for computing 500 WMH our proposal can be 60000x faster than the Ioffes method without losing any accuracy. Our method is also around 100x faster than approximate heuristics capitalizing on the efficient densified one permutation hashing schemes . Given the simplicity of our approach and its significant advantages we hope that it will replace existing implementations in practice.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence of massive databases containing images from a diverse range of modalities. This has significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images on one side and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systems on the other side. Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as a potential vehicle to achieve these goals. One of the recently introduced binary descriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes (RBCs) that are driven from Radon transform via local thresholding. Gabor transform is also a powerful transform to extract texture-based information. Gabor features have exhibited robustness against rotation scale and also photometric disturbances such as illumination changes and image noise in many applications. This paper introduces Gabor Barcodes (GBCs) as a novel framework for the image annotation. To find the most discriminative GBC for a given query image the effects of employing Gabor filters with different parameters i.e. different sets of scales and orientations are investigated resulting in different barcode lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method has been evaluated on the IRMA dataset with 193 classes comprising of 12677 x-ray images for indexing and 1733 x-rays images for testing. A total error score as low as 351 (approx 80 accuracy for the first hit) was achieved.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is one of the most popular and powerful approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for large-scale image retrieval. Most traditional hashing methods first represent images as off-the-shelf visual features and then produce hashing codes in a separate stage. However off-the-shelf visual features may not be optimally compatible with the hash code learning procedure which may result in sub-optimal hash codes. Recently deep hashing methods have been proposed to simultaneously learn image features and hash codes using deep neural networks and have shown superior performance over traditional hashing methods. Most deep hashing methods are given supervised information in the form of pairwise labels or triplet labels. The current state-of-the-art deep hashing method DPSH~ which is based on pairwise labels performs image feature learning and hash code learning simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of pairwise similarities. Inspired by DPSH~ we propose a triplet label based deep hashing method which aims to maximize the likelihood of the given triplet labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all the baselines on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets including the state-of-the-art method DPSH~ and all the previous triplet label based deep hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient hard sample mining is usually employed with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.</p>

	<td><p>The method of random projections has become a standard tool for machine learning data mining and search with massive data at Web scale. The effective use of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing (real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper we focus on a simple 2-bit coding scheme. In particular we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important practical applications. For example in the task of near neighbor search a crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed coding scheme and estimator. As a related task in this paper we also study a simple uniform quantization scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For example when the target similarity level is high 2 or 3 bits might be sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high it is preferable to use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good choice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash tables. Combining these results we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be recommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation. Extensive experimental results are provided.</p>

We show that the SDH model can be simplified without performance degradation based on some preliminary experiments; we call the approximate model for this the Fast SDH (FSDH) model. We analyze the FSDH model and provide a mathematically exact solution for it. In contrast to SDH our model does not require an alternating optimization algorithm and does not depend on initial values. FSDH is also easier to implement than Iterative Quantization (ITQ). Experimental results involving a large-scale database showed that FSDH outperforms conventional SDH in terms of precision recall and computation time.</p>

However how to learn deep representations that strongly preserve similarities between data pairs and can be accurately quantized via vector quantization remains a challenging task. Existing methods simply leverage quantization loss and similarity loss which result in unexpectedly biased back-propagating gradients and affect the search performances. To this end we propose a novel gradient snapping layer (GSL) to directly regularize the back-propagating gradient towards a neighboring codeword the generated gradients are un-biased for reducing similarity loss and also propel the learned representations to be accurately quantized. Joint deep representation and vector quantization learning can be easily performed by alternatively optimize the quantization codebook and the deep neural network. The proposed framework is compatible with various existing vector quantization approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art large scale similarity search methods.</p>

	<td><p>Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search technique for high-dimensional feature indexing and retrieval is the crux of large-scale image retrieval. A recent promising technique is Product Quantization which attempts to index high-dimensional image features by decomposing the feature space into a Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and quantizing each of them separately. Despite the promising results reported their quantization approach follows the typical hard assignment of traditional quantization methods which may result in large quantization errors and thus inferior search performance. Unlike the existing approaches in this paper we propose a novel approach called Sparse Product Quantization (SPQ) to encoding the high-dimensional feature vectors into sparse representation. We optimize the sparse representations of the feature vectors by minimizing their quantization errors making the resulting representation is essentially close to the original data in practice. Experiments show that the proposed SPQ technique is not only able to compress data but also an effective encoding technique. We obtain state-of-the-art results for ANN search on four public image datasets and the promising results of content-based image retrieval further validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

As a defining property our method represents both the images and learned classifiers using binary hash codes which are simultaneously learned from the training data. Classifying an image thereby reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the binary codes of the image and classifiers and selecting the class with minimal Hamming distance. Conventionally compact hash codes are primarily used for accelerating image search. Our work is first of its kind to represent classifiers using binary codes. Specifically we formulate multi-class image classification as an optimization problem over binary variables. The optimization alternatively proceeds over the binary classifiers and image hash codes. Profiting from the special property of binary codes we show that the sub-problems can be efficiently solved through either a binary quadratic program (BQP) or linear program. In particular for attacking the BQP problem we propose a novel bit-flipping procedure which enjoys high efficacy and local optimality guarantee. Our formulation supports a large family of empirical loss functions and is here instantiated by exponential / hinge losses. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on several representative image benchmarks. The experiments consistently observe reduced complexities of model training and deployment without sacrifice of accuracies.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing methods have attracted much attention for large scale image retrieval. Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently. However existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one hand a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to the discrete Hamming distance which raises a critical issue of image retrieval where fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand different hash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently and treating them equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the above two problems we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH) approach which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by weighted Hamming distance. First a novel deep hashing network is proposed to learn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly so that the learned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different image classes. Second a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed which rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing its semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image retrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance which can provide more accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance. Experiments on four widely used datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms eight state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

This framework can be used for image retrieval as a drop-in replacement for other keypoint detectors and descriptors enabling more accurate feature matching and geometric verification. Our system produces reliable confidence scores to reject false positivesâin particular it is robust against queries that have no correct match in the database. To evaluate the proposed descriptor we introduce a new large-scale dataset referred to as Google-Landmarks dataset which involves challenges in both database and query such as background clutter partial occlusion multiple landmarks objects in variable scales etc. We show that DELF outperforms the state-of-the-art global and local descriptors in the large-scale setting by significant margins.

	<td><p>Hashing methods aim to learn a set of hash functions which map the original features to compact binary codes with similarity preserving in the Hamming space. Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information retrieval. We propose a column generation based binary code learning framework for data-dependent hash function learning. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise similarity comparison information our column generation based method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relations within the large-margin learning framework. Our method iteratively learns the best hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or graph Laplacian related loss functions instead of the performance evaluation criteria of interestâmultivariate performance measures such as the AUC and NDCG. Our column generation based method can be further generalized from the triplet loss to a general structured learning based framework that allows one to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. For optimizing general ranking measures the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially or infinitely many variables and constraints which is more challenging than standard structured output learning. We use a combination of column generation and cutting-plane techniques to solve the optimization problem. To speed-up the training we further explore stage-wise training and propose to use a simplified NDCG loss for efficient inference. We demonstrate the generality of our method by applying it to ranking prediction and image retrieval and show that it outperforms a few state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

Examining similar images may provide clues to the expert to remove uncertainties in his/her final diagnosis. Beyond conventional feature descriptors binary features in different ways have been recently proposed to encode the image content. A recent proposal is Radon barcodes that employ binarized Radon projections to tag/annotate medical images with content-based binary vectors called barcodes. In this paper MinMax Radon barcodes are introduced which are superior to local thresholding scheme suggested in the literature. Using IRMA dataset with 14410 x-ray images from 193 different classes the advantage of using MinMax Radon barcodes over Radon barcodes are demonstrated. The retrieval error for direct search drops by more than 15. As well SURF as a well-established non-binary approach and BRISK as a recent binary method are examined to compare their results with MinMax Radon barcodes when retrieving images from IRMA dataset. The results demonstrate that MinMax Radon barcodes are faster and more accurate when applied on IRMA images.</p>

We propose to train the network with triplets of patches that include a positive and negative pairs. To that end we introduce a new loss function that exploits the relations within the triplets.

In this paper manifold learning and Gestalt psychology theory are involved to solve the incompatibility problem. A new holistic descriptor called Perceptual Uniform Descriptor (PUD) based on Gestalt psychology is proposed which combines color and gradient direction to imitate the human visual uniformity. PUD features in the same class images distributes on one manifold in most cases because PUD improves the visual uniformity of the traditional descriptors. Thus we use manifold ranking and PUD to realize image retrieval. Experiments were carried out on five benchmark data sets and the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of image retrieval. Our experimental results in the Ukbench and Corel-1K datasets demonstrated that N-S score reached to 3.58 (HSV 3.4) and mAP to 81.77 (ODBTC 77.9) respectively by utilizing PUD which has only 280 dimension. The results are higher than other holistic image descriptors (even some local ones) and state-of-the-arts retrieval methods.</p>

Different from the traditional desktop search mobile visual search needs more consideration for the limited resources on mobile devices (e.g. bandwidth computing power and memory consumption). The state-of-the-art approaches show that bag-of-words (BoW) model is robust for image and video retrieval; however the large vocabulary tree might not be able to be loaded on the mobile device. We observe that recent works mainly focus on designing compact feature representations on mobile devices for bandwidth-limited network (e.g. 3G) and directly adopt feature matching on remote servers (cloud). However the compact (binary) representation might fail to retrieve target objects (images videos). Based on the hashed binary codes we propose a de-hashing process that reconstructs BoW by leveraging the computing power of remote servers. To mitigate the information loss from binary codes we further utilize contextual information (e.g. GPS) to reconstruct a context-aware BoW for better retrieval results. Experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve competitive retrieval accuracy as BoW while only transmitting few bits from mobile devices.</p>

Considering the scale of modern datasets hashing is favorable for its low complexity. However most existing hashing methods are designed to preserve one single kind of similarity thus improper for dealing with the different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation we propose a new hashing method named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH) which jointly preserves the category and attribute similarities by exploiting the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to hierarchically capture the correlations between category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels are scarce our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework the binary codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network outputs of a binary-like layer and the attributes can be recovered from the codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval task while being more compact than the compared methods.</p>

This technique is based on comparing the permutations of some reference objects in place of the original metric distance. However the Achilles heel of STR approach is the need to reorder the result set of the search according to the metric distance. This forces to use a support database to store the original objects which requires efficient random I/O on a fast secondary memory (such as flash-based storages). In this paper we propose to extend the Surrogate Text Representation to specifically address a class of visual metric objects known as Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD). This approach is based on representing the individual sub-vectors forming the VLAD vector with the STR providing a finer representation of the vector and enabling us to get rid of the reordering phase. The experiments on a publicly available dataset show that the extended STR outperforms the baseline STR achieving satisfactory performance near to the one obtained with the original VLAD vectors.</p>

This poses obvious efficiency problems when using inverted files to perform efficient image matching.

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a commonly used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval. For image retrieval deep-networks-based hashing methods are appealing since they can simultaneously learn effective image representations and compact hash codes. This paper focuses on deep-networks-based hashing for multi-label images each of which may contain objects of multiple categories. In most existing hashing methods each image is represented by one piece of hash code which is referred to as semantic hashing. This setting may be suboptimal for multi-label image retrieval. To solve this problem we propose a deep architecture that learns image representations for multi-label image data which are organized in multiple groups with each group containing the features for one category. The instance-aware representations not only bring advantages to semantic hashing but also can be used in category-aware hashing in which an image is represented by multiple pieces of hash codes and each piece of code corresponds to a category. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that for both semantic hashing and category-aware hashing the proposed method shows substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>While state-of-the-art kernels for graphs with discrete labels scale well to graphs with thousands of nodes the few existing kernels for graphs with continuous attributes unfortunately do not scale well. To overcome this limitation we present hash graph kernels a general framework to derive kernels for graphs with continuous attributes from discrete ones. The idea is to iteratively turn continuous attributes into discrete labels using randomized hash functions. We illustrate hash graph kernels for the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and for the shortest-path kernel. The resulting novel graph kernels are shown to be both able to handle graphs with continuous attributes and scalable to large graphs and data sets. This is supported by our theoretical analysis and demonstrated by an extensive experimental evaluation.</p>

	<td><p>User-given tags or labels are valuable resources for semantic understanding of visual media such as images and videos. Recently a new type of labeling mechanism known as hash-tags have become increasingly popular on social media sites. In this paper we study the problem of generating relevant and useful hash-tags for short video clips. Traditional data-driven approaches for tag enrichment and recommendation use direct visual similarity for label transfer and propagation. We attempt to learn a direct low-cost mapping from video to hash-tags using a two step training process. We first employ a natural language processing (NLP) technique skip-gram models with neural network training to learn a low-dimensional vector representation of hash-tags (Tag2Vec) using a corpus of 10 million hash-tags. We then train an embedding function to map video features to the low-dimensional Tag2vec space. We learn this embedding for 29 categories of short video clips with hash-tags. A query video without any tag-information can then be directly mapped to the vector space of tags using the learned embedding and relevant tags can be found by performing a simple nearest-neighbor retrieval in the Tag2Vec space. We validate the relevance of the tags suggested by our system qualitatively and quantitatively with a user study.</p>

In contrast to conventional hashing schemes which typically rely on an ell_2-norm (i.e. average distortion) minimization NIBH is based on a ell_infty-norm (i.e. worst-case distortion) minimization that provides several benefits including superior distance ranking and near-neighbor preservation performance. We develop a practical and efficient algorithm for NIBH based on column generation that scales well to large datasets.

	<td><p>Content-Based Image Retrieval based on local features is computationally expensive because of the complexity of both extraction and matching of local feature. On one hand the cost for extracting representing and comparing local visual descriptors has been dramatically reduced by recently proposed binary local features. On the other hand aggregation techniques provide a meaningful summarization of all the extracted feature of an image into a single descriptor allowing us to speed up and scale up the image search. Only a few works have recently mixed together these two research directions defining aggregation methods for binary local features in order to leverage on the advantage of both approaches. In this paper we report an extensive comparison among state-of-the-art aggregation methods applied to binary features. Then we mathematically formalize the application of Fisher Kernels to Bernoulli Mixture Models. Finally we investigate the combination of the aggregated binary features with the emerging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. Our results show that aggregation methods on binary features are effective and represent a worthwhile alternative to the direct matching. Moreover the combination of the CNN with the Fisher Vector (FV) built upon binary features allowed us to obtain a relative improvement over the CNN results that is in line with that recently obtained using the combination of the CNN with the FV built upon SIFTs. The advantage of using the FV built upon binary features is that the extraction process of binary features is about two order of magnitude faster than SIFTs.</p>

For each entry in a deep net FunHashNN uses multiple low-cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. FunHashNN includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated case and benefits from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss.

	<td><p>Hashing methods have been widely used for efficient similarity retrieval on large scale image database. Traditional hashing methods learn hash functions to generate binary codes from hand-crafted features which achieve limited accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently several deep hashing methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate more discriminative feature representations. However these deep hashing methods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios which only exploit the semantic similarity information but ignore the underlying data structures. In this paper we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach to perform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving semantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are as follows (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the empirical error on labeled data as well as the embedding error on both labeled and unlabeled data which can preserve the semantic similarity and capture the meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing. (2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit both labeled and unlabeled data in which we propose an online graph construction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training to better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge the proposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash code learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion. Experimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

In the first stage of classification binary codes are considered as class labels by a set of binary SVMs; each corresponds to one bit. In the second stage binary codes become the input space of a multi-class SVM. Hash functions are learned by an efficient algorithm where the NP-hard problem of finding optimal binary codes is solved via cyclic coordinate descent and SVMs are trained in a parallelized incremental manner. For modifications like adding images from a previously unseen class we describe an incremental procedure for effective and efficient updates to the previous hash functions.

Recently image representations based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this time of rapid evolution this article provides a comprehensive survey of instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories SIFT-based and CNN-based methods are presented. For the former according to the codebook size we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks. For the latter we discuss three lines of methods i.e. using pre-trained or fine-tuned CNN models and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass of an image to the network while the last category employs a patch-based feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance retrieval reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods. After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories on several datasets we discuss promising directions towards generic and specialized instance retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a popular data-independent indexing method for approximate similarity search where random projections followed by quantization hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. Most of high-dimensional visual descriptors for images exhibit a natural matrix structure. When visual descriptors are represented by high-dimensional feature vectors and long binary codes are assigned a random projection matrix requires expensive complexities in both space and time. In this paper we analyze a bilinear random projection method where feature matrices are transformed to binary codes by two smaller random projection matrices. We base our theoretical analysis on extending Raginsky and Lazebniks result where random Fourier features are composed with random binary quantizers to form locality sensitive binary codes. To this end we answer the following two questions (1) whether a bilinear random projection also yields similarity-preserving binary codes; (2) whether a bilinear random projection yields performance gain or loss compared to a large linear projection. Regarding the first question we present upper and lower bounds on the expected Hamming distance between binary codes produced by bilinear random projections. In regards to the second question we analyze the upper and lower bounds on covariance between two bits of binary codes showing that the correlation between two bits is small. Numerical experiments on MNIST and Flickr45K datasets confirm the validity of our method.</p>

	<td><p>Deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to image classification tasks. When these same networks have been applied to image retrieval the assumption has been made that the last layers would give the best performance as they do in classification. We show that for instance-level image retrieval lower layers often perform better than the last layers in convolutional neural networks. We present an approach for extracting convolutional features from different layers of the networks and adopt VLAD encoding to encode features into a single vector for each image. We investigate the effect of different layers and scales of input images on the performance of convolutional features using the recent deep networks OxfordNet and GoogLeNet. Experiments demonstrate that intermediate layers or higher layers with finer scales produce better results for image retrieval compared to the last layer. When using compressed 128-D VLAD descriptors our method obtains state-of-the-art results and outperforms other VLAD and CNN based approaches on two out of three test datasets. Our work provides guidance for transferring deep networks trained on image classification to image retrieval tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing, as a popular approximate nearest neighbor
search, has been widely used for large-scale similarity search. Recently, a spectrum of machine learning
methods are utilized to learn similarity-preserving
binary codes. However, most of them directly encode the explicit features, keywords, which fail to
preserve the accurate semantic similarities in binary code beyond keyword matching, especially on
short texts. Here we propose a novel text hashing
framework with convolutional neural networks. In
particular, we first embed the keyword features into
compact binary code with a locality preserving constraint. Meanwhile word features and position features are together fed into a convolutional network to
learn the implicit features which are further incorporated with the explicit features to fit the pre-trained
binary code. Such base method can be successfully
accomplished without any external tags/labels, and
other three model variations are designed to integrate tags/labels. Experimental results show the
superiority of our proposed approach over several
state-of-the-art hashing methods when tested on one
short text dataset as well as one normal text dataset.</p>

For balanced allocations keys are hashed into a hash table where each bucket can hold multiple keys and each key is placed in the least loaded of d choices. It has been shown previously that asymptotically the performance of double hashing and fully random hashing is the same in the balanced allocation paradigm using fluid limit methods. Here we extend a coupling argument used by Lueker and Molodowitch to show that double hashing and ideal uniform hashing are asymptotically equivalent in the setting of open address hash tables to the balanced allocation setting providing further insight into this phenomenon. We also discuss the potential for and bottlenecks limiting the use this approach for other multiple choice hashing schemes.</p>

We present a surprisingly simple solution called a split index which is based on the Dirichlet principle for matching a keyword with few mismatches and experimentally show that it offers competitive space-time tradeoffs. Our implementation in the C++ language is focused mostly on data compaction which is beneficial for the search speed (e.g. by being cache friendly). We compare our solution with other algorithms and we show that it performs better for the Hamming distance. Query times in the order of 1 microsecond were reported for one mismatch for the dictionary size of a few megabytes on a medium-end PC. We also demonstrate that a basic compression technique consisting in q-gram substitution can significantly reduce the index size (up to 50 of the input text size for the DNA) while still keeping the query time relatively low.</p>

	<td><p>Randomized algorithms and data structures are often analyzed under the assumption of access to a perfect source of randomness. The most fundamental metric used to measure how random a hash function or a random number generator is is its independence a sequence of random variables is said to be k-independent if every variable is uniform and every size k subset is independent. In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited independence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort min-wise hashing and largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be summarized as follows. -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a 5-independent hash function Karloff and Raghavan J.ACM93 showed O ( n log n) expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort. We improve upon this showing that the same running time is achieved with only 4-independence. -Min-wise hashing. For a set A consider the probability of a particular element being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that 5-independence implies the optimal probability O (1 /n). Broder et al. STOC98 showed that 2-independence implies it is O(1 / ). We show a matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for 3- and 4-independent hash functions. -Largest bucket. We consider the case where n balls are distributed to n buckets using a k-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket size. Alon et. al STOC97 showed that there exists a 2-independent hash function implying a bucket of size Omega ( n^1/2). We generalize the bound providing a k-independent family of functions that imply size Omega ( n^1/k).</p>

In high-dimensional spaces many conventional methods suffer from excessive usage of memory and slow response times. We propose a method where multiple random projection trees are combined by a novel voting scheme. The key idea is to exploit the redundancy in a large number of candidate sets obtained by independently generated random projections in order to reduce the number of expensive exact distance evaluations. The method is straightforward to implement using sparse projections which leads to a reduced memory footprint and fast index construction. Furthermore it enables grouping of the required computations into big matrix multiplications which leads to additional savings due to cache effects and low-level parallelization. We demonstrate by extensive experiments on a wide variety of data sets that the method is faster than existing partitioning tree or hashing based approaches making it the fastest available technique on high accuracy levels.</p>

To the best of our knowledge we are the first to give strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed binary hashing method by proving the efficiency of the mechanism for several classes of structured projection matrices. As a corollary we obtain binary hashing mechanisms with strong concentration results for circulant and Topelitz matrices. Our approach is however much more general.</p>

In these methods every data point is represented by a ranked list of pivots sorted by the distance to this point. Such ranked lists are called permutations. The underpinning assumption is that for both metric and non-metric spaces the distance between permutations is a good proxy for the distance between original points. Thus it should be possible to efficiently retrieve most true nearest neighbors by examining only a tiny subset of data points whose permutations are similar to the permutation of a query. We further test this assumption by carrying out an extensive experimental evaluation where permutation methods are pitted against state-of-the art benchmarks (the multi-probe LSH the VP-tree and proximity-graph based retrieval) on a variety of realistically large data set from the image and textual domain. The focus is on the high-accuracy retrieval methods for generic spaces. Additionally we assume that both data and indices are stored in main memory. We find permutation methods to be reasonably efficient and describe a setup where these methods are most useful. To ease reproducibility we make our software and data sets publicly available.</p>

Most of these deep hashing methods are supervised whose supervised information is given with triplet labels. For another common application scenario with pairwise labels there have not existed methods for simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning.

	<td><p>This paper addresses the problem of learning binary hash codes for large scale image search by proposing a novel hashing method based on deep neural network. The advantage of our deep model over previous deep model used in hashing is that our model contains necessary criteria for producing good codes such as similarity preserving balance and independence. Another advantage of our method is that instead of relaxing the binary constraint of codes during the learning process as most previous works in this paper by introducing the auxiliary variable we reformulate the optimization into two sub-optimization steps allowing us to efficiently solve binary constraints without any relaxation. The proposed method is also extended to the supervised hashing by leveraging the label information such that the learned binary codes preserve the pairwise label of inputs. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>The pervasiveness of massive data repositories has led
to much interest in efficient methods for indexing, search,
and retrieval. For image data, a rapidly developing body of
work for these applications shows impressive performance
with methods that broadly fall under the umbrella term of
Binary Hashing. Given a distance matrix, a binary hashing
algorithm solves for a binary code for the given set of examples, whose Hamming distance nicely approximates the
original distances. The formulation is non-convex â so existing solutions adopt spectral relaxations or perform coordinate descent (or quantization) on a surrogate objective
that is numerically more tractable. In this paper, we first
derive an Augmented Lagrangian approach to optimize the
standard binary Hashing objective (i.e., maintain fidelity
with a given distance matrix). With appropriate step sizes,
we find that this scheme already yields results that match or
substantially outperform state of the art methods on most
benchmarks used in the literature. Then, to allow the model
to scale to large datasets, we obtain an interesting reformulation of the binary hashing objective as a non-negative matrix factorization. Later, this leads to a simple multiplicative updates algorithm â whose parallelization properties
are exploited to obtain a fast GPU based implementation.
We give a probabilistic analysis of our initialization scheme
and present a range of experiments to show that the method
is simple to implement and competes favorably with available methods (both for optimization and generalization).</p>

Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.</p>

highly related to the kNN classification accuracy, this paper
proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method,
which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN
accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make
it scalable well to large problem, we propose a factorized
neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the
neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable,
we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn
accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and

This method achieved the best performance on CIFAR-10 and was comparable with the state-of-the-art on MNIST.

	<td><p>Extracting informative image features and learning effective approximate hashing functions are two crucial steps in image retrieval . Conventional methods often study these two steps separately e.g. learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency i.e. images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.</p>

Unfortunately many existing hashing methods based on observed keyword features are not effective for short texts due to the sparseness and shortness. Recently some researchers try to utilize latent topics of certain granularity to preserve semantic similarity in hash codes beyond keyword matching. However topics of certain granularity are not adequate to represent the intrinsic semantic information. In this paper we present a novel unified approach for short text Hashing using Multi-granularity Topics and Tags dubbed HMTT. In particular we propose a selection method to choose the optimal multi-granularity topics depending on the type of dataset and design two distinct hashing strategies to incorporate multi-granularity topics. We also propose a simple and effective method to exploit tags to enhance the similarity of related texts. We carry out extensive experiments on one short text dataset as well as on one normal text dataset.

	<td><p>A typical image retrieval pipeline starts with the comparison of global descriptors from a large database to find a short list of candidate matches. A good image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two contradictory requirements providing recall rates as high as possible and being as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image classification descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place of the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with better retrieval performances. Nevertheless the dimensionality of a typical DCNN descriptor âextracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the fully-connected layersâ remains quite high at several thousands of scalar values. In this paper we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH) a fully unsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes âin the 32-256 bits rangeâ from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two successive deep learning steps. First Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBM) a type of unsupervised deep neural nets are used to learn binary embedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired bitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the expense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN descriptor space. Then triplet networks a rank learning scheme based on weight sharing nets is used to fine-tune the binary embedding functions to retain as much as possible of the useful metric properties of the original space. A thorough empirical evaluation conducted on multiple publicly available dataset using DCNN descriptors shows that our method is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised schemes in the target bit range.</p>

We present a novel network architecture HashedNets that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training.

Different from most of the existing unsupervised approaches for yielding binary codes our method is based on a dimensionality-reduction criterion that its resulting mapping is designed to preserve the image relationships entailed by the inner products of sparse codes rather than those implied by the Euclidean distances in the ambient space. While the proposed formulation does not require computing any sparse codes the underlying computation model still inevitably involves solving an unmanageable eigenproblem when extremely high-dimensional descriptors are used.

	<td><p>Multimodal hashing is essential to cross-media
similarity search for its low storage cost and fast
query speed. Most existing multimodal hashing
methods embedded heterogeneous data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, and then
rounded the continuous embeddings to obtain the
binary codes. Yet they usually neglect the inherent discrete nature of hashing for relaxing the discrete constraints, which will cause degraded retrieval performance especially for long codes. For
this purpose, a novel Semantic Topic Multimodal
Hashing (STMH) is developed by considering latent semantic information in coding procedure.
It
first discovers clustering patterns of texts and robust factorizes the matrix of images to obtain multiple semantic topics of texts and concepts of images.
Then the learned multimodal semantic features are
transformed into a common subspace by their correlations. Finally, each bit of unified hash code
can be generated directly by figuring out whether a
topic or concept is contained in a text or an image.
Therefore, the obtained model by STMH is more
suitable for hashing scheme as it directly learns discrete hash codes in the coding process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Based on this assumption our approach dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH) constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design SSDH has a nice characteristic that classification and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover SSDH performs joint learning of image representations hash codes and classification in a point-wised manner and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy while the classification performance is not sacrificed.</p>

increasingly popular because of their high efficiency in handling large-scale computer vision applications. It has been
demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that
leverage supervised information can significantly enhance
the coding quality, and hence greatly benefit visual search
tasks. Typically, a modern binary coding method seeks
to learn a group of coding functions which compress data
samples into binary codes. However, few methods pursued
the coding functions such that the precision at the top of
a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized.
In this paper, we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach, namely
Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC), which
explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train
the disciplined coding functions, by which the mistakes at
the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized
more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions, we relax the original discrete optimization objective
with a continuous surrogate, and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost, we also design an online
learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more
efficiently. Empirical studies based upon three benchmark
image datasets demonstrate that the proposed binary coding approach achieves superior image search accuracy over
the state-of-the-arts.</p>

Unfortunately batch-learning strategies can be inefficient when confronted with large training datasets. Moreover with batch-learners it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as a dataset continues to grow and diversify over time. Yet in many practical scenarios the dataset grows and diversifies; thus both the hash functions and the indexing must swiftly accommodate these changes. To address these issues we propose an online hashing method that is amenable to changes and expansions of the datasets. Since it is an online algorithm our approach offers linear complexity with the dataset size. Our solution is supervised in that we incorporate available label information to preserve the semantic neighborhood. Such an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the hash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is high then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the system especially for large indexes. Thus we also propose a framework to reduce hash table updates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art solutions on two benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.</p>

	<td><p>We present NearBucket-LSH an effective algorithm for similarity search in large-scale distributed online social networks organized as peer-to-peer overlays. As communication is a dominant consideration in distributed systems we focus on minimizing the network cost while guaranteeing good search quality. Our algorithm is based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) which limits the search to collections of objects called buckets that have a high probability to be similar to the query. More specifically NearBucket-LSH employs an LSH extension that searches in near buckets and improves search quality but also significantly increases the network cost. We decrease the network cost by considering the internals of both LSH and the P2P overlay and harnessing their properties to our needs. We show that our NearBucket-LSH increases search quality for a given network cost compared to previous art. In many cases the search quality increases by more than 50.</p>

	<td><p>Efficient similarity retrieval from large-scale multimodal database is pervasive in modern search engines and social networks. To support queries across content modalities the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme that is they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.</p>

We propose a novel and efficient training algorithm inspired by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that overcomes some of these limitations. Our method decomposes the training process into independent layer-wise local updates through auxiliary variables. Empirically we observe that our training algorithm always converges and its computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the networks. Empirically we manage to train DNNs with 64 hidden layers and 1024 nodes per layer for supervised hashing in about 3 hours using a single GPU.

	<td><p>We develop 0-bit consistent weighted sampling (CWS) for efficiently estimating min-max kernel, which is a generalization of the resemblance kernel originally designed for binary data. Because the estimator of 0-bit CWS constitutes a positive definite kernel, this method can be naturally applied to large-scale data mining problems. Basically, if we feed the sampled data from 0-bit CWS to a highly efficient linear classifier (e.g., linear SVM), we effectively (and approximately) train a nonlinear classifier based on the min-max kernel. The accuracy improves as we increase the sample size.</p>

<p>In this paper, we first demonstrate, through an extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. This helps justify the use of min-max kernel. However, as the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data, we propose to linearize the min-max kernel via 0-bit CWS, a simplification of the original CWS method.</p>

<p>The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces samples in the form of (i<em>, t</em>) where the i* records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the t* is theoretically unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. We provide a simple solution by discarding t* (which we refer to as the â0-bitâ scheme). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information. We then apply 0-bit CWS for building linear classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated on a wide range of public datasets.</p>

<p>We expect this work will generate interests among data mining practitioners who would like to efficiently utilize the nonlinear information of non-binary and nonnegative data.</p>

Extensive centralized hashing algorithms have

functions by aggregating all the data into a fusion
center is infeasible because of the prohibitively
expensive communication and computation overhead.
In this paper, we develop a novel hashing
model to learn hash functions in a distributed setting. We cast a centralized hashing model as a
set of subproblems with consensus constraints.
We find these subproblems can be analytically
solved in parallel on the distributed compute nodes. Since no training data is transmitted across
the nodes in the learning process, the communication cost of our model is independent to the data size. Extensive experiments on several large

	<td><p>The objective of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) methods is essentially to extract from large (image) databases a specified number of images similar in visual and semantic content to a so-called query image. To bridge the semantic gap that exists between the representation of an image by low-level features (namely colour shape texture) and its high-level semantic content as perceived by humans CBIR systems typically make use of the relevance feedback (RF) mechanism. RF iteratively incorporates user-given inputs regarding the relevance of retrieved images to improve retrieval efficiency. One approach is to vary the weights of the features dynamically via feature reweighting. In this work an attempt has been made to improve retrieval accuracy by enhancing a CBIR system based on color features alone through implicit incorporation of shape information obtained through prior segmentation of the images. Novel schemes for feature reweighting as well as for initialization of the relevant set for improved relevance feedback have also been proposed for boosting performance of RF- based CBIR. At the same time new measures for evaluation of retrieval accuracy have been suggested to overcome the limitations of existing measures in the RF context. Results of extensive experiments have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</p>

We develop a joint optimization framework to learn projections which improve the accuracy of supervised hashing over the current state of the art with respect to standard and sibling evaluation metrics. We further boost performance by applying the supervised dimensionality reduction technique on kernelized input CNN features.

	<td><p>Randomized algorithms are often enjoyed for their simplicity but the hash functions employed to yield the desired probabilistic guarantees are often too complicated to be practical. Here we survey recent results on how simple hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees. Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist 1970. Keys are viewed as consisting of c characters and we have precomputed character tables h_1â¦h_c mapping characters to random hash values. A key x=(x_1â¦x_c) is hashed to h_1x_1 oplus h_2x_2â¦..oplus h_cx_c. This schemes is very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even 4-independent it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally obtained via higher independence e.g. linear probing and Cuckoo hashing. Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is twisted in a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional properties Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and data-structures. Finally we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation functions applying one to the output of the other and show that this yields very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman 1977. In fact w.h.p. for a given set of size proportional to that of the space consumed double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given time and space. While these tabulation schemes are all easy to implement and use their analysis is not.</p>

to seek multiple hierarchical non-linear transformations to
learn these binary codes, so that the nonlinear relationship
of samples can be well exploited. Our model is learned under
three constraints at the top layer of the deep network:
1) the loss between the original real-valued feature descriptor
and the learned binary vector is minimized, 2) the binary
codes distribute evenly on each bit, and 3) different bits
are as independent as possible. To further improve the discriminative
power of the learned binary codes, we extend
DH into supervised DH (SDH) by including one discriminative
term into the objective function of DH which simultaneously
maximizes the inter-class variations and minimizes
the intra-class variations of the learned binary codes. Experimental

	<td><p>We consider a new construction of locality-sensitive hash functions for Hamming space that is in the sense that is it guaranteed to produce a collision for every pair of vectors within a given radius r. The construction is in the sense that the expected number of hash collisions between vectors at distance~cr for a given c1 comes close to that of the best possible data independent LSH without the covering guarantee namely the seminal LSH construction of Indyk and Motwani (STOC 98). The efficiency of the new construction essentially their bound when the search radius is not too large â e.g. when cr = o(log(n)/loglog n) where n is the number of points in the data set and when cr = log(n)/k where k is an integer constant. In general it differs by at most a factor ln(4) in the exponent of the time bounds. As a consequence LSH-based similarity search in Hamming space can avoid the problem of false negatives at little or no cost in efficiency.</p>

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of hashing techniques in fast nearest neighbor search. In practice many
applications (e.g., visual search, object detection, image
matching, etc.) have enjoyed the benefits of complementary hash tables and information fusion over multiple views.
However, most of prior research mainly focused on compact hash code cleaning, and rare work studies how to build
multiple complementary hash tables, much less to adaptively integrate information stemming from multiple views.
In
this paper we first present a novel multi-view complementary hash table method that learns complementary hash tables from the data with multiple views. For single multiview table, using exemplar based feature fusion, we approximate the inherent data similarities with a low-rank matrix,
and learn discriminative hash functions in an efficient way.
To build complementary tables and meanwhile maintain scalable training and fast out-of-sample extension, an exemplar reweighting scheme is introduced to update the induced low-rank similarity in the sequential table construction framework, which indeed brings mutual benefits between tables by placing greater importance on exemplars
shared by mis-separated neighbors. Extensive experiments
on three large-scale image datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms various naive
solutions and state-of-the-art multi-table methods.</p>

We propose a sampling-based approach that avoids direct computation of all mn dot products. We select diamonds (i.e. four-cycles) from the weighted tripartite representation of A and B. The probability of selecting a diamond corresponding to pair (ij) is proportional to (a_i)^2 amplifying the focus on the largest-magnitude entries. Experimental results indicate that diamond sampling is orders of magnitude faster than direct computation and requires far fewer samples than any competing approach.

However for large datasets these distance computing methods perform excessive computations. We avoid excessive computations by storing the encodings on an Encoding Tree(E-Tree) interestingly the memory consumption is also lowered. We also propose Encoding Forest(E-Forest) to further lower the computation cost. E-Tree and E-Forest is compatible with various existing quantization-based methods.

	<td><p>Binary Hashing is widely used for effective approximate nearest neighbors search. Even though various binary hashing methods have been proposed very few methods are feasible for extremely high-dimensional features often used in visual tasks today. We propose a novel highly sparse linear hashing method based on pairwise rotations. The encoding cost of the proposed algorithm is (n log n) for n-dimensional features whereas that of the existing state-of-the-art method is typically (n^2). The proposed method is also remarkably faster in the learning phase. Along with the efficiency the retrieval accuracy is comparable to or slightly outperforming the state-of-the-art. Pairwise rotations used in our method are formulated from an analytical study of the trade-off relationship between quantization error and entropy of binary codes. Although these hashing criteria are widely used in previous researches its analytical behavior is rarely studied. All building blocks of our algorithm are based on the analytical solution and it thus provides a fairly simple and efficient procedure.</p>

In this paper we compare these to another extremely simple approach for solving approximate MIPS based on variants of the k-means clustering algorithm. Specifically we propose to train a spherical k-means after having reduced the MIPS problem to a Maximum Cosine Similarity Search (MCSS). Experiments on two standard recommendation system benchmarks as well as on large vocabulary word embeddings show that this simple approach yields much higher speedups for the same retrieval precision than current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods.

Most of the hand-crafted features just encode the low-level information of the input the feature may not preserve the semantic similarities of images pairs. Meanwhile the hashing function learning process is independent with the feature representation so the feature may not be optimal for the hashing projection. In this paper we propose a supervised hashing method based on a well designed deep convolutional neural network which tries to learn hashing code and compact representations of data simultaneously.

Human action recognition as one of the key components in these devices plays an important role to guarantee the quality of user experience. Although the model-driven methods have achieved huge success they cannot provide a scalable solution for efficiently storing retrieving and recognizing actions in the large-scale applications. These models are also vulnerable to the temporal translation and warping as well as the variations in motion scales and execution rates. To address these challenges we propose to treat the 3D human action recognition as a video-level hashing problem and propose a novel First-Take-All (FTA) Hashing algorithm capable of hashing the entire video into hash codes of fixed length. We demonstrate that this FTA algorithm produces a compact representation of the video invariant to the above mentioned variations through which action recognition can be solved by an efficient nearest neighbor search by the Hamming distance between the FTA hash codes. Experiments on the public 3D human action datasets shows that the FTA algorithm can reach a recognition accuracy higher than 80 with about 15 bits per frame considering there are 65 frames per video over the datasets.</p>

In particular our lower bound matches the bound of rhole 2c-1+o(1) for the ell_1 space obtained via the recent algorithm from Andoni-Razenshteyn STOC15. In recent years it emerged that data-dependent hashing is strictly superior to the classical Locality-Sensitive Hashing when the hash function is data-independent. In the latter setting the best exponent has been already known for the ell_1 space the tight bound is rho=1/c with the upper bound from Indyk-Motwani STOC98 and the matching lower bound from ODonnell-Wu-Zhou ITCS11. We prove that even if the hashing is data-dependent it must hold that rhoge 2c-1-o(1). To prove the result we need to formalize the exact notion of data-dependent hashing that also captures the complexity of the hash functions (in addition to their collision properties). Without restricting such complexity we would allow for obviously infeasible solutions such as the Voronoi diagram of a dataset. To preclude such solutions we require our hash functions to be succinct. This condition is satisfied by all the known algorithmic results.</p>

	<td><p>Manga (Japanese comics) are popular worldwide. However current e-manga archives offer very limited search support including keyword-based search by title or author or tag-based categorization. To make the manga search experience more intuitive efficient and enjoyable we propose a content-based manga retrieval system. First we propose a manga-specific image-describing framework. It consists of efficient margin labeling edge orientation histogram feature description and approximate nearest-neighbor search using product quantization. Second we propose a sketch-based interface as a natural way to interact with manga content. The interface provides sketch-based querying relevance feedback and query retouch. For evaluation we built a novel dataset of manga images Manga109 which consists of 109 comic books of 21142 pages drawn by professional manga artists. To the best of our knowledge Manga109 is currently the biggest dataset of manga images available for research. We conducted a comparative study a localization evaluation and a large-scale qualitative study. From the experiments we verified that (1) the retrieval accuracy of the proposed method is higher than those of previous methods; (2) the proposed method can localize an object instance with reasonable runtime and accuracy; and (3) sketch querying is useful for manga search.</p>

The DBC texture descriptor captures the spatial relationship between any pair of neighbourhood pixels in a local region along a given direction while Local Binary Patterns descriptor considers the relationship between a given pixel and its surrounding neighbours. Therefore DBC captures more spatial information than LBP and its variants also it can extract more edge information than LBP. Hence we employ DBC technique in order to extract grey level texture feature from each RGB channels individually and computed texture maps are further combined which represents colour texture features of an image. Then we decomposed the extracted colour texture map and original image using Haar wavelet transform. Finally we encode the shape and local features of wavelet transformed images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients for content based image retrieval. The performance of proposed method is compared with existing methods on two databases such as Wangs corel image and Caltech 256. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms the existing methods for image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Recently very high-dimensional feature representations e.g. Fisher Vector have achieved excellent performance for visual recognition and retrieval. However these lengthy representations always cause extremely heavy computational and storage costs and even become unfeasible in some large-scale applications. A few existing techniques can transfer very high-dimensional data into binary codes but they still require the reduced code length to be relatively long to maintain acceptable accuracies. To target a better balance between computational efficiency and accuracies in this paper we propose a novel embedding method called Binary Projection Bank (BPB) which can effectively reduce the very high-dimensional representations to medium-dimensional binary codes without sacrificing accuracies. Instead of using conventional single linear or bilinear projections the proposed method learns a bank of small projections via the max-margin constraint to optimally preserve the intrinsic data similarity. We have systematically evaluated the proposed method on three datasets Flickr 1M ILSVR2010 and UCF101 showing competitive retrieval and recognition accuracies compared with state-of-the-art approaches but with a significantly smaller memory footprint and lower coding complexity.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a widely-used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. For most existing hashing methods an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. However such visual feature vectors may not be optimally compatible with the coding process thus producing sub-optimal hashing codes. In this paper we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing in which images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image datasets show that the proposed simultaneous feature learning and hash coding pipeline brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art supervised or unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

Overall the proposed algorithm corresponds to locality sensitive hashing in the space of directions with hashing based on the order of components. Thanks to the statistical features emerging through ordering it deals very well with the challenging case of unstructured data and is a valuable building block for more complex techniques dealing with structured data.

exploiting the similarity to guide the hashing

Binary descriptors have drawn increasing interest in recent years due to their speed and low memory footprint. A known shortcoming of these representations is their inferior performance compared to larger histogram based descriptors such as the SIFT. Our goal is to close this performance gap while maintaining the benefits attributed to binary representations. To this end we propose the Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes descriptors or LATCH. Our key observation is that existing binary descriptors are at an increased risk from noise and local appearance variations. This as they compare the values of pixel pairs; changes to either of the pixels can easily lead to changes in descriptor values hence damaging its performance. In order to provide more robustness we instead propose a novel means of comparing pixel patches. This ostensibly small change requires a substantial redesign of the descriptors themselves and how they are produced. Our resulting LATCH representation is rigorously compared to state-of-the-art binary descriptors and shown to provide far better performance for similar computation and space requirements.</p>

	<td><p>In supervised binary hashing one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem nonconvex and nonsmooth because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training solving a continuous optimization and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results but the hash function was still learned a posteriori which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as a corrected iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.</p>

The library images need not to be associated with spatial information regarding the viewpoint and orientation of the scene. As a result these images are cheaper than the database images; in addition they are readily available. Our proposed descriptor directly mines the image library to discover landmarks (i.e. image patches) that suitably match an input query/database image. The discovered landmarks are then compactly described by their pose and shape (i.e. library image ID bounding boxes) and used as a compact discriminative scene descriptor for the input image. We evaluate the effectiveness of our scene description framework by comparing its performance to that of previous approaches.</p>

	<td><p>We study the problem of similarity learning and its application to image retrieval with large-scale data. The similarity between pairs of images can be measured by the distances between their high dimensional representations and the problem of learning the appropriate similarity is often addressed by distance metric learning. However distance metric learning requires the learned metric to be a PSD matrix which is computational expensive and not necessary for retrieval ranking problem. On the other hand the bilinear model is shown to be more flexible for large-scale image retrieval task hence we adopt it to learn a matrix for estimating pairwise similarities under the regression framework. By adaptively updating the target matrix in regression we can mimic the hinge loss which is more appropriate for similarity learning problem. Although the regression problem can have the closed-form solution the computational cost can be very expensive. The computational challenges come from two aspects the number of images can be very large and image features have high dimensionality. We address the first challenge by compressing the data by a randomized algorithm with the theoretical guarantee. For the high dimensional issue we address it by taking low rank assumption and applying alternating method to obtain the partial matrix which has a global optimal solution. Empirical studies on real world image datasets (i.e. Caltech and ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

In this paper we investigate binary speaker embedding which transforms i-vectors to binary vectors (codes) by a hash function. We start from locality sensitive hashing (LSH) a simple binarization approach where binary codes are derived from a set of random hash functions. A potential problem of LSH is that the randomly sampled hash functions might be suboptimal. We therefore propose an improved Hamming distance learning approach where the hash function is learned by a variable-sized block training that projects each dimension of the original i-vectors to variable-sized binary codes independently. Our experiments show that binary speaker embedding can deliver competitive or even better results on both speaker verification and identification tasks while the memory usage and the computation cost are significantly reduced.</p>

	<td><p>The convolutional neural network (CNN) features can give a good description of image content which usually represent images with unique global vectors. Although they are compact compared to local descriptors they still cannot efficiently deal with large-scale image retrieval due to the cost of the linear incremental computation and storage. To address this issue we build a simple but effective indexing framework based on inverted table which significantly decreases both the search time and memory usage. In addition several strategies are fully investigated under an indexing framework to adapt it to CNN features and compensate for quantization errors. First we use multiple assignment for the query and database images to increase the probability of relevant images co-existing in the same Voronoi cells obtained via the clustering algorithm. Then we introduce embedding codes to further improve precision by removing false matches during a search. We demonstrate that by using hashing schemes to calculate the embedding codes and by changing the ranking rule indexing framework speeds can be greatly improved. Extensive experiments conducted on several unsupervised and supervised benchmarks support these results and the superiority of the proposed indexing framework. We also provide a fair comparison between the popular CNN features.</p>

However most of the existing methods address only one or two of the above mentioned requirements. In this work we present a method based on randomized locality sensitive hashing which tries to address all of the above requirements simultaneously. While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency we argue that one can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs between accuracy and diversity. We extend our method to the problem of multi-label prediction where the goal is to output a diverse and accurate set of labels for a given document in real-time. Moreover we introduce a new notion to simultaneously evaluate a methods performance for both the precision and diversity measures. Finally we present empirical results on several different retrieval tasks and show that our method retrieves diverse and accurate images/labels while ensuring 100x-speed-up over the existing diverse retrieval approaches.</p>

However it also incurs challenges arising from the fact that linear subspaces do not obey Euclidean geometry but lie on a special type of Riemannian manifolds known as Grassmannian. To leverage the techniques developed for Euclidean spaces (e.g support vector machines) with subspaces several recent studies have proposed to embed the Grassmannian into a Hilbert space by making use of a positive definite kernel. Unfortunately only two Grassmannian kernels are known none of which -as we will show- is universal which limits their ability to approximate a target function arbitrarily well. Here we introduce several positive definite Grassmannian kernels including universal ones and demonstrate their superiority over previously-known kernels in various tasks such as classification clustering sparse coding and hashing.</p>

The prior work compared the two schemes in the context of similarity estimation and training linear classifiers with the conclusion that the step of random offset is not necessary and may hurt the performance (depending on the similarity level). The task of near neighbor search is related to similarity estimation with importance distinctions and requires own study. In this paper we demonstrate that in the context of near neighbor search the step of random offset is not needed either and may hurt the performance (sometimes significantly so depending on the similarity and other parameters).</p>

It is combined with an efficient monomial embedding to provide a codebook-free method to aggregate local descriptors into a single vector representation. Our strategy is also compatible and employed with several popular encoding methods in particular bag-of-words VLAD and the Fisher vector.

This architecture is composed of several memory units each of which summarizes a fraction of the database by a single representative vector. The potential similarity of the query to one of the vectors stored in the memory unit is gauged by a simple correlation with the memory units representative vector. This representative optimizes the test of the following hypothesis the query is independent from any vector in the memory unit vs. the query is a simple perturbation of one of the stored vectors. Compared to exhaustive search our approach finds the most similar database vectors significantly faster without a noticeable reduction in search quality.

We introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme with information-theoretic code aggregation showing for the first time how random forest a technique that together with deep learning have shown spectacular results in classification can also be extended to large-scale retrieval. Traditional random forest fails to enforce the consistency of hashes generated from each tree for the same class data i.e. to preserve the underlying similarity and it also lacks a principled way for code aggregation across trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme where independently trained random trees in a forest are acting as hashing functions. We the propose a subspace model as the splitting function and show that it enforces the hash consistency in a tree for data from the same class. We also introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. Experiments on large-scale public datasets are presented showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for retrieval tasks.</p>

	<td><p>The similarity searches that use high-dimensional feature vectors consisting of a vast amount of data have a wide range of application. One way of conducting a fast similarity search is to transform the feature vectors into binary vectors and perform the similarity search by using the Hamming distance. Such a transformation is a hashing method and the choice of hashing function is important. Hashing methods using hyperplanes or hyperspheres are proposed. One study reported here is inspired by Spherical LSH and we use hypersperes to hash the feature vectors. Our method called Eclipse-hashing performs a compactification of R^n by using the inverse stereographic projection which is a kind of Alexandrov compactification. By using Eclipse-hashing one can obtain the hypersphere-hash function without explicitly using hyperspheres. Hence the number of nonlinear operations is reduced and the processing time of hashing becomes shorter. Furthermore we also show that as a result of improving the approximation accuracy Eclipse-hashing is more accurate than hyperplane-hashing.</p>

It then retrieves images with a specialized online learning algorithm that balances the tradeoff between exploring new images and exploiting the already inferred interests of the user.

	<td><p>Binary codes have been widely used in vision problems as a compact feature representation to achieve both space and time advantages. Various methods have been proposed to learn data-dependent hash functions which map a feature vector to a binary code. However considerable data information is inevitably lost during the binarization step which also causes ambiguity in measuring sample similarity using Hamming distance. Besides the learned hash functions cannot be changed after training which makes them incapable of adapting to new data outside the training data set. To address both issues in this paper we propose a flexible bitwise weight learning framework based on the binary codes obtained by state-of-the-art hashing methods and incorporate the learned weights into the weighted Hamming distance computation. We then formulate the proposed framework as a ranking problem and leverage the Ranking SVM model to offline tackle the weight learning. The framework is further extended to an online mode which updates the weights at each time new data comes thereby making it scalable to large and dynamic data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains of using binary codes with bitwise weighting in image retrieval tasks. It is appealing that the online weight learning leads to comparable accuracy with its offline counterpart which thus makes our approach practical for realistic applications.</p>

	<td><p>To increase the computational efficiency of interest-point based object retrieval researchers have put remarkable research efforts into improving the efficiency of kNN-based feature matching pursuing to match thousands of features against a database within fractions of a second. However due to the high-dimensional nature of image features that reduces the effectivity of index structures (curse of dimensionality) due to the vast amount of features stored in image databases (images are often represented by up to several thousand features) this ultimate goal demanded to trade query runtimes for query precision. In this paper we address an approach complementary to indexing in order to improve the runtimes of retrieval by querying only the most promising keypoint descriptors as this affects matching runtimes linearly and can therefore lead to increased efficiency. As this reduction of kNN queries reduces the number of tentative correspondences a loss of query precision is minimized by an additional image-level correspondence generation stage with a computational performance independent of the underlying indexing structure. We evaluate such an adaption of the standard recognition pipeline on a variety of datasets using both SIFT and state-of-the-art binary descriptors. Our results suggest that decreasing the number of queried descriptors does not necessarily imply a reduction in the result quality as long as alternative ways of increasing query recall (by thoroughly selecting k) and MAP (using image-level correspondence generation) are considered.</p>

	<td><p>Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving the Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques in contrast are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high-dimensional data. The complexities of these models and the problems with out-of-sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding however. In this work how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties an efficient inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of t-SNE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved for example by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal rotations. In addition a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is developed by incorporating the label information which is shown to greatly advance the semantic retrieval performance.</p>

We also evaluate the improvement in the retrieval performance of neural codes when the network is retrained on a dataset of images that are similar to images encountered at test time. We further evaluate the performance of the compressed neural codes and show that a simple PCA compression provides very good short codes that give state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of datasets. In general neural codes turn out to be much more resilient to such compression in comparison other state-of-the-art descriptors. Finally we show that discriminative dimensionality reduction trained on a dataset of pairs of matched photographs improves the performance of PCA-compressed neural codes even further.

	<td><p>Classifying large-scale image data into object categories is an important problem that has received increasing research attention. Given the huge amount of data non-parametric approaches such as nearest neighbor classifiers have shown promising results especially when they are underpinned by a learned distance or similarity measurement. Although metric learning has been well studied in the past decades most existing algorithms are impractical to handle large-scale data sets. In this paper we present an image similarity learning method that can scale well in both the number of images and the dimensionality of image descriptors. To this end similarity comparison is restricted to each samples local neighbors and a discriminative similarity measure is induced from large margin neighborhood embedding. We also exploit the ensemble of projections so that high-dimensional features can be processed in a set of lower-dimensional subspaces in parallel without much performance compromise. The similarity function is learned online using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which the triplet sampling strategy is customized for quick convergence of classification performance. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated on several data sets with scales varying from tens of thousands to one million images. Recognition accuracies competitive with the state-of-the-art performance are achieved with much higher efficiency and scalability.</p>

A simplification of FV is attractive so we propose Sparse Fisher vector (SFV). By incorporating locality strategy we can accelerate the Fisher coding step in image categorization which is implemented from a collective of local descriptors. Combining with pooling step we explore the relationship between coding step and pooling step to give a theoretical explanation about SFV. Experiments on benchmark datasets have shown that SFV leads to a speedup of several-fold of magnitude compares with FV while maintaining the categorization performance.

	<td><p>Hashing has emerged as a popular technique for fast nearest neighbor search in gigantic
databases. In particular, learning based hashing has received considerable
attention due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. However, the performance
of most unsupervised learning based hashing methods deteriorates rapidly
as the hash code length increases. We argue that the degraded performance is due
to inferior optimization procedures used to achieve discrete binary codes. This
paper presents a graph-based unsupervised hashing model to preserve the neighborhood
structure of massive data in a discrete code space. We cast the graph
hashing problem into a discrete optimization framework which directly learns the
binary codes. A tractable alternating maximization algorithm is then proposed to
explicitly deal with the discrete constraints, yielding high-quality codes to well
capture the local neighborhoods. Extensive experiments performed on four large
datasets with up to one million samples show that our discrete optimization based
graph hashing method obtains superior search accuracy over state-of-the-art unsupervised
hashing methods, especially for longer codes.</p>

	<td><p>The query complexity of locality sensitive hashing
(LSH) based similarity search is dominated
by the number of hash evaluations, and this number
grows with the data size (Indyk &amp; Motwani,
1998). In industrial applications such as search
where the data are often high-dimensional and
binary (e.g., text n-grams), minwise hashing is
widely adopted, which requires applying a large
number of permutations on the data. This is
costly in computation and energy-consumption.
In this paper, we propose a hashing technique
which generates all the necessary hash evaluations
needed for similarity search, using one
single permutation. The heart of the proposed
hash function is a ârotationâ scheme which densifies
the sparse sketches of one permutation
hashing (Li et al., 2012) in an unbiased fashion
thereby maintaining the LSH property. This
makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table
construction. This idea of rotation presented
in this paper could be of independent interest for
densifying other types of sparse sketches.
Using our proposed hashing method, the query
time of a (K, L)-parameterized LSH is reduced
from the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely
O(KL + dL), where d is the number of nonzeros
of the data vector, K is the number of hashes
in each hash table, and L is the number of hash
tables. Our experimental evaluation on real data
confirms that the proposed scheme significantly
reduces the query processing time over minwise
hashing without loss in retrieval accuracies.</p>

This generic method was originally introduced by Flajolet and Martin~FOCS83 in order to save a factor Omega(k) of time per element over k independent samples when estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream. It was also used in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet et al.~AOFA97 and in large-scale machine learning by Li et al.~NIPS12 for minwise estimation of set similarity. The main issue of k-partition is that the contents of different bins may be highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods of analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we show that a tabulation based hash function mixed tabulation does yield strong concentration bounds on the most popular applications of k-partitioning similar to those we would get using a truly random hash function. The analysis is very involved and implies several new results of independent interest for both simple and double tabulation e.g. a simple and efficient construction for invertible bloom filters and uniform hashing on a given set.</p>

	<td><p>This paper proposes a novel approach for storing and retrieving massive DNA sequences.. The method is based on a perceptual hash function commonly used to determine the similarity between digital images that we adapted for DNA sequences. Perceptual hash function presented here is based on a Discrete Cosine Transform Sign Only (DCT-SO). Each nucleotide is encoded as a fixed gray level intensity pixel and the hash is calculated from its significant frequency characteristics. This results to a drastic data reduction between the sequence and the perceptual hash. Unlike cryptographic hash functions perceptual hashes are not affected by avalanche effect and thus can be compared. The similarity distance between two hashes is estimated with the Hamming Distance which is used to retrieve DNA sequences. Experiments that we conducted show that our approach is relevant for storing massive DNA sequences and retrieving them.</p>

	<td><p>Minhashing is a technique used to estimate the Jaccard Index between two sets by exploiting the probability of collision in a random permutation. In order to speed up the computation a random permutation can be approximated by using an universal hash function such as the h_ab function proposed by Carter and Wegman. A better estimate of the Jaccard Index can be achieved by using many of these hash functions created at random. In this paper a new iterative procedure to generate a set of h_ab functions is devised that eliminates the need for a list of random values and avoid the multiplication operation during the calculation. The properties of the generated hash functions remains that of an universal hash function family. This is possible due to the random nature of features occurrence on sparse datasets. Results show that the uniformity of hashing the features is maintaned while obtaining a speed up of up to 1.38 compared to the traditional approach.</p>

address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary
Embedding (CBE) which generates binary
codes by projecting the data with a circulant matrix.
The circulant structure enables the use of
Fast Fourier Transformation to speed up the computation.
Compared to methods that use unstructured

the time complexity from O(d^2

and the space complexity from O(d^2) to O(d)
where d is the input dimensionality. We also
propose a novel time-frequency alternating optimization
to learn data-dependent circulant projections,
which alternatively minimizes the objective
in original and Fourier domains. We show
by extensive experiments that the proposed approach
gives much better performance than the
state-of-the-art approaches for fixed time, and
provides much faster computation with no performance

The large dimension of these features is a limiting factor upon the number of data points which may be effectively stored and processed however. We address this problem by developing a novel approach to learning a compact binary encoding which exploits both pair-wise proximity and class-label information on training data set. Exploiting this extra information allows the development of encodings which although compact outperform the original high-dimensional features in terms of final classification or retrieval performance. The method is general in that it is applicable to both non-parametric and parametric learning methods. This generality means that the embedded features are suitable for a wide variety of computer vision tasks such as image classification and content-based image retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that the new compact descriptor achieves an accuracy comparable to and in some cases better than the visual descriptor in the original space despite being significantly more compact. Moreover any convex loss function and convex regularization penalty (e.g. ell_p norm with p ge 1 ) can be incorporated into the framework which provides future flexibility.</p>

	<td><p>Embedding image features into a binary Hamming space can improve both the speed and accuracy of large-scale query-by-example image retrieval systems. Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact binary codes in a manner which preserves the label-based similarities of the original data. Most existing approaches apply a single form of hash function and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of those methods and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. In this work we proffer a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. The proposed framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context and simplifies the development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes the into two steps binary code (hash bits) learning and hash function learning. The first step can typically be formulated as a binary quadratic problem and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary classifiers. For solving large-scale binary code inference we show how to ensure that the binary quadratic problems are submodular such that an efficient graph cut approach can be used. To achieve efficiency as well as efficacy on large-scale high-dimensional data we propose to use boosted decision trees as the hash functions which are nonlinear highly descriptive and very fast to train and evaluate. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods especially on high-dimensional data.</p>

search approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Supervised hashing, which incorporates similarity/dissimilarity
information on entity pairs to improve
the quality of hashing function learning, has recently
received increasing attention. However, in the existing
supervised hashing methods for images, an input
image is usually encoded by a vector of hand-crafted
visual features. Such hand-crafted feature vectors
do not necessarily preserve the accurate semantic
similarities of images pairs, which may often degrade
the performance of hashing function learning. In this
paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for
image retrieval, in which we automatically learn a good
image representation tailored to hashing as well as a
set of hash functions. The proposed method has two
stages. In the first stage, given the pairwise similarity
matrix S over training images, we propose a scalable
coordinate descent method to decompose S into a
product of HHT where H is a matrix with each of its
rows being the approximate hash code associated to
a training image. In the second stage, we propose to
simultaneously learn a good feature representation for
the input images as well as a set of hash functions, via
a deep convolutional network tailored to the learned
hash codes in H and optionally the discrete class labels
of the images. Extensive empirical evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with different kinds of images
show that the proposed method has superior performance
gains over several state-of-the-art supervised

	<td><p>Minwise hashing (Minhash) is a widely popular indexing scheme in practice. Minhash is designed for estimating set resemblance and is known to be suboptimal in many applications where the desired measure is set overlap (i.e. inner product between binary vectors) or set containment. Minhash has inherent bias towards smaller sets which adversely affects its performance in applications where such a penalization is not desirable. In this paper we propose asymmetric minwise hashing (MH-ALSH) to provide a solution to this problem. The new scheme utilizes asymmetric transformations to cancel the bias of traditional minhash towards smaller sets making the final collision probability monotonic in the inner product. Our theoretical comparisons show that for the task of retrieving with binary inner products asymmetric minhash is provably better than traditional minhash and other recently proposed hashing algorithms for general inner products. Thus we obtain an algorithmic improvement over existing approaches in the literature. Experimental evaluations on four publicly available high-dimensional datasets validate our claims and the proposed scheme outperforms often significantly other hashing algorithms on the task of near neighbor retrieval with set containment. Our proposal is simple and easy to implement in practice.</p>

	<td><p>We propose two suffix array inspired full-text indexes. One called SA-hash augments the suffix array with a hash table to speed up pattern searches due to significantly narrowed search interval before the binary search phase. The other called FBCSA is a compact data structure similar to Makinens compact suffix array but working on fixed sized blocks. Experiments on the Pizza~~Chili 200MB datasets show that SA-hash is about 2â3 times faster in pattern searches (counts) than the standard suffix array for the price of requiring 0.2n-1.1n bytes of extra space where n is the text length and setting a minimum pattern length. FBCSA is relatively fast in single cell accesses (a few times faster than related indexes at about the same or better compression) but not competitive if many consecutive cells are to be extracted. Still for the task of extracting e.g. 10 successive cells its time-space relation remains attractive.</p>

	<td><p>Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact binary codes that are able to preserve label based similarity in the Hamming space. Non-linear hash functions have demonstrated the advantage over linear ones due to their powerful generalization capability. In the literature kernel functions are typically used to achieve non-linearity in hashing which achieve encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training time. Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving non-linearity in hashing which are fast to train and evaluate hence more suitable for hashing with high dimensional data. In our approach we first propose sub-modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem and an efficient GraphCut based block search method for solving large-scale inference. Then we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the binary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in retrieval precision and training time. Especially for high-dimensional data our method is orders of magnitude faster than many methods in terms of training time.</p>

In this article we concentrate on improving the performance of existing image classification algorithms by adding color information. To achieve this purpose different kinds of colored SIFT descriptors are introduced and implemented. Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) a state-of-the-art sparse coding technology is employed to construct the image classification system for the evaluation.

The complexity of these models and the problems with out-of-sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding however. In this work we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties we describe an efficient inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available.

	<td><p>Binary hashing has been widely used for efficient similarity search due to its query and storage efficiency. In most
existing binary hashing methods, the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or
similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming
distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient, however, in practice, there are
often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to
a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and
poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is
important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming
distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary
codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level
weights to different hash bits, the returned binary codes
are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give
an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive
weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale
image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted
Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p>

One of the plights of existing hashing techniques is the intrinsic trade-off between performance and computational complexity while longer hash codes allow for lower false positive rates it is very difficult to increase the embedding dimensionality without incurring in very high false negatives rates or prohibiting computational costs. In this paper we propose a way to overcome this limitation by enforcing the hash codes to be sparse. Sparse high-dimensional codes enjoy from the low false positive rates typical of long hashes while keeping the false negative rates similar to those of a shorter dense hashing scheme with equal number of degrees of freedom. We use a tailored feed-forward neural network for the hashing function. Extensive experimental evaluation involving visual and multi-modal data shows the benefits of the proposed method.</p>

Similarity searches can therefore be performed faster in Hamming distance space. The elements of Hamming distance space are bit strings. On the other hand the arrangement of hyperplanes induce the transformation from the feature vectors into feature bit strings. This transformation method is a type of locality-sensitive hashing that has been attracting attention as a way of performing approximate similarity searches at high speed. Supervised learning of hyperplane arrangements allows us to obtain a method that transforms them into feature bit strings reflecting the information of labels applied to higher-dimensional feature vectors. In this p aper we propose a supervised learning method for hyperplane arrangements in feature space that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We consider the probability density functions used during learning and evaluate their performance. We also consider the sampling method for learning data pairs needed in learning and we evaluate its performance. We confirm that the accuracy of this learning method when using a suitable probability density function and sampling method is greater than the accuracy of existing learning methods.</p>

	<td><p>Most existing approaches to hashing apply a single form of hash function, and an optimization process which
is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of the method to
respond to the data, and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here we propose
a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions.
This framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context, and simplifies the
development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes hashing learning problem
into two steps: hash bit learning and hash function learning based on the learned bits. The first step can typically
be formulated as binary quadratic problems, and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary
classifiers. Both problems have been extensively studied in the literature. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed framework is effective, flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p>

An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing searching and retrieving images from a large image database. Content Based Image Retrieval is a technique which uses visual features of image such as color shape texture to search user required image from large image database according to user requests in the form of a query.

Further our solution is simpler and easier to implement and can also be more space efficient in practice since we only use the inverse suffix array and longest common prefix array of the string while the algorithm in 6 uses the suffix tree of the string and other auxiliary data structures.

	<td><p>We consider bottom-k sampling for a set X picking a sample S_k(X) consisting of the k elements that are smallest according to a given hash function h. With this sample we can estimate the relative size f=Y/X of any subset Y as S_k(X) intersect Y/k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard similarity f=A intersect B/A union B between sets A and B. Given the bottom-k samples from A and B we construct the bottom-k sample of their union as S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)) and then the similarity is estimated as S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)/k. We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent the expected relative error is O(1/sqrt(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a constant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing. For comparison consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k hash independent functions h_1â¦h_k storing the smallest element with each hash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant independence and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently Feigenblat et al. showed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent and k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our result is based on a simply union bound transferring generic concentration bounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample e.g. getting stronger probability error bounds with higher independence. For weighted sets we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to the concrete input weights e.g. benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input. This time the analysis is much more involved but again we show that generic concentration bounds can be applied.</p>

cross-modal hashing approach with a linear time complexity to the training data size, to enable scalable indexing for multimedia 
search across multiple modals. Taking both the intra-similarity in each modal and the inter-similarity across different modals 
into consideration, the proposed approach aims at effectively learning hash functions from large-scale training datasets. 
More specifically, for each modal, we first partition the training data into $k$ clusters and then represent each training data 
point with its distances to $k$ centroids of the clusters. Interestingly, such a k-dimensional data representation can reduce 
the time complexity of the training phase from traditional O(n2) or higher to O(n), where $n$ is the training data size, leading to 
practical learning on large-scale datasets. We further prove that this new representation preserves the intra-similarity in each modal. 
To preserve the inter-similarity among data points across different modals, we transform the derived data representations into a 
common binary subspace in which binary codes from all the modals are âconsistentâ and comparable. The transformation simultaneously 
outputs the hash functions for all modals, which are used to convert unseen data into binary codes. Given a query of one modal, 
it is first mapped into the binary codes using the modalâs hash functions, followed by matching the database binary codes of any other 
modals. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets confirm the scalability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in 
comparison with the state of the art.</p>

Recently a number of approaches to learning data-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work we propose a column generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Algorithms to rapidly search massive image or video collections are critical for many vision applications, including visual search, content-based retrieval, and non-parametric models for object recognition. Recent work shows that learned binary projections are a powerful way to index large collections according to their content. The basic idea is to formulate the projections so as to approximately preserve a given similarity function of interest. Having done so, one can then search the data efficiently using hash tables, or by exploring the Hamming ball volume around a novel query. Both enable sub-linear time retrieval with respect to the database size. Further, depending on the design of the projections, in some cases it is possible to bound the number of database examples that must be searched in order to achieve a given level of accuracy.</p>

<p>This chapter overviews data structures for fast search with binary codes, and then describes several supervised and unsupervised strategies for generating the codes. In particular, we review supervised methods that integrate metric learning, boosting, and neural networks into the hash key construction, and unsupervised methods based on spectral analysis or kernelized random projections that compute affinity-preserving binary codes.Whether learning from explicit semantic supervision or exploiting the structure among unlabeled data, these methods make scalable retrieval possible for a variety of robust visual similarity measures.We focus on defining the algorithms, and illustrate the main points with results using millions of images.</p>

In this problem we have as input a dictionary D of d strings of total length n over an alphabet of size sigma. Given a bound k and a pattern x of length m a query has to return all the strings of the dictionary which are at edit distance at most k from x where the edit distance between two strings x and y is defined as the minimum-cost sequence of edit operations that transform x into y. The cost of a sequence of operations is defined as the sum of the costs of the operations involved in the sequence. In this paper we assume that each of these operations has unit cost and consider only three operations deletion of one character insertion of one character and substitution of a character by another. We present a practical implementation of the data structure we recently proposed and which works only for one error. We extend the scheme to 2leq k&lt;m. Our implementation has many desirable properties it has a very fast and space-efficient building algorithm. The dictionary data structure is compact and has fast and robust query time. Finally our data structure is simple to implement as it only uses basic techniques from the literature mainly hashing (linear probing and hash signatures) and succinct data structures (bitvectors supporting rank queries).</p>

	<td><p>Hashing-based fast nearest neighbor search technique
has attracted great attention in both research
and industry areas recently. Many existing hashing
approaches encode data with projection-based hash
functions and represent each projected dimension
by 1-bit. However, the dimensions with high variance
hold large energy or information of data but
treated equivalently as dimensions with low variance,
which leads to a serious information loss. In
this paper, we introduce a novel hashing algorithm
called Harmonious Hashing which aims at learning
hash functions with low information loss. Specifically,
we learn a set of optimized projections to
preserve the maximum cumulative energy and meet
the constraint of equivalent variance on each dimension
as much as possible. In this way, we could
minimize the information loss after binarization.
Despite the extreme simplicity, our method outperforms
superiorly to many state-of-the-art hashing
methods in large-scale and high-dimensional nearest
neighbor search experiments.</p>

The kernel k-means algorithm is however computationally very complex as it requires the complete data matrix to be calculated and stored. Further the kernelized nature of the kernel k-means algorithm hinders the parallelization of its computations on modern infrastructures for distributed computing. In this paper we are defining a family of kernel-based low-dimensional embeddings that allows for scaling kernel k-means on MapReduce via an efficient and unified parallelization strategy. Afterwards we propose two methods for low-dimensional embedding that adhere to our definition of the embedding family. Exploiting the proposed parallelization strategy we present two scalable MapReduce algorithms for kernel k-means.

This utilizes the widely available data from different sources and caters for the current usersâ demand of receiving a result list simultaneously containing multiple types of data to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the queryâs results. To enable large-scale inter-media retrieval, we propose a novel inter-media hashing (IMH) model to explore the correlations among multiple media types from different data sources and tackle the scalability issue. To this end, multimedia data from heterogeneous data sources are transformed into a common Hamming space, in which fast search can be easily implemented by XOR and bit-count operations. Furthermore, we integrate a linear regression model to learn hashing functions so that the hash codes for new data points can be efficiently generated. Experiments conducted on real-world large-scale multimedia datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

We represent the candidate bit pool as a vertex- and edge-weighted graph with the pooled bits as vertices. Then we formulate the bit selection problem as quadratic programming over the graph, and solve it efficiently by replicator dynamics.

	<td><p>Image perceptual hashing finds applications in content indexing large-scale image database management certification and authentication and digital watermarking. We propose a Block-DCT and PCA based image perceptual hash in this article and explore the algorithm in the application of tamper detection. The main idea of the algorithm is to integrate color histogram and DCT coefficients of image blocks as perceptual feature then to compress perceptual features as inter-feature with PCA and to threshold to create a robust hash. The robustness and discrimination properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in detail. Our algorithms first construct a secondary image derived from input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately capture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which does not perceptually resemble the input) we further extract the final features which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably quantized). In this paper we use spectral matrix invariants as embodied by Singular Value Decomposition. Surprisingly formation of the secondary image turns out be quite important since it not only introduces further robustness but also enhances the security properties. Indeed our experiments reveal that our hashing algorithms extract most of the geometric information from the images and hence are robust to severe perturbations (e.g. up to 50 cropping by area with 20 degree rotations) on images while avoiding misclassification. Experimental results show that the proposed image perceptual hash algorithm can effectively address the tamper detection problem with advantageous robustness and discrimination.</p>

Our proposed method, dubbed Neighbourhood Preserving Quantization (NPQ), assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds. NPQ exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits. NPQ is not only applicable to LSH, but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme.

Realizing that heterogeneous entities and relationships are also ubiquitous in the real world applications, there is an emerging need to retrieve and search similar or relevant data entities from multiple heterogeneous domains, e.g., recommending relevant posts and images to a certain Facebook user. In this paper, we address the problem of ``comparing apples to orangesââ under the large scale setting. Specifically, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Hashing (RaHH), which provides a general framework for generating hash codes of data entities sitting in multiple heterogeneous domains. Unlike some existing hashing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space, the RaHH approach constructs a Hamming space for each type of data entities, and learns optimal mappings between them simultaneously. This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover, the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method, we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites, Tencent Weibo, and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RaHH outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods with significant performance gains.</p>

optimize parameter settings. We show that on a workload where we perform similarity search on a dataset of &gt; 1 Billion tweets, with
hundreds of millions of new tweets per day, we can achieve query times of 1â2.5 ms. We show that this is an order of magnitude faster
than existing indexing schemes, such as inverted indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest implementation of LSH,
with table construction times up to 3.7x faster and query times that are 8.3x faster than a basic implementation.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search is critical for many database applications including the increasingly popular online services for Content-Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR). These services which include image search engines must handle an overwhelming volume of data while keeping low response times. Thus scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web-scale applications but most existing methods are sequential and target shared-memory machines. Here we address these issues with a distributed efficient and scalable index based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular techniques for similarity search but its poor referential locality properties has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data storage locality-aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing and multi-probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained an efficiency of 90 in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In particular the original locality-aware data partition reduced the number of messages exchanged in 30. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with 10^9 128-d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images. This is two orders of magnitude larger than datasets that previous LSH parallelizations could handle.</p>

expectation of preserving the neighborhood structure in the original

cost, hashing has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor
search in a large variety of applications like text and image retrieval.
Most existing hashing methods adopt Hamming distance to
measure the similarity (neighborhood) between points in the hashcode
space. However, one problem with Hamming distance is that
it may destroy the neighborhood structure in the original feature
space, which violates the essential goal of hashing. In this paper,
Manhattan hashing (MH), which is based on Manhattan distance, is
proposed to solve the problem of Hamming distance based hashing.
The basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with
multiple bits of natural binary code (NBC), based on which the
Manhattan distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated
for nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the
neighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt Manhattan
distance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several largescale
image data sets containing up to one million points show that
our MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art
methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hyperplane hashing aims at rapidly searching nearest points to a hyperplane and has shown practical impact in scaling up active learning with SVMs. Unfortunately the existing randomized methods need long hash codes to achieve reasonable search accuracy and thus suffer from reduced search speed and large memory overhead. To this end this paper proposes a novel hyperplane hashing technique which yields compact hash codes. The key idea is the bilinear form of the proposed hash functions which leads to higher collision probability than the existing hyperplane hash functions when using random projections. To further increase the performance we propose a learning based framework in which the bilinear functions are directly learned from the data. This results in short yet discriminative codes and also boosts the search performance over the random projection based solutions. Large-scale active learning experiments carried out on two datasets with up to one million samples demonstrate the overall superiority of the proposed approach.</p>

Hamming distance, that is tailored to our hyperspherebased

This paper proposes a sparse representation-based approach to encode the information content of an image using information from the other image and uses the compactness (sparsity) of the representation as a measure of its compressibility (how much can the image be compressed) with respect to the other image. The more sparse the representation of an image the better it can be compressed and the more it is similar to the other image.

In this paper there will be analyzed informational content of such general task and how to practically approach such found lower boundaries. Minimal prefix tree which distinguish elements turns out to require asymptotically only about 2.77544 bits per element while standard approaches use a few times more. While being certain of working inside the database the cost of distinguishability can be reduced further to about 2.33275 bits per elements. Increasing minimal depth of nodes to reduce probability of false positives leads to simple relation with average depth of such random tree which is asymptotically larger by about 1.33275 bits than lg(n) of the perfect binary tree. This asymptotic case can be also seen as a way to optimally encode n large unordered numbers - saving lg(n!) bits of information about their ordering which can be the major part of contained information. This ability itself allows to reduce memory requirements even to about 0.693 of required in Bloom filter for the same false positive probability.</p>

	<td><p>It is shown that for cuckoo hashing with a stash as proposed by Kirsch Mitzenmacher and Wieder (2008) families of very simple hash functions can be used maintaining the favorable performance guarantees with stash size s the probability of a rehash is O(1/n^s+1) and the evaluation time is O(s). Instead of the full randomness needed for the analysis of Kirsch et al. and of Kutzelnigg (2010) (resp. Theta(log n)-wise independence for standard cuckoo hashing) the new approach even works with 2-wise independent hash families as building blocks. Both construction and analysis build upon the work of Dietzfelbinger and Woelfel (2003). The analysis which can also be applied to the fully random case utilizes a graph counting argument and is much simpler than previous proofs. As a byproduct an algorithm for simulating uniform hashing is obtained. While it requires about twice as much space as the most space efficient solutions it is attractive because of its simple and direct structure.</p>

While they are extensively studied in this context their ability to carry enough information in order to infer the original image is seldom addressed. In this work we leverage an inverse problem approach to show that it is possible to directly reconstruct the image content from Local Binary Descriptors. This process relies on very broad assumptions besides the knowledge of the pattern of the descriptor at hand. This generalizes previous results that required either a prior learning database or non-binarized features. Furthermore our reconstruction scheme reveals differences in the way different Local Binary Descriptors capture and encode image information.

	<td><p>In this paper we study several critical issues which must be tackled before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used industrial applications especially in the context of search. 1. (b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g. 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However as online algorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context of search it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for them. This paper demonstrates that b-bit minwise hashing provides an effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process. This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g. 10 to 100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix due to its space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions e.g. the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.</p>

comparing existing methods, we show that their relative performance can
change drastically depending on the definition of ground-truth neighbors.
Motivated by this finding, we propose a new formulation for learning binary
codes which seeks to reconstruct the affinity between datapoints,
rather than their distances. We show that this criterion is intractable
to solve exactly, but a spectral relaxation gives an algorithm where the
bits correspond to thresholded eigenvectors of the affinity matrix, and
as the number of datapoints goes to infinity these eigenvectors converge
to eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operators, similar to the recently
proposed Spectral Hashing (SH) method. Unlike SH whose performance
may degrade as the number of bits increases, the optimal code using
our formulation is guaranteed to faithfully reproduce the affinities as
the number of bits increases. We show that the number of eigenfunctions
needed may increase exponentially with dimension, but introduce a âkernel
trickâ to allow us to compute with an exponentially large number of
bits but using only memory and computation that grows linearly with
dimension. Experiments shows that MDSH outperforms the state-of-the

Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly a large number of hash tables (i.e. long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation we propose a novel hashing algorithm called em Density Sensitive Hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data.

Typically, the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called isotropic hashing (IsoHash), to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions, which verifies the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing, which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary
codes for data representation, has been widely
used for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive
databases due to its fast query speed and low storage
cost. Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best
binary codes for a given data set, mainstream hashing
methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the
first stage, several projected dimensions of real values
are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values
will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding.
Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to
quantize each projected dimension. One problem with
this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold
typically lies in the region of the highest point density
and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to
the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits,
which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing.
In this paper, we propose a novel quantization strategy,
called double-bit quantization (DBQ), to solve the
problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize
each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively
learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two
real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can signifi-
cantly outperform traditional SBQ strategy for hashing.</p>

	<td><p>For complex data types such as multimedia traditional data management methods are not suitable. Instead of attribute matching approaches access methods based on object similarity are becoming popular. Recently this resulted in an intensive research of indexing and searching methods for the similarity-based retrieval. Nowadays many efficient methods are already available but using them to build an actual search system still requires specialists that tune the methods and build the system manually. Several attempts have already been made to provide a more convenient high-level interface in a form of query languages for such systems but these are limited to support only basic similarity queries. In this paper we propose a new language that allows to formulate content-based queries in a flexible way taking into account the functionality offered by a particular search engine in use. To ensure this the language is based on a general data model with an abstract set of operations. Consequently the language supports various advanced query operations such as similarity joins reverse nearest neighbor queries or distinct kNN queries as well as multi-object and multi-modal queries. The language is primarily designed to be used with the MESSIF framework for content-based searching but can be employed by other retrieval systems as well.</p>

	<td><p>This paper proposes an improved steganography approach for hiding text messages in lossless RGB images. The objective of this work is to increase the security level and to improve the storage capacity with compression techniques. The security level is increased by randomly distributing the text message over the entire image instead of clustering within specific image portions. Storage capacity is increased by utilizing all the color channels for storing information and providing the source text message compression. The degradation of the images can be minimized by changing only one least significant bit per color channel for hiding the message incurring a very little change in the original image. Using steganography alone with simple LSB has a potential problem that the secret message is easily detectable from the histogram analysis method. To improve the security as well as the image embedding capacity indirectly a compression based scheme is introduced. Various tests have been done to check the storage capacity and message distribution. These testes show the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to other existing approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors such as image and speech into bit arrays and allows high-speed similarity calculation with the Hamming distance. There is a hashing scheme that maps feature vectors to bit arrays depending on the signs of the inner products between feature vectors and the normal vectors of hyperplanes placed in the feature space. This hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If labels for data are given one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning algorithms. However many proposed learning methods do not consider the hyperplanes offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes small. In this paper we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms without the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this method the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of spaces as if it takes into account the offsets. For the proposed method we input several high-dimensional feature data sets and studied the relationship between the statistical characteristics of data the number of hyperplanes and the effect of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Recently the method of b-bit minwise hashing has been applied to large-scale linear learning and sublinear time near-neighbor search. The major drawback of minwise hashing is the expensive preprocessing cost as the method requires applying (e.g.) k=200 to 500 permutations on the data. The testing time can also be expensive if a new data point (e.g. a new document or image) has not been processed which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications. We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing. Conceptually given a massive binary data matrix we permute the columns only once and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store for each data vector the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The interesting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals that our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original (k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact the one permutation scheme can be even slightly more accurate due to the sample-without-replacement effect. Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the webspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can achieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original k-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method we also experiment with the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average 500 nonzeros in each data vector. Interestingly our one permutation scheme noticeably outperforms the k-permutation scheme when k is not too small on the news20 dataset. In summary our method can achieve at least the same accuracy as the original k-permutation scheme at merely 1/k of the original preprocessing cost.</p>

One of the key challenges in similarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on the input similarity threshold.

Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures

dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to
closely fit data distribution and provide better selectivity
than usual random projections such as LSH. However, improvements
occur only for relatively small hash code sizes
up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper, this is mainly
due to the lack of independence between the produced hash
functions. We introduce a new hash function family that
attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather
than boosting the collision probability of close points, our
method focus on data scattering. By training purely random
splits of the data, regardless the closeness of the training
samples, it is indeed possible to generate consistently
more independent hash functions. On the other side, the
use of large margin classifiers allows to maintain good generalization

The results confirm our prior work that compared with the VW hashing algorithm (which has the same variance as random projections) b-bit minwise hashing is substantially more accurate at the same storage. For example with merely 30 hashed values per data point b-bit minwise hashing can achieve similar accuracies as VW with 2^14 hashed values per data point. We demonstrate that the preprocessing cost of b-bit minwise hashing is roughly on the same order of magnitude as the data loading time. Furthermore by using a GPU the preprocessing cost can be reduced to a small fraction of the data loading time. Minwise hashing has been widely used in industry at least in the context of search. One reason for its popularity is that one can efficiently simulate permutations by (e.g.) universal hashing. In other words there is no need to store the permutation matrix. In this paper we empirically verify this practice by demonstrating that even using the simplest 2-universal hashing does not degrade the learning performance.</p>

	<td><p>Cuckoo hashing 4 is a multiple choice hashing scheme in which each item can be placed in multiple locations and collisions are resolved by moving items to their alternative locations. In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo hashing the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets. Each item is hashed to two buckets and may be stored in any of the positions within those buckets. Ref. 2 analyzed a variation in which the buckets are contiguous and overlap. However many systems retrieve data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively expensive process; but once a page is fetched its contents can be accessed orders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval presenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint each bucket must be fully contained in a single page but buckets are not necessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases memory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an item. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two the page size is 8 and each bucket is fully contained in a single page the memory utilization equals 89.71 in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant 93.78 in the contiguous overlapping bucket variant and increases to 97.46 in our new non-contiguous bucket variant. When the memory utilization is 92 and we use breadth first search to look for a vacant position the number of iterations required to insert a new item is dramatically reduced from 545 in the contiguous overlapping buckets variant to 52 in our new non-contiguous bucket variant. In addition to the empirical results we present a theoretical lower bound on the memory utilization of our variation as a function of the page size.</p>

	<td><p>Given a collection of objects and an associated similarity measure the all-pairs similarity search problem asks us to find all pairs of objects with similarity greater than a certain user-specified threshold. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based methods have become a very popular approach for this problem. However most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search - i.e. efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this paper we present BayesLSH a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant BayesLSH-Lite which calculates similarities exactly is also presented. BayesLSH is able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally the quality of BayesLSHs output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate generation algorithms AllPairs and LSH BayesLSH enables significant speedups typically in the range 2x-20x for a wide variety of datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing is the standard technique in the context of search and databases for efficiently estimating set (e.g. high-dimensional 0/1 vector) similarities. Recently b-bit minwise hashing was proposed which significantly improves upon the original minwise hashing in practice by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value as opposed to using 64 bits. b-bit hashing is particularly effective in applications which mainly concern sets of high similarities (e.g. the resemblance 0.5). However there are other important applications in which not just pairs of high similarities matter. For example many learning algorithms require all pairwise similarities and it is expected that only a small fraction of the pairs are similar. Furthermore many applications care more about containment (e.g. how much one object is contained by another object) than the resemblance. In this paper we show that the estimators for minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing used in the current practice can be systematically improved and the improvements are most significant for set pairs of low resemblance and high containment.</p>

Our method provides a simple effective solution to large-scale learning in massive and extremely high-dimensional datasets especially when data do not fit in memory. We then compare b-bit minwise hashing with the Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithm (which is related the Count-Min (CM) sketch). Interestingly VW has the same variances as random projections. Our theoretical and empirical comparisons illustrate that usually b-bit minwise hashing is significantly more accurate (at the same storage) than VW (and random projections) in binary data.

Interestingly our proof for the positive definiteness of the b-bit minwise hashing kernel naturally suggests a simple strategy to integrate b-bit hashing with linear SVM. Our technique is particularly useful when the data can not fit in memory which is an increasingly critical issue in large-scale machine learning. Our preliminary experimental results on a publicly available webspam dataset (350K samples and 16 million dimensions) verified the effectiveness of our algorithm. For example the training time was reduced to merely a few seconds. In addition our technique can be easily extended to many other linear and nonlinear machine learning applications such as logistic regression.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search applications with a large amount of text
and image data demands an efficient and effective solution.
One useful strategy is to represent the examples in databases
as compact binary codes through semantic hashing, which
has attracted much attention due to its fast query/search
speed and drastically reduced storage requirement. All of
the current semantic hashing methods only deal with the
case when each example is represented by one type of features.
However, examples are often described from several
different information sources in many real world applications.
For example, the characteristics of a webpage can be
derived from both its content part and its associated links.
To address the problem of learning good hashing codes in
this scenario, we propose a novel research problem â Composite
Hashing with Multiple Information Sources (CHMIS).
The focus of the new research problem is to design an algorithm
for incorporating the features from different information
sources into the binary hashing codes efficiently and
effectively. In particular, we propose an algorithm CHMISAW
(CHMIS with Adjusted Weights) for learning the codes.
The proposed algorithm integrates information from several
different sources into the binary hashing codes by adjusting
the weights on each individual source for maximizing
the coding performance, and enables fast conversion from
query examples to their binary hashing codes. Experimental
results on five different datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method against several other
state-of-the-art semantic hashing techniques.</p>

approximate search schemes, such as the popular Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Several extensions have been proposed to
address the limitations of this algorithm, in particular, by choosing more appropriate hash functions to better partition the vector
space. All the proposed extensions, however, rely on a structured quantizer for hashing, poorly fitting real data sets, limiting
its performance in practice. In this paper, we compare several families of space hashing functions in a real setup, namely when
searching for high-dimension SIFT descriptors. The comparison of random projections, lattice quantizers, k-means and hierarchical
k-means reveal that unstructured quantizer significantly improves the accuracy of LSH, as it closely fits the data in the feature space.
We then compare two querying mechanisms introduced in the literature with the one originally proposed in LSH, and discuss their
respective merits and limitations.</p>

given in terms of labeled pairs of images. There exist supervised

The resulting summaries are useful in many applications including image indexing image authentication and pattern recognition. These hashes need to be invariant under transformations of the image that result in similar visual content but should drastically differ for conceptually distinct contents. This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a saliency graph connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph that is its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image making the hash robust to image transformation yet distinct for different visual content. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on a set of MRI 2-D slices and on a database of faces.</p>

The former problem has been extensively studied and elegantly solved in high dimensions using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. By contrast the latter problem has a complexity that is still not fully understood. We revisit the analysis of the LSH scheme for exhaustive r-pleb using a somewhat refined notion of locality-sensitive family of hash function which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in the complexity of the problem. Our analysis combined with a non-isometric lifting of the data enables us to answer exhaustive r-pleb queries (and down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way we obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries whose complexity is parametrized by some em condition number measuring the inherent difficulty of a given instance of the problem.</p>

Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing we first find the optimal l-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning and then train l classifiers via supervised learning to predict the l-bit code for any query document unseen before.

Unfortunately for memory loads beyond 0.5 little is known on its performance. In this paper we analyze its average performance over such loads. We tackle this problem by recasting the problem as an analysis of the expected maximum matching size of a given random bipartite graph. We provide exact results for any finite system and also deduce asymptotic results as the memory size increases. We further consider other variants of this problem and finally evaluate the performance of our models on Internet backbone traces. More generally our results give a tight lower bound on the size of the stash needed for any multiple-choice hashing scheme.</p>

We have compared a modified algorithm of the Dual ternary indexing algorithm for music indexing and retrieval with the multi-key hashing indexing algorithm proposed by us. The modification in the dual ternary algorithm was essential to handle variable length query phrase and to accommodate features specific to Carnatic music. The dual ternary indexing algorithm is adapted for Carnatic music by segmenting using the segmentation technique for Carnatic music. The dual ternary algorithm is compared with the multi-key hashing algorithm designed by us for indexing and retrieval in which features like MFCC spectral flux melody string and spectral centroid are used as features for indexing data into a hash table. The way in which collision resolution was handled by this hash table is different than the normal hash table approaches. It was observed that multi-key hashing based retrieval had a lesser time complexity than dual-ternary based indexing The algorithms were also compared for their precision and recall in which multi-key hashing had a better recall than modified dual ternary indexing for the sample data considered.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search methods are widely used as kernels in various machine learning applications. Nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms are often used to retrieve similar entries given a query. While there exist efficient techniques for exact query lookup using hashing similarity search using exact nearest neighbors is known to be a hard problem and in high dimensions best known solutions offer little improvement over a linear scan. Fast solutions to the approximate NNS problem include Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based techniques which need storage polynomial in n with exponent greater than 1 and query time sublinear but still polynomial in n where n is the size of the database. In this work we present a new technique of solving the approximate NNS problem in Euclidean space using a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) which needs near linear space and has O(1) query time. In fact this method also works around the best known lower bounds in the cell probe model for the query time using a data structure near linear in the size of the data base. TCAMs are high performance associative memories widely used in networking applications such as access control lists. A TCAM can query for a bit vector within a database of ternary vectors where every bit position represents 0 1 or . The is a wild card representing either a 0 or a 1. We leverage TCAMs to design a variant of LSH called Ternary Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) wherein we hash database entries represented by vectors in the Euclidean space into 01. By using the added functionality of a TLSH scheme with respect to the character we solve an instance of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with 1 TCAM access and storage nearly linear in the size of the database. We believe that this work can open new avenues in very high speed data mining.</p>

Our second approach embeds the data into a vector space where the Euclidean norm reflects the desired distance between the original points and hyperplane query. Both use hashing to retrieve near points in sub-linear time. Our first methodâs preprocessing stage is more efficient, while the second has stronger accuracy guarantees. We apply both to pool-based active learning: taking the current hyperplane classifier as a query, our algorithm identifies those points (approximately) satisfying the well-known minimal distance-to-hyperplane selection criterion.

	<td><p>The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called âImageNetâ, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.</p>

	<td><p>Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It
is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous
researchers who have tried this have found it difficult to learn a good set of
filters from the images.
We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which
resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute
the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be
done in reasonable time.
A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels
which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels.
The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of
each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is significantly
improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.</p>

These functions are used in different levels of hash tables that are coded in Java Programming Language and a quite number of data records serve as primary data for testing the performances. The result shows that the two-level hash tables with three different hash functions give a superior performance over one-level hash table with two hash functions or zero-level hash table with one function in term of reducing the conflict keys and quick lookup for a particular element. The result assists to reduce the complexity of join operation in query language from O(n2) to O(1) by placing larger query result if any in multilevel hash tables with multiple hash functions and generate shorter query result.</p>

	<td><p>We study lower bounds for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in the strongest setting point sets in 01^d under the Hamming distance. Recall that here H is said to be an (r cr p q)-sensitive hash family if all pairs x y in 01^d with dist(xy) at most r have probability at least p of collision under a randomly chosen h in H whereas all pairs x y in 01^d with dist(xy) at least cr have probability at most q of collision. Typically one considers d tending to infinity with c fixed and q bounded away from 0. For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensions the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its rho parameter rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c the extremely simple family H = x - x_i i in d achieves rho at most 1/c. The only known lower bound due to Motwani Naor and Panigrahy is that rho must be at least .46/c (minus o_d(1)). In this paper we show an optimal lower bound rho must be at least 1/c (minus o_d(1)). This lower bound for Hamming space yields a lower bound of 1/c^2 for Euclidean space (or the unit sphere) and 1/c for the Jaccard distance on sets; both of these match known upper bounds. Our proof is simple; the essence is that the noise stability of a boolean function at e^-t is a log-convex function of t.</p>

In the context of the SAPIR (Search on Audio-visual content using Peer-to-peer Information Retrieval) European project we had to experiment our distributed similarity searching technology on a realistic data set. Therefore since no large-scale collection was available for research purposes we had to tackle the non-trivial process of image crawling and descriptive feature extraction (we used five MPEG-7 features) using the European EGEE computer GRID. The result of this effort is CoPhIR the first CBIR test collection of such scale. CoPhIR is now open to the research community for experiments and comparisons and access to the collection was already granted to more than 50 research groups worldwide.</p>

We provide improved bounds on how much min-entropy per item is required for this to hold both when we ask that the output be close to uniform in statistical distance and when we only ask that it be statistically close to a distribution with small collision probability.

The algorithm retains its efficiency advantages in a wide variety of sequence matching problems of practical interest including traditional string matching; large-alphabet problems (as in Unicode strings); and small-alphabet long-pattern problems (as in DNA searches). Since it is expressed as a generic algorithm for searching in sequences over an arbitrary type T it is well suited for use in generic software libraries such as the C++ Standard Template Library. The algorithm was obtained by adding to the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm one of the pattern-shifting techniques from the Boyer-Moore algorithm with provision for use of hashing in this technique. In situations in which a hash function or random access to the sequences is not available the algorithm falls back to an optimized version of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.</p>

	<td><p>We suggest a method for holding a dictionary data structure which maps keys to values in the spirit of Bloom Filters. The space requirements of the dictionary we suggest are much smaller than those of a hashtable. We allow storing n keys each mapped to value which is a string of k bits. Our suggested method requires nk + o(n) bits space to store the dictionary and O(n) time to produce the data structure and allows answering a membership query in O(1) memory probes. The dictionary size does not depend on the size of the keys. However reducing the space requirements of the data structure comes at a certain cost. Our dictionary has a small probability of a one sided error. When attempting to obtain the value for a key that is stored in the dictionary we always get the correct answer. However when testing for membership of an element that is not stored in the dictionary we may get an incorrect answer and when requesting the value of such an element we may get a certain random value. Our method is based on solving equations in GF(2^k) and using several hash functions. Another significant advantage of our suggested method is that we do not require using sophisticated hash functions. We only require pairwise independent hash functions. We also suggest a data structure that requires only nk bits space has O(n2) preprocessing time and has a O(log n) query time. However this data structures requires a uniform hash functions. In order replace a Bloom Filter of n elements with an error proability of 2^-k we require nk + o(n) memory bits O(1) query time O(n) preprocessing time and only pairwise independent hash function. Even the most advanced previously known Bloom Filter would require nk+O(n) space and a uniform hash functions so our method is significantly less space consuming especially when k is small.</p>

We will investigate a large natural class of algorithms which we call bucketing codes. We will define bucketing information prove that it bounds the performance of all bucketing codes and that the bucketing information bound can be asymptotically attained by randomly constructed bucketing codes. For example suppose we have n Bernoulli(1/2) very long (length dâinfinity) sequences of bits. Let n-2m sequences be completely independent while the remaining 2m sequences are composed of m independent pairs. The interdependence within each pair is that their bits agree with probability 1/2&lt;p&lt;=1. It is well known how to find most pairs with high probability by performing order of n^log_22/p comparisons. We will see that order of n^1/p+epsilon comparisons suffice for any epsilon0. Moreover if one sequence out of each pair belongs to a a known set of n^(2p-1)^2-epsilon sequences than pairing can be done using order n comparisons!</p>

Recently it has been shown that adaptations of classical exact string matching algorithms are not very efficient on binary data.

data. Recently, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its
variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for
approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of
these approaches is the requirement for a large number of
hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH
that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on
the well-known LSH technique, but it intelligently probes
multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in
a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon
recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to
reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We
have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional
datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH
method substantially improves upon previously proposed
methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the
same search quality, multi-probe LSH has a similar timeefficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison
with the entropy-based LSH method, to achieve the same
search quality, multi-probe LSH uses less query time and 5
to 8 times fewer number of hash tables.</p>

	<td><p>Perfect hash functions can potentially be used to compress data in connection with a variety of data management tasks. Though there has been considerable work on how to construct good perfect hash functions there is a gap between theory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On one side there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven practicality for large key sets. On the other side there are the theoretically analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash functions are available for free which is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice using a number of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel theoretically optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods and the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64 for which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the range 0â¦2n-1 the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e. one bit more than optimal for representing the key). This is significantly below of what has been achieved previously for very large values of n.</p>

We prove that a one-pass one-hash algorithm is sufficient for accurate estimates if the hashing is sufficiently independent. To reduce costs further we investigate recursive random hashing algorithms and show that they are sufficiently independent in practice. We compare our running times with exact counts using suffix arrays and show that while we use hardly any storage we are an order of magnitude faster.

Unfortunately previous analysis rely either on complicated and space consuming hash functions or on the unrealistic assumption of free access to a truly random hash function. Already Carter and Wegman in their seminal paper on universal hashing raised the question of extending their analysis to linear probing. However we show in this paper that linear probing using a pairwise independent family may have expected em logarithmic cost per operation. On the positive side we show that 5-wise independence is enough to ensure constant expected time per operation.

We also obtain a space-efficient version of the algorithm, which uses dn+n logO(1) n space, with a query time of dnO(1/c2).

	<td><p>In this paper we study the problem of finding the approximate nearest neighbor of a query point in the high dimensional space focusing on the Euclidean space. The earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions (that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash tables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest neighbor in at least one table. Our approach is different â we use one (or a few) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket containing its nearest neighbor. We show that the number of randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point q required depends on the entropy of the hash value h(p) of a random point p at the same distance from q at its nearest neighbor given q and the locality preserving hash function h chosen randomly from the hash family. Precisely we show that if the entropy I(h(p)qh) = M and g is a bound on the probability that two far-off points will hash to the same bucket then we can find the approximate nearest neighbor in O(n^rho) time and near linear tilde O(n) space where rho = M/log(1/g). Alternatively we can build a data structure of size tilde O(n^1/(1-rho)) to answer queries in tilde O(d) time. By applying this analysis to the locality preserving hash functions in and adjusting the parameters we show that the c nearest neighbor can be computed in time tilde O(n^rho) and near linear space where rho approx 2.06/c as c becomes large.</p>

engines desire fast, parallel, main-memory-based indexes for similarity search on text data; database systems desire disk-based similarity indexes for high-dimensional data, including text and images;
peer-to-peer systems desire distributed similarity indexes with low
communication cost. We propose an indexing scheme called LSH
Forest which is applicable in all the above contexts. Our index uses the well-known technique of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH),
but improves upon previous designs by (a) eliminating the different data-dependent parameters for which LSH must be constantly hand-tuned, and (b) improving on LSHâs performance guarantees for skewed data distributions while retaining the same storage
and query overhead. We show how to construct this index in main
memory, on disk, in parallel systems, and in peer-to-peer systems.
We evaluate the design with experiments on multiple text corpora
and demonstrate both the self-tuning nature and the superior performance of LSH Forest.</p>

	<td><p>The study of hashing is closely related to the analysis of balls and bins. It is well-known that instead of using a single hash function if we randomly hash a ball into two bins and place it in the smaller of the two then this dramatically lowers the maximum load on bins. This leads to the concept of two-way hashing where the largest bucket contains O(loglog n) balls with high probability. The hash look up will now search in both the buckets an item hashes to. Since an item may be placed in one of two buckets we could potentially move an item after it has been initially placed to reduce maximum load. with a maximum load of We show that by performing moves during inserts a maximum load of 2 can be maintained on-line with high probability while supporting hash update operations. In fact with n buckets even if the space for two items are pre-allocated per bucket as may be desirable in hardware implementations more than n items can be stored giving a high memory utilization. We also analyze the trade-off between the number of moves performed during inserts and the maximum load on a bucket. By performing at most h moves we can maintain a maximum load of O(h log(loglog n/h)). So even by performing one move we achieve a better bound than by performing no moves at all.</p>

	<td><p>Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications. Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance. The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor â even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.</p>

The method proposed narrows the possibility of the latter kind of collision achieving small code and memory-size utilization and very fast execution. Hashing is achieved using additive rotating hash functions in an iterative form which can be very easily implemented in simple microcontrollers and microprocessors.

	<td><p>The nearest- or near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety of database applications, usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately,
all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality;
in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence that our
method gives significant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition.
Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50).</p>
