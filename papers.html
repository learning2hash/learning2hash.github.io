	<td><p>Known for efficient computation and easy storage hashing has been extensively explored in cross-modal retrieval. The majority of current hashing models are predicated on the premise of a direct one-to-one mapping between data points. However in real practice data correspondence across modalities may be partially provided. In this research we introduce an innovative unsupervised hashing technique designed for semi-paired cross-modal retrieval tasks named Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing (RREH). RREH assumes that multi-modal data share a common subspace. For paired data RREH explores the latent consistent information of heterogeneous modalities by seeking a shared representation. For unpaired data to effectively capture the latent discriminative features the high-order relationships between unpaired data and anchors are embedded into the latent subspace which are computed by efficient linear reconstruction. The anchors are sampled from paired data which improves the efficiency of hash learning. The RREH trains the underlying features and the binary encodings in a unified framework with high-order reconstruction relations preserved. With the well devised objective function and discrete optimization algorithm RREH is designed to be scalable making it suitable for large-scale datasets and facilitating efficient cross-modal retrieval. In the evaluation process the proposed is tested with partially paired data to establish its superiority over several existing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a fundamental algorithmic technique widely employed in large-scale data processing applications such as nearest-neighbor search entity resolution and clustering. However its applicability in some real-world scenarios is limited due to the need for careful design of hashing functions that align with specific metrics. Existing LSH-based Entity Blocking solutions primarily rely on generic similarity metrics such as Jaccard similarity whereas practical use cases often demand complex and customized similarity rules surpassing the capabilities of generic similarity metrics. Consequently designing LSH functions for these customized similarity rules presents considerable challenges. In this research we propose a neuralization approach to enhance locality-sensitive hashing by training deep neural networks to serve as hashing functions for complex metrics. We assess the effectiveness of this approach within the context of the entity resolution problem which frequently involves the use of task-specific metrics in real-world applications. Specifically we introduce NLSHBlock (Neural-LSH Block) a novel blocking methodology that leverages pre-trained language models fine-tuned with a novel LSH-based loss function. Through extensive evaluations conducted on a diverse range of real-world datasets we demonstrate the superiority of NLSHBlock over existing methods exhibiting significant performance improvements. Furthermore we showcase the efficacy of NLSHBlock in enhancing the performance of the entity matching phase particularly within the semi-supervised setting.</p>

	<td><p>Implementing cross-modal hashing between 2D images and 3D point-cloud data is a growing concern in real-world retrieval systems. Simply applying existing cross-modal approaches to this new task fails to adequately capture latent multi-modal semantics and effectively bridge the modality gap between 2D and 3D. To address these issues without relying on hand-crafted labels we propose contrastive masked autoencoders based self-supervised hashing (CMAH) for retrieval between images and point-cloud data. We start by contrasting 2D-3D pairs and explicitly constraining them into a joint Hamming space. This contrastive learning process ensures robust discriminability for the generated hash codes and effectively reduces the modality gap. Moreover we utilize multi-modal auto-encoders to enhance the models understanding of multi-modal semantics. By completing the masked image/point-cloud data modeling task the model is encouraged to capture more localized clues. In addition the proposed multi-modal fusion block facilitates fine-grained interactions among different modalities. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed CMAH significantly outperforms all baseline methods.</p>

To avoid expensive comparisons between entries, blocking similar items is a popular preprocessing step. In this paper, we introduce BlockBoost, a novel boosting-based method that generates compact binary hash codes for database entries, through which blocking can be performed efficiently. The algorithm is fast and scalable, resulting in computational costs that are orders of magnitude lower than current benchmarks. Unlike existing alternatives, BlockBoost comes with associated feature importance measures for interpretability, and possesses strong theoretical guarantees, including lower bounds on critical performance metrics like recall and reduction ratio. Finally, we show that BlockBoost delivers great empirical results, outperforming state-of-the-art blocking benchmarks in terms of both performance metrics and computational cost.</p>

	<td><p>Existing fine-grained hashing methods typically lack code interpretability as they compute hash code bits holistically using both global and local features. To address this limitation we propose ConceptHash a novel method that achieves sub-code level interpretability. In ConceptHash each sub-code corresponds to a human-understandable concept such as an object part and these concepts are automatically discovered without human annotations. Specifically we leverage a Vision Transformer architecture and introduce concept tokens as visual prompts along with image patch tokens as model inputs. Each concept is then mapped to a specific sub-code at the model output providing natural sub-code interpretability. To capture subtle visual differences among highly similar sub-categories (e.g. bird species) we incorporate language guidance to ensure that the learned hash codes are distinguishable within fine-grained object classes while maintaining semantic alignment. This approach allows us to develop hash codes that exhibit similarity within families of species while remaining distinct from species in other families. Extensive experiments on four fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that ConceptHash outperforms previous methods by a significant margin offering unique sub-code interpretability as an additional benefit.

	<td><p>Consistent range-hashing is a technique used in distributed systems either directly or as a subroutine for consistent hashing commonly to realize an even and stable data distribution over a variable number of resources. We introduce FlipHash a consistent range-hashing algorithm with constant time complexity and low memory requirements. Like Jump Consistent Hash FlipHash is intended for applications where resources can be indexed sequentially. Under this condition it ensures that keys are hashed evenly across resources and that changing the number of resources only causes keys to be remapped from a removed resource or to an added one but never shuffled across persisted ones. FlipHash differentiates itself with its low computational cost achieving constant-time complexity. We show that FlipHash beats Jump Consistent Hashs cost which is logarithmic in the number of resources both theoretically and in experiments over practical settings.</p>

	<td><p>This article studies deep unsupervised hashing, which has attracted increasing attention in large-scale image retrieval. The majority of recent approaches usually reconstruct semantic similarity information, which then guides the hash code learning. However, they still fail to achieve satisfactory performance in reality for two reasons. On the one hand, without accurate supervised information, these methods usually fail to produce independent and robust hash codes with semantics information well preserved, which may hinder effective image retrieval. On the other hand, due to discrete constraints, how to effectively optimize the hashing network in an end-to-end manner with small quantization errors remains a problem. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method called HARR to learn discriminative and high-quality hash codes. To comprehensively explore semantic similarity structure, HARR adopts the Winner-Take-All hash to model the similarity structure. Then similarity-preserving hash codes are learned under the reliable guidance of the reconstructed similarity structure. Additionally, we improve the quality of hash codes by a bit correlation reduction module, which forces the cross-correlation matrix between a batch of hash codes under different augmentations to approach the identity matrix. In this way, the generated hash bits are expected to be invariant to disturbances with minimal redundancy, which can be further interpreted as an instantiation of the information bottleneck principle. Finally, for effective hashing network training, we minimize the cosine distances between real-value network outputs and their binary codes for small quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HARR.</p>

Specifically we use the VLP as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teacher to distill knowledge into a </code>student hashing model equipped with codebooks. This process involves the replacement of supervised labels which are composed of multi-hot vectors and lack semantics with the rich semantics of VLP. In the end we apply a transformation termed Normalization with Paired Consistency (NPC) to achieve a discriminative target for distillation. Further we introduce a new quantization method Product Quantization with Gumbel (PQG) that promotes balanced codebook learning thereby improving the retrieval performance. Extensive benchmark testing demonstrates that DCMQ consistently outperforms existing supervised cross-modal hashing approaches showcasing its significant potential.</p>

	<td><p>Deep image hashing aims to map input images into simple binary hash codes via deep neural networks and thus enable effective large-scale image retrieval. Recently hybrid networks that combine convolution and Transformer have achieved superior performance on various computer tasks and have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless the potential benefits of such hybrid networks in image retrieval still need to be verified. To this end we propose a hybrid convolutional and self-attention deep hashing method known as HybridHash. Specifically we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture in which the block aggregation function is introduced to achieve the effect of local self-attention and reduce the computational complexity. The interaction module has been elaborately designed to promote the communication of information between image blocks and to enhance the visual representations. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper has superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.

This raises the question whether performance can be further improved by increasing the number of entries that fit in such buckets. Known compact hashing techniques have not yet been adapted to the massively parallel setting nor have they been evaluated on the GPU. We consider a compact version of bucketed cuckoo hashing and a version of compact iceberg hashing suitable for the GPU. We discuss the tables from a theoretical perspective and provide an open source implementation of both schemes in CUDA for comparative benchmarking. In terms of performance the state-of-the-art cuckoo hashing benefits from compactness on lookups and insertions (most experiments show at least 10-20 increase in throughput) and the iceberg table benefits significantly to the point of being comparable to compact cuckoo hashing–while supporting performant dynamic operation.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised semantic hashing has emerged as an indispensable technique for fast image search which aims to convert images into binary hash codes without relying on labels. Recent advancements in the field demonstrate that employing large-scale backbones (e.g. ViT) in unsupervised semantic hashing models can yield substantial improvements. However the inference delay has become increasingly difficult to overlook. Knowledge distillation provides a means for practical model compression to alleviate this delay. Nevertheless the prevailing knowledge distillation approaches are not explicitly designed for semantic hashing. They ignore the unique search paradigm of semantic hashing the inherent necessities of the distillation process and the property of hash codes. In this paper we propose an innovative Bit-mask Robust Contrastive knowledge Distillation (BRCD) method specifically devised for the distillation of semantic hashing models. To ensure the effectiveness of two kinds of search paradigms in the context of semantic hashing BRCD first aligns the semantic spaces between the teacher and student models through a contrastive knowledge distillation objective. Additionally to eliminate noisy augmentations and ensure robust optimization a cluster-based method within the knowledge distillation process is introduced. Furthermore through a bit-level analysis we uncover the presence of redundancy bits resulting from the bit independence property. To mitigate these effects we introduce a bit mask mechanism in our knowledge distillation objective. Finally extensive experiments not only showcase the noteworthy performance of our BRCD method in comparison to other knowledge distillation methods but also substantiate the generality of our methods across diverse semantic hashing models and backbones. The code for BRCD is available at httpsgithub.com/hly1998/BRCD.</p>

Traditional VS methods such as docking are often too time-consuming for screening large-scale molecular databases. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated that learning vector representations for both proteins and molecules using contrastive learning can outperform traditional docking methods. However given that target databases often contain billions of molecules real-valued vector representations adopted by existing methods can still incur significant memory and time costs in VS. To address this problem in this paper we propose a hashing-based contrastive learning method called DrugHash for VS. DrugHash treats VS as a retrieval task that uses efficient binary hash codes for retrieval. In particular DrugHash designs a simple yet effective hashing strategy to enable end-to-end learning of binary hash codes for both protein and molecule modalities which can dramatically reduce the memory and time costs with higher accuracy compared with existing methods. Experimental results show that DrugHash can outperform existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with a memory saving of 32times and a speed improvement of 3.5times.</p>

	<td><p>The target of cross-modal hashing is to embed heterogeneous multimedia data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, which plays a pivotal part in multimedia retrieval due to the emergence of big multimodal data. Recently, matrix factorization has achieved great success in cross-modal hashing. However, how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization, which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function, leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover, the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search, and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy. The experimental results on two benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Searching on bipartite graphs serves as a fundamental task for various real-world applications such as recommendation systems database retrieval and document querying. Conventional approaches rely on similarity matching in continuous Euclidean space of vectorized node embeddings. To handle intensive similarity computation efficiently hashing techniques for graph-structured data have emerged as a prominent research direction. However despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space previous studies have encountered catastrophic performance decay. To address this challenge we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network for effective Top-N search. Our findings indicate the learning effectiveness of incorporating hashing techniques within the exploration of bipartite graph reception fields as opposed to simply treating hashing as post-processing to output embeddings. To further enhance the model performance we advance upon these findings and propose Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing (BGCH+). BGCH+ introduces a novel dual augmentation approach to both intermediate information and hash code outputs in the latent feature spaces thereby producing more expressive and robust hash codes within a dual self-supervised learning paradigm. Comprehensive empirical analyses on six real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our dual feature contrastive learning in boosting the performance of BGCH+ compared to existing approaches.</p>

In this paper we study the robustness of the locality-sensitive hashing to adaptive queries in Hamming space.

	<td><p>Hashing methods have made significant progress in cross-modal retrieval tasks with fast query speed and low storage cost. Among them deep learning-based hashing achieves better performance on large-scale data due to its excellent extraction and representation ability for nonlinear heterogeneous features. However there are still two main challenges in catastrophic forgetting when data with new categories arrive continuously and time-consuming for non-continuous hashing retrieval to retrain for updating. To this end we in this paper propose a novel deep lifelong cross-modal hashing to achieve lifelong hashing retrieval instead of re-training hash function repeatedly when new data arrive. Specifically we design lifelong learning strategy to update hash functions by directly training the incremental data instead of retraining new hash functions using all the accumulated data which significantly reduce training time. Then we propose lifelong hashing loss to enable original hash codes participate in lifelong learning but remain invariant and further preserve the similarity and dis-similarity among original and incremental hash codes to maintain performance. Additionally considering distribution heterogeneity when new data arriving continuously we introduce multi-label semantic similarity to supervise hash learning and it has been proven that the similarity improves performance with detailed analysis. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieves comparative performance comparing with recent state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods and it yields substantial average increments over 20 in retrieval accuracy and almost reduces over 80 training time when new data arrives continuously.</p>

In particular we design three criteria from the perspectives of hamming distance quantization loss and denoising to defend against both untargeted and targeted attacks which collectively limit the adversarial space.

	<td><p>Representing visual data using compact binary codes is attracting increasing attention as binary codes are used as direct indices into hash table(s) for fast non-exhaustive search. Recent methods show that ranking binary codes using weighted Hamming distance (WHD) rather than Hamming distance (HD) by generating query-adaptive weights for each bit can better retrieve query-related items. However search using WHD is slower than that using HD. One main challenge is that the complexity of extending a monotone increasing sequence using WHD to probe buckets in hash table(s) for existing methods is at least proportional to the square of the sequence length while that using HD is proportional to the sequence length. To overcome this challenge we propose a novel fast non-exhaustive search method using WHD. The key idea is to design a constant sequence extension algorithm to perform each sequence extension in constant computational complexity and the total complexity is proportional to the sequence length which is justified by theoretical analysis. Experimental results show that our method is faster than other WHD-based search methods. Also compared with the HD-based non-exhaustive search method our method has comparable efficiency but retrieves more query-related items for the dataset of up to one billion items.</p>

	<td><p>Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e. the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically based on the captured visual representations by attention we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then driven by preserving original entities similarity the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods.</p>

Previous efforts formulate video hashing as training a binary auto-encoder, for which noncontinuous latent representations are optimized by the biased straight-through (ST) back-propagation heuristic. We propose to formulate video hashing as learning a discrete variational auto-encoder with the factorized Bernoulli latent distribution, termed as Bernoulli variational auto-encoder (BerVAE). The corresponding evidence lower bound (ELBO) in our BerVAE implementation leads to closed-form gradient expression, which can be applied to achieve principled training along with some other unbiased gradient estimators. BerVAE enables uncertainty-aware video hashing by predicting the probability distribution of video hash code-words, thus providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Experiments on both simulated and real-world large-scale video data demonstrate that our BerVAE trained with unbiased gradient estimators can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Furthermore, we show that quantified uncertainty is highly correlated to video retrieval performance, which can be leveraged to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been extensively applied to massive image retrieval due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recently several adversarial attacks have been presented to reveal the vulnerability of deep hashing models against adversarial examples. However existing attack methods suffer from degraded performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations between original samples or spend a lot of time learning these relations with a deep neural network. In this paper we propose a novel Pharos-guided Attack dubbed PgA to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep hashing networks reliably and efficiently. Specifically we design pharos code to represent the semantics of the benign image which preserves the similarity to semantically relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly PgA can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in both attack strength and speed.</p>

Existing unsupervised hashing methods attempt to exploit the valuable information from samples which fails to take the local geometric structure of unlabeled samples into consideration. Moreover hashing based on auto-encoders aims to minimize the reconstruction loss between the input data and binary codes which ignores the potential consistency and complementarity of multiple sources data. To address the above issues we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view binary clustering which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank constraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and affinity graphs to learn a unified binary code called Graph-Collaborated Auto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE). Specifically we propose a multi-view affinity graphs learning model with low-rank constraint which can mine the underlying geometric information from multi-view data. Then we design an encoder-decoder paradigm to collaborate the multiple affinity graphs which can learn a unified binary code effectively. Notably we impose the decorrelation and code balance constraints on binary codes to reduce the quantization errors. Finally we utilize an alternating iterative optimization scheme to obtain the multi-view clustering results. Extensive experimental results on 5 public datasets are provided to reveal the effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance over other state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

Although numerous existing approaches attempt to incorporate transfer learning techniques into deep hashing frameworks, they often neglect the essential invariance for adequate alignment between these two domains. Worse yet, these methods fail to distinguish between causal and non-causal effects embedded in images, rendering cross-domain retrieval ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose an Invariance-acquired Domain AdaptivE HAshing (IDEA) model. Our IDEA first decomposes each image into a causal feature representing label information, and a non-causal feature indicating domain information. Subsequently, we generate discriminative hash codes using causal features with consistency learning on both source and target domains. More importantly, we employ a generative model for synthetic samples to simulate the intervention of various non-causal effects, ultimately minimizing their impact on hash codes for domain invariance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our IDEA compared to a variety of competitive baselines.</p>

The cost of hashing is proportional to data dimensions and thus often the performance bottleneck when dimensionality is high and the number of hash functions involved is large. Surprisingly however little work has been done to improve the efficiency of LSH computation. In this paper we design a simple yet efficient LSH scheme named FastLSH under l2 norm. By combining random sampling and random projection FastLSH reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(m) (m&lt;n) where n is the data dimensionality and m is the number of sampled dimensions. Moreover FastLSH has provable LSH property which distinguishes it from the non-LSH fast sketches. We conduct comprehensive experiments over a collection of real and synthetic datasets for the nearest neighbor search task. Experimental results demonstrate that FastLSH is on par with the state-of-the-arts in terms of answer quality space occupation and query efficiency while enjoying up to 80x speedup in hash function evaluation. We believe that FastLSH is a promising alternative to the classic LSH scheme.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is at the heart of large-scale image similarity search and recent methods have been substantially improved through deep learning techniques. Such algorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a subsequent costly binarization step a common solution is to employ loss functions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are grouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that the embedding entries are close to binarized entries e.g. -1 or 1). Still the interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the embeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that decomposes the learning problem in two stages first perform similarity learning over the embedding space with no quantization; second find an optimal orthogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding is close to its sign and then quantize the transformed embedding through the sign function. In the second step we parametrize orthogonal transformations using Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent. Since similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal transformations this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of performance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised fast hyperparameter-free and can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning algorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets and unlike other quantization strategies brings consistent improvements in performance to existing deep hashing algorithms.</p>

Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models that is adversarial vulnerability. Notably it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further we for the first time formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms meanwhile the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

However these methods often overlook the fact that the similarity between data points in the continuous feature space may not be preserved in the discrete hash code space due to the limited similarity range of hash codes. The similarity range is bounded by the code length and can lead to a problem known as similarity collapse. That is the positive and negative pairs of data points become less distinguishable from each other in the hash space. To alleviate this problem in this paper a novel Similarity Distribution Calibration (SDC) method is introduced. SDC aligns the hash code similarity distribution towards a calibration distribution (e.g. beta distribution) with sufficient spread across the entire similarity range thus alleviating the similarity collapse problem. Extensive experiments show that our SDC outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art alternatives on coarse category-level and instance-level image retrieval.

To describe objects with similar overall appearance but subtle differences more and more studies focus on hashing-based fine-grained image retrieval. Existing hashing networks usually generate both local and global features through attention guidance on the same deep activation tensor which limits the diversity of feature representations. To handle this limitation we substitute convolutional descriptors for attention-guided features and propose an Attributes Grouping and Mining Hashing (AGMH) which groups and embeds the category-specific visual attributes in multiple descriptors to generate a comprehensive feature representation for efficient fine-grained image retrieval. Specifically an Attention Dispersion Loss (ADL) is designed to force the descriptors to attend to various local regions and capture diverse subtle details. Moreover we propose a Stepwise Interactive External Attention (SIEA) to mine critical attributes in each descriptor and construct correlations between fine-grained attributes and objects. The attention mechanism is dedicated to learning discrete attributes which will not cost additional computations in hash codes generation. Finally the compact binary codes are learned by preserving pairwise similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that AGMH consistently yields the best performance against state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>An efficient solution to the large-scale recommender system is to represent users and items as binary hash codes in the Hamming space. Towards this end existing methods tend to code users by modeling their Hamming similarities with the items they historically interact with which are termed as the first-order similarities in this work. Despite their efficiency these methods suffer from the suboptimal representative capacity since they forgo the correlation established by connecting multiple first-order similarities i.e. the relation among the indirect instances which could be defined as the high-order similarity. To tackle this drawback we propose to model both the first- and the high-order similarities in the Hamming space through the user-item bipartite graph. Therefore we develop a novel learning to hash framework namely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN) which explicitly models the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing models and obtains performance comparable with the real-valued recommendation models.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing has received extensive research focus on the past decade which typically aims at preserving a predefined metric (i.e. Euclidean metric) in the Hamming space. To this end the encoding functions of the existing hashing are typically quasi-isometric which devote to reducing the quantization loss from the target metric space to the discrete Hamming space. However it is indeed problematic to directly minimize such error since such mentioned two metric spaces are heterogeneous and the quasi-isometric mapping is non-linear. The former leads to inconsistent feature distributions while the latter leads to problematic optimization issues. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method termed Sparsity-Induced Generative Adversarial Hashing (SiGAH) to encode large-scale high-dimensional features into binary codes which well solves the two problems through a generative adversarial training framework. Instead of minimizing the quantization loss our key innovation lies in enforcing the learned Hamming space to have similar data distribution to the target metric space via a generative model. In particular we formulate a ReLU-based neural network as a generator to output binary codes and an MSE-loss based auto-encoder network as a discriminator upon which a generative adversarial learning is carried out to train hash functions. Furthermore to generate the synthetic features from the hash codes a compressed sensing procedure is introduced into the generative model which enforces the reconstruction boundary of binary codes to be consistent with that of original features. Finally such generative adversarial framework can be trained via the Adam optimizer. Experimental results on four benchmarks i.e. Tiny100K GIST1M Deep1M and MNIST have shown that the proposed SiGAH has superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised video hashing usually optimizes binary codes by learning to reconstruct input videos. Such reconstruction constraint spends much effort on frame-level temporal context changes without focusing on video-level global semantics that are more useful for retrieval. Hence we address this problem by decomposing video information into reconstruction-dependent and semantic-dependent information which disentangles the semantic extraction from reconstruction constraint. Specifically we first design a simple dual-stream structure including a temporal layer and a hash layer. Then with the help of semantic similarity knowledge obtained from self-supervision the hash layer learns to capture information for semantic retrieval while the temporal layer learns to capture the information for reconstruction. In this way the model naturally preserves the disentangled semantics into binary codes. Validated by comprehensive experiments our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on three video benchmarks.</p>

The paper proposes a fast consistent hash algorithm (called power consistent hash) that has O(1) expected time for key lookup independent of the number of buckets. Hash values are computed in real time. No search data structure is constructed to store bucket ranges or key mappings. The algorithm has a lightweight design using O(1) space with superior scalability. In particular it uses two auxiliary hash functions to achieve distribution uniformity and O(1) expected time for key lookup. Furthermore it performs consistent hashing such that only a minimal number of keys are remapped when the number of buckets changes. Consistent hashing has a wide range of use cases including load balancing distributed caching and distributed key-value stores. The proposed algorithm is faster than well-known consistent hash algorithms with O(log n) lookup time.</p>

	<td><p>A minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) maps a set S of n keys to the first n integers without collisions. There is a lower bound of nlog(e)=1.44n bits needed to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm that tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed leading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for constructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building block. In this paper we introduce ShockHash - Small heavily overloaded cuckoo hash tables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and h_1 hoping for the existence of a function f S-0 1 such that x - h_f(x)(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to store f using n + o(n) bits. In graph terminology ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until stumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as nodes. Using cuckoo hashing ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the pseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about (e/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the seed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space consumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to brute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again to 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all possible pairs. ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be constructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches. It can build an MPHF for 10 million keys with 1.489 bits per key in about half an hour. When instead using ShockHash after an efficient k-perfect hash function it achieves space usage similar to the best competitors while being significantly faster to construct and query.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years, a number of online hashing methods have emerged, which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However, existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives, which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand, these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples, especially in the multi-label case. In this paper, we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific, we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives, only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition, we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

To solve this problem we propose a new baseline CLIP Multi-modal Hashing (CLIPMH) method. It uses CLIP model to extract text and image features and then fuse to generate hash code. CLIP improves the expressiveness of each modal feature. In this way it can greatly improve the retrieval performance of multi-modal hashing methods.

	<td><p>Hash representation learning of multi-view heterogeneous data is the key to improving the accuracy of multimedia retrieval. However existing methods utilize local similarity and fall short of deeply fusing the multi-view features resulting in poor retrieval accuracy. Current methods only use local similarity to train their model. These methods ignore global similarity. Furthermore most recent works fuse the multi-view features via a weighted sum or concatenation. We contend that these fusion methods are insufficient for capturing the interaction between various views. We present a novel Central Similarity Multi-View Hashing (CSMVH) method to address the mentioned problems. Central similarity learning is used for solving the local similarity problem which can utilize the global similarity between the hash center and samples. We present copious empirical data demonstrating the superiority of gate-based fusion over conventional approaches. On the MS COCO and NUS-WIDE the proposed CSMVH performs better than the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (up to 11.41 mean Average Precision (mAP) improvement).</p>

	<td><p>A set of vectors S subseteq ^d is (k_1varepsilon)-clusterable if there are k_1 balls of radius varepsilon that cover S. A set of vectors S subseteq ^d is (k_2delta)-far from being clusterable if there are at least k_2 vectors in S with all pairwise distances at least delta. We propose a probabilistic algorithm to distinguish between these two cases. Our algorithm reaches a decision by only looking at the extreme values of a scalar valued hash function defined by a random field on S; hence it is especially suitable in distributed and online settings. An important feature of our method is that the algorithm is oblivious to the number of vectors in the online setting for example the algorithm stores only a constant number of scalars which is independent of the stream length. We introduce random field hash functions which are a key ingredient in our paradigm. Random field hash functions generalize locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). In addition to the LSH requirement that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nearby vectors are hashed to similar values our hash function also guarantees that the</code>hash values are (nearly) independent random variables for distant vectors. We formulate necessary conditions for the kernels which define the random fields applied to our problem as well as a measure of kernel optimality for which we provide a bound. Then we propose a method to construct kernels which approximate the optimal one.</p>

Nevertheless existing DD methods face challenges in maintaining a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. And the state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods can not expand to all deep hashing retrieval methods. In this paper we propose an efficient condensation framework that addresses these limitations by matching the feature-embedding between synthetic set and real set. Furthermore we enhance the diversity of features by incorporating the strategies of early-stage augmented models and multi-formation.

	<td><p>Searching on bipartite graphs is basal and versatile to many real-world Web applications e.g. online recommendation database retrieval and query-document searching. Given a query node the conventional approaches rely on the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the continuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity computation developing hashing techniques for graph structured data has recently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space prior work is however confronted with catastrophic performance decay. In this work we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We propose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach namely BGCH which consists of three novel and effective modules (1) adaptive graph convolutional hashing (2) latent feature dispersion and (3) Fourier serialized gradient estimation. Specifically the former two modules achieve the substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable information loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series decomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more accurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world datasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing hashing-based counterparts but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed model components contained therein.</p>

Many methods usually build the loss function from pairwise or triplet data points to capture the local similarity structure. Other existing methods construct the similarity graph and consider all points simultaneously. Auto-encoding Twin-bottleneck Hashing is one such method that dynamically builds the graph. Specifically each input data is encoded into a binary code and a continuous variable or the so-called twin bottlenecks. The similarity graph is then computed from these binary codes which get updated consistently during the training. In this work we generalize the original model into a supervised deep hashing network by incorporating the label information. In addition we examine the differences of codes structure between these two networks and consider the class imbalance problem especially in multi-labeled datasets. Experiments on three datasets yield statistically significant improvement against the original model. Results are also comparable and competitive to other supervised methods.</p>

Such vectors arise in many applications involving sparse data. They are also important in increasingly popular dataset search applications where inner product sketches are used to estimate data covariance conditional means and other quantities involving columns in unjoined tables.

	<td><p>Hashing is a common technique used in data processing with a strong impact on the time and resources spent on computation. Hashing also affects the applicability of theoretical results that often assume access to (unrealistic) uniform/fully-random hash functions. In this paper we are concerned with designing hash functions that are practical and come with strong theoretical guarantees on their performance. To this end we present tornado tabulation hashing which is simple fast and exhibits a certain full local randomness property that provably makes diverse algorithms perform almost as if (abstract) fully-random hashing was used. For example this includes classic linear probing the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet Fusy Gandouet Meunier AOFA 97 for counting distinct elements and the one-permutation hashing of Li Owen and Zhang NIPS 12 for large-scale machine learning. We also provide a very efficient solution for the classical problem of obtaining fully-random hashing on a fixed (but unknown to the hash function) set of n keys using O(n) space. As a consequence we get more efficient implementations of the splitting trick of Dietzfelbinger and Rink ICALP09 and the succinct space uniform hashing of Pagh and Pagh SICOMP08. Tornado tabulation hashing is based on a simple method to systematically break dependencies in tabulation-based hashing techniques.</p>

Among the many retrieval methods hashing methods are widely used due to their high efficiency and small storage space occupation. Fine-grained hashing is more challenging than traditional hashing problems due to the difficulties such as low inter-class variances and high intra-class variances caused by the characteristics of fine-grained images. To improve the retrieval accuracy of fine-grained hashing we propose a cascaded network to learn compact and highly semantic hash codes and introduce an attention-guided data augmentation method. We refer to this network as a cascaded hierarchical data augmentation network. We also propose a novel approach to coordinately balance the loss of multi-task learning. We do extensive experiments on some common fine-grained visual classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-art hashing methods and can effectively improve the accuracy of fine-grained retrieval.

	<td><p>Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption learning to hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However existing hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper we propose a Generalized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem which encounters two crucial bottlenecks 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains leading to an inevitable domain distribution gap; 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned bringing up an additional feature gap. To address the GITR problem we propose an Asymmetric Transfer Hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised realizations. Specifically ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile to alleviate negative transfer the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks indicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of multimodal media data on the Web in recent years hash learning methods as a way to achieve efficient and flexible cross-modal retrieval of massive multimedia data have received a lot of attention from the current Web resource retrieval research community. Existing supervised hashing methods simply transform label information into pairwise similarity information to guide hash learning leading to a potential risk of semantic error in the face of multi-label data. In addition most existing hash optimization methods solve NP-hard optimization problems by employing approximate approximation strategies based on relaxation strategies leading to a large quantization error. In order to address above obstacles we present a simple yet efficient Adaptive Asymmetric Label-guided Hashing named A2LH for Multimedia Search. Specifically A2LH is a two-step hashing method. In the first step we design an association representation model between the different modality representations and semantic label representation separately and use the semantic label representation as an intermediate bridge to solve the semantic gap existing between different modalities. In addition we present an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for solving the quantization error problem caused by relaxation-based optimization algorithms. In the second step we leverage the generated hash codes to learn the hash mapping functions. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves optimal performance on all compared baseline methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently deep cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention. However in many practical cases data are distributed and cannot be collected due to privacy concerns which greatly reduces the cross-modal hashing performance on each client. And due to the problems of statistical heterogeneity model heterogeneity and forcing each client to accept the same parameters applying federated learning to cross-modal hash learning becomes very tricky. In this paper we propose a novel method called prototype-based layered federated cross-modal hashing. Specifically the prototype is introduced to learn the similarity between instances and classes on server reducing the impact of statistical heterogeneity (non-IID) on different clients. And we monitor the distance between local and global prototypes to further improve the performance. To realize personalized federated learning a hypernetwork is deployed on server to dynamically update different layers weights of local model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Deep unsupervised hashing has been appreciated in the regime of image retrieval. However most prior arts failed to detect the semantic components and their relationships behind the images which makes them lack discriminative power. To make up the defect we propose a novel Deep Semantic Components Hashing (DSCH) which involves a common sense that an image normally contains a bunch of semantic components with homology and co-occurrence relationships. Based on this prior DSCH regards the semantic components as latent variables under the Expectation-Maximization framework and designs a two-step iterative algorithm with the objective of maximum likelihood of training data. Firstly DSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained semantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM) where an image is represented as a mixture of multiple components and the semantics co-occurrence are exploited. Besides coarse-grained semantics components are discovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained components and the hierarchy organization is then constructed. Secondly DSCH makes the images close to their semantic component centers at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels and also makes the images share similar semantic components close to each other. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical semantic components indeed facilitate the hashing model to achieve superior performance.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing is an important approach for multimodal data management and application. Existing unsupervised cross-modal hashing algorithms mainly rely on data features in pre-trained models to mine their similarity relationships. However their optimization objectives are based on the static metric between the original uni-modal features without further exploring data correlations during the training. In addition most of them mainly focus on association mining and alignment among pairwise instances in continuous space but ignore the latent structural correlations contained in the semantic hashing space. In this paper we propose an unsupervised hash learning framework namely Adaptive Structural Similarity Preservation Hashing (ASSPH) to solve the above problems. Firstly we propose an adaptive learning scheme with limited data and training batches to enrich semantic correlations of unlabeled instances during the training process and meanwhile to ensure a smooth convergence of the training process. Secondly we present an asymmetric structural semantic representation learning scheme. We introduce structural semantic metrics based on graph adjacency relations during the semantic reconstruction and correlation mining stage and meanwhile align the structure semantics in the hash space with an asymmetric binary optimization process. Finally we conduct extensive experiments to validate the enhancements of our work in comparison with existing works.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing is a successful method to solve large-scale multimedia retrieval issue. A lot of matrix factorization-based hashing methods are proposed. However the existing methods still struggle with a few problems such as how to generate the binary codes efficiently rather than directly relax them to continuity. In addition most of the existing methods choose to use an ntimes n similarity matrix for optimization which makes the memory and computation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable Cross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues. It firstly introduces a collective matrix factorization to learn a common latent space from the kernelized features of different modalities and then transforms the similarity matrix optimization to a distance-distance difference problem minimization with the help of semantic labels and common latent space. Hence the computational complexity of the ntimes n asymmetric optimization is relieved. In the generation of hash codes we also employ an orthogonal constraint of label information which is indispensable for search accuracy. So the redundancy of computation can be much reduced. For efficient optimization and scalable to large-scale datasets we adopt the two-step approach rather than optimizing simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Wiki MIRFlickr-25K and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that our ASCMH outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>

PaCHash is most naturally described as a static external hash table where it needs a constant number of bits of internal memory per block of external memory. Here in some sense PaCHash beats a lower bound on the space consumption of k-perfect hashing. An implementation for fast SSDs needs about 5 bits of internal memory per block of external memory requires only one disk access (of variable length) per search operation and has small internal search overhead compared to the disk access cost. Our experiments show that it has lower space consumption than all previous approaches even when considering objects of identical size.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years a number of online hashing methods have emerged which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples especially in the multi-label case. In this paper we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

Numerous heuristic Hamming space metric learning objectives are designed to obtain high-quality hash codes. Nevertheless a theoretical analysis of criteria for learning good hash codes remains largely unexploited. In this paper we prove that inter-class distinctiveness and intra-class compactness among hash codes determine the lower bound of hash codes performance. Promoting these two characteristics could lift the bound and improve hash learning. We then propose a surrogate model to fully exploit the above objective by estimating the posterior of hash codes and controlling it which results in a low-bias optimization. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. By testing on a series of hash-models we obtain performance improvements among all of them with an up to 26.5 increase in mean Average Precision and an up to 20.5 increase in accuracy.

	<td><p>In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies. Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary codes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes intractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to the data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization techniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low complexity.</p>

Specifically from pixels to continuous features we first propose a feature-preserving module using the corrupted image as input to reconstruct the original feature from the pre-trained ViT model and the complete image so that the feature extractor can focus on preserving the meaningful information of original data. Secondly from continuous features to hash codes we propose a hashing-preserving module which aims to keep the semantic information from the pre-trained ViT model by using the proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence loss. Besides the quantization loss and the similarity loss are added to minimize the quantization error. Our method is very simple and achieves a significantly higher degree of MAP on three benchmark image datasets.</p>

This paper improves the robustness of image copy detection with active indexing that optimizes the interplay of these two components. We reduce the quantization loss of a given image representation by making imperceptible changes to the image before its release. The loss is back-propagated through the deep neural network back to the image under perceptual constraints. These modifications make the image more retrievable.

	<td><p>Case-based Reasoning (CBR) on high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is a trending yet challenging and computationally expensive task in the real world. A promising approach is to obtain low-dimensional hash codes representing cases and perform a similarity retrieval of cases in Hamming space. However previous methods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual construction inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g. high-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data characteristics. To address these issues this work introduces a novel deep hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR. Specifically we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then we feed the case embeddings into fully-connected layers and subsequently a hash layer generates hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss during relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR we further propose an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that HeCBR greatly reduces storage and significantly accelerates case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance compared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly better than hashing-based CBR methods in classification.</p>

	<td><p>Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost performance is to employ generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However GAN-based methods are difficult to train which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation we propose a novel framework the generative cooperative hashing network which is based on energy-based cooperative learning. This framework jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function via two components a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives including probability density hash code latent code and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods achieving up to 10 relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Fast item ranking is an important task in recommender systems. In previous works graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have demonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic searching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network measures). However since these ANN approaches must go through the neural measures several times during ranking the computation is not practical if the neural measure is a large network. On the other hand fast item ranking using existing hashing-based approaches such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions. Hashing approaches however are attractive because they provide a principle and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper we propose a simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking problem that can be used for any type of measure including neural network measures. Specifically we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g. users and items) into a common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme. Then we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and contrastive samples to train the hashing model. We empirically validate the proposed method against the existing state-of-the-art fast item ranking methods in several combinations of non-linear searching functions and prominent datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is a principled approximate nearest neighbor approach to find similar items to a query in a large collection of images. Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stages continuous relaxation and the inference stages discrete quantization is important. However in the existing deep supervised hashing methods coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach substantially improves the performance of several representative hashing~methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently to improve the unsupervised image retrieval performance plenty of unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed by designing a semantic similarity matrix which is based on the similarities between image features extracted by a pre-trained CNN model. However most of these methods tend to ignore high-level abstract semantic concepts contained in images. Intuitively concepts play an important role in calculating the similarity among images. In real-world scenarios each image is associated with some concepts and the similarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical concepts. Inspired by the above intuition in this work we propose a novel Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining called UHSCM which leverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix. Specifically a set of randomly chosen concepts is first collected. Then by employing a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model with the prompt engineering which has shown strong power in visual representation learning the set of concepts is denoised according to the training images. Next the proposed method UHSCM applies the VLP model with prompting again to mine the concept distribution of each image and construct a high-quality semantic similarity matrix based on the mined concept distributions. Finally with the semantic similarity matrix as guiding information a novel hashing loss with a modified contrastive loss based regularization item is proposed to optimize the hashing network. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image retrieval task.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the continuous growth of large-scale multi-modal data and increasing requirements for retrieval speed, deep cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention recently. Most of existing studies take a similarity matrix as supervision to optimize their models, and the inner product between continuous surrogates of hash codes is utilized to depict the similarity in the Hamming space. However, all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix, ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one, i.e., the categories that samples do not belong to. Therefore, they cannot effectively alleviate the effect of dissimilar samples. Moreover, due to the modality distribution difference, directly utilizing continuous surrogates of hash codes to calculate similarity may induce suboptimal retrieval performance. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep normalized cross-modal hashing scheme with bi-direction relation reasoning, named Bi_NCMH. Specifically, we build the multi-level semantic similarity matrix by considering bi-direction relation, i.e., consistent and inconsistent relation. It hence can holistically characterize relations among instances. Besides, we execute feature normalization on continuous surrogates of hash codes to eliminate the deviation caused by modality gap, which further reduces the negative impact of binarization on retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on two cross-modal benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) aiming at searching for a set of similar items to a given query image is a very important task in remote sensing applications. Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method has achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand various deep neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images. On the other hand the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way. However with the number of database samples increasing it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of large-scale database images. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL) for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

In each stage the interactive channel transformation (ICON) module is afterwards designed to exploit correlations across channels of attended activation tensors.

This paper shows that the presence of noise removes such constrain in high-dimensions in other words sparse embeddings such as subsampling and hashing with comparable embedding dimensions to dense embeddings have similar approximate norm-preserving dimensionality-reduction properties. The key is that the noise should be treated as an information to be exploited not simply something to be removed.

	<td><p>Kterm Hashing provides an innovative approach to novelty detection on massive data streams. Previous research focused on maximizing the efficiency of Kterm Hashing and succeeded in scaling First Story Detection to Twitter-size data stream without sacrificing detection accuracy. In this paper we focus on improving the effectiveness of Kterm Hashing. Traditionally all kterms are considered as equally important when calculating a documents degree of novelty with respect to the past. We believe that certain kterms are more important than others and hypothesize that uniform kterm weights are sub-optimal for determining novelty in data streams. To validate our hypothesis we parameterize Kterm Hashing by assigning weights to kterms based on their characteristics. Our experiments apply Kterm Hashing in a First Story Detection setting and reveal that parameterized Kterm Hashing can surpass state-of-the-art detection accuracy and significantly outperform the uniformly weighted approach.</p>

	<td><p>Hierarchical semantic structures naturally existing in real-world datasets can assist in capturing the latent distribution of data to learn robust hash codes for retrieval systems. Although hierarchical semantic structures can be simply expressed by integrating semantically relevant data into a high-level taxon with coarser-grained semantics the construction embedding and exploitation of the structures remain tricky for unsupervised hash learning. To tackle these problems we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper-sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition we extend the K-Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K-Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm including hierarchical instance-wise and hierarchical prototype-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods. Codes will be released.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing has attracted much attention for binary representation learning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary codes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with similarity preservation between instances. However most existing methods learn hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local geometric structures (i.e. pairwise relationships) of data and lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To address this challenge in this work we propose an effective unsupervised method namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH) for binary representation learning. To be specific firstly we propose a novel personalized hashing module i.e. Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes for different clusters adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to the same Hamming space. In addition we deploy sparse constraints for different personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding over-fitting. Then to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise similarities in our JPSH we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash learning into the seamless formulation. As such JPSH not only distinguishes the instances from different clusters but also preserves local neighborhood structures within the cluster. Finally an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval tasks owing to efficient computation and low storage cost by encoding high-dimensional image data into binary codes. Since binary codes do not contain as much information as float features the essence of binary encoding is preserving the main context to guarantee retrieval quality. However the existing hashing methods have great limitations on suppressing redundant background information and accurately encoding from Euclidean space to Hamming space by a simple sign function. In order to solve these problems a Cross-Scale Context Extracted Hashing Network (CSCE-Net) is proposed in this paper. Firstly we design a two-branch framework to capture fine-grained local information while maintaining high-level global semantic information. Besides Attention guided Information Extraction module (AIE) is introduced between two branches which suppresses areas of low context information cooperated with global sliding windows. Unlike previous methods our CSCE-Net learns a content-related Dynamic Sign Function (DSF) to replace the original simple sign function. Therefore the proposed CSCE-Net is context-sensitive and able to perform well on accurate image binary encoding. We further demonstrate that our CSCE-Net is superior to the existing hashing methods which improves retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

In this paper we carried out in-depth investigations on metric learning in deep hashing for establishing a powerful metric space in multi-label scenarios where the pair loss suffers high computational overhead and converge difficulty while the proxy loss is theoretically incapable of expressing the profound label dependencies and exhibits conflicts in the constructed hypersphere space. To address the problems we propose a novel metric learning framework with Hybrid Proxy-Pair Loss (HyP^2 Loss) that constructs an expressive metric space with efficient training complexity w.r.t. the whole dataset. The proposed HyP^2 Loss focuses on optimizing the hypersphere space by learnable proxies and excavating data-to-data correlations of irrelevant pairs which integrates sufficient data correspondence of pair-based methods and high-efficiency of proxy-based methods. Extensive experiments on four standard multi-label benchmarks justify the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art is robust among different hash bits and achieves significant performance gains with a faster more stable convergence speed.

We introduce a novel mutual attention module to alleviate the problem of information asymmetry in network features caused by the missing image structure during contrative augmentation. Furthermore we explore the fine-grained semantic relations between images i.e. we divide the images into multiple patches and calculate similarities between patches. The aggregated weighted similarities which reflect the deep image relations are distilled to facilitate the hash codes learning with a distillation loss so as to obtain better retrieval performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed WCH significantly outperforms existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash pictures a list-wise sorting problem. Its testing metrics e.g. mean-average precision count on a sorted candidate list ordered by pair-wise code similarity. However scarcely does one train a deep hashing model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied in large-scale data retrieval due to its superior retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. However data are often scattered in data silos with privacy concerns so performing centralized data storage and retrieval is not always possible. Leveraging the concept of federated learning (FL) to perform deep hashing is a recent research trend. However existing frameworks mostly rely on the aggregation of the local deep hashing models which are trained by performing similarity learning with local skewed data only. Therefore they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a real federated environment. To overcome these challenges we propose a novel federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for each class. Globally the transmission of global prototypes with only one prototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost and privacy risk. Locally the use of global prototypes are maximized by jointly training a discriminator network and the local hashing network. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of the deep hashing model in the federated environments with non-IID data distributions.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method for scalable multi-label image search. Unlike existing approaches with conventional objectives such as contrast and triplet losses we employ a rank list rather than pairs or triplets to provide sufficient global supervision information for all the samples. Specifically a new rank-consistency objective is applied to align the similarity orders from two spaces the original space and the hamming space. A powerful loss function is designed to penalize the samples whose semantic similarity and hamming distance are mismatched in two spaces. Besides a multi-label softmax cross-entropy loss is presented to enhance the discriminative power with a concise formulation of the derivative function. In order to manipulate the neighborhood structure of the samples with different labels we design a multi-label clustering loss to cluster the hashing vectors of the samples with the same labels by reducing the distances between the samples and their multiple corresponding class centers. The state-of-the-art experimental results achieved on three public multi-label datasets MIRFLICKR-25K IAPRTC12 and NUS-WIDE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Recently deep hashing methods have been widely used in image retrieval task. Most existing deep hashing approaches adopt one-to-one quantization to reduce information loss. However such class-unrelated quantization cannot give discriminative feedback for network training. In addition these methods only utilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing function learning which may result in inferior network generalization performance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class information of data is totally ignored. In this paper we propose a dual semantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method which generates discriminative hash codes under three-fold constraints. Firstly DSAH utilizes class prior to conduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during the quantization process. Secondly a simple yet effective label mechanism is designed to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of data thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code learning. Finally a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised to minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an affinity graph. With these three main components high-quality hash codes can be generated through network. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSAH in comparison with state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Learning from set-structured data is an essential problem with many applications in machine learning and computer vision. This paper focuses on non-parametric and data-independent learning from set-structured data using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) solutions particularly locality-sensitive hashing. We consider the problem of set retrieval from an input set query. Such retrieval problem requires 1) an efficient mechanism to calculate the distances/dissimilarities between sets and 2) an appropriate data structure for fast nearest neighbor search. To that end we propose Sliced-Wasserstein set embedding as a computationally efficient set-2-vector mechanism that enables downstream ANN with theoretical guarantees. The set elements are treated as samples from an unknown underlying distribution and the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is used to compare sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm denoted as Set-LOcality Sensitive Hashing (SLOSH) on various set retrieval datasets and compare our proposed embedding with standard set embedding approaches including Generalized Mean (GeM) embedding/pooling Featurewise Sort Pooling (FSPool) and Covariance Pooling and show consistent improvement in retrieval results.

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing favored for its effectiveness and efficiency has received wide attention to facilitating efficient retrieval across different modalities. Nevertheless most existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the discriminative power of semantic information when learning the hash codes while often involving time-consuming training procedure for handling the large-scale dataset. To tackle these issues we formulate the learning of similarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic data so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming space and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH) approach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically FDDH introduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training examples to their corresponding semantic labels and utilizes -dragging technique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly the discriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and maximized. Moreover an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to map the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace which can well guarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic representation. Consequently an efficient closed form solution is derived for discriminative hash code learning which is very computationally efficient. In addition an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for optimizing modality-specific projection functions featuring adaptivity to different training sizes and streaming data. The proposed FDDH approach theoretically approximates the bi-Lipschitz continuity runs sufficiently fast and also significantly improves the retrieval performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

	<td><p>Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its computational and storage efficiency. Recently deep unsupervised hashing methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology. However most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning in which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is confronted with the following defects 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process which cannot explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the aforementioned problems we propose a Deep Self-Adaptive Hashing (DSAH) model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two special designs Adaptive Neighbor Discovery (AND) and Pairwise Information Content (PIC). Firstly we adopt the AND to initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix and then refine this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to them which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance.</p>

Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy, we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead, we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k, Nus-wide, Cifar-10, Mscoco, Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Traditional minwise hashing (MinHash) requires applying K independent permutations to estimate the Jaccard similarity in massive binary (0/1) data where K can be (e.g.) 1024 or even larger depending on applications. The recent work on C-MinHash (Li and Li 2021) has shown with rigorous proofs that only two permutations are needed. An initial permutation is applied to break whatever structures which might exist in the data and a second permutation is re-used K times to produce K hashes via a circulant shifting fashion. (Li and Li 2021) has proved that perhaps surprisingly even though the K hashes are correlated the estimation variance is strictly smaller than the variance of the traditional MinHash. It has been demonstrated in (Li and Li 2021) that the initial permutation in C-MinHash is indeed necessary. For the ease of theoretical analysis they have used two independent permutations. In this paper we show that one can actually simply use one permutation. That is one single permutation is used for both the initial pre-processing step to break the structures in the data and the circulant hashing step to generate K hashes. Although the theoretical analysis becomes very complicated we are able to explicitly write down the expression for the expectation of the estimator. The new estimator is no longer unbiased but the bias is extremely small and has essentially no impact on the estimation accuracy (mean square errors). An extensive set of experiments are provided to verify our claim for using just one permutation.</p>

In these applications embedding learning of categorical features is crucial to the success of deep learning models.

Although this method can well capture the characteristics of the categorical features and promise good performance it can incur a huge memory cost to store the embedding table especially for those web-scale applications. Such a huge memory cost significantly holds back the effectiveness and usability of EDRMs. In this paper we propose a binary code based hash embedding method which allows the size of the embedding table to be reduced in arbitrary scale without compromising too much performance.

	<td><p>In recent years, supervised hashing has been validated to greatly boost the performance of image retrieval. However, the label-hungry property requires massive label collection, making it intractable in practical scenarios. To liberate the model training procedure from laborious manual annotations, some unsupervised methods are proposed. However, the following two factors make unsupervised algorithms inferior to their supervised counterparts: (1) Without manually-defined labels, it is difficult to capture the semantic information across data, which is of crucial importance to guide robust binary code learning. (2) The widely adopted relaxation on binary constraints results in quantization error accumulation in the optimization procedure. To address the above-mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Discrete Hashing method (UDH). Specifically, to capture the semantic information, we propose a balanced graph-based semantic loss which explores the affinity priors in the original feature space. Then, we propose a novel self-supervised loss, termed orthogonal consistent loss, which can leverage semantic loss of instance and impose independence of codes. Moreover, by integrating the discrete optimization into the proposed unsupervised framework, the binary constraints are consistently preserved, alleviating the influence of quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>With the advantages of low storage cost and extremely fast retrieval speed, deep hashing methods have attracted much attention for image retrieval recently. However, large-scale face image retrieval with significant intra-class variations is still challenging. Neither existing pairwise/triplet labels-based nor softmax classification loss-based deep hashing works can generate compact and discriminative binary codes. Considering these issues, we propose a center-based framework integrating end-to-end hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. The framework minimizes the intra-class variance by clustering intra-class samples into a learnable class center. To strengthen inter-class separability, it additionally imposes a novel regularization term to enlarge the Hamming distance between pairwise class centers. Moreover, a simple yet effective regression matrix is introduced to encourage intra-class samples to generate the same binary codes, which further enhances the hashing codes compactness. Experiments on four large-scale datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under various code lengths and commonly-used evaluation metrics.</p>

	<td><p>Face image retrieval which searches for images of the same identity from the query input face image is drawing more attention as the size of the image database increases rapidly. In order to conduct fast and accurate retrieval a compact hash code-based methods have been proposed and recently deep face image hashing methods with supervised classification training have shown outstanding performance. However classification-based scheme has a disadvantage in that it cannot reveal complex similarities between face images into the hash code learning. In this paper we attempt to improve the face image retrieval quality by proposing a Similarity Guided Hashing (SGH) method which gently considers self and pairwise-similarity simultaneously. SGH employs various data augmentations designed to explore elaborate similarities between face images solving both intra and inter identity-wise difficulties. Extensive experimental results on the protocols with existing benchmarks and an additionally proposed large scale higher resolution face image dataset demonstrate that our SGH delivers state-of-the-art retrieval performance.</p>

	<td><p>In hash-based image retrieval systems degraded or transformed inputs usually generate different codes from the original deteriorating the retrieval accuracy. To mitigate this issue data augmentation can be applied during training. However even if augmented samples of an image are similar in real feature space the quantization can scatter them far away in Hamming space. This results in representation discrepancies that can impede training and degrade performance. In this work we propose a novel self-distilled hashing scheme to minimize the discrepancy while exploiting the potential of augmented data. By transferring the hash knowledge of the weakly-transformed samples to the strong ones we make the hash code insensitive to various transformations. We also introduce hash proxy-based similarity learning and binary cross entropy-based quantization loss to provide fine quality hash codes. Ultimately we construct a deep hashing framework that not only improves the existing deep hashing approaches but also achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted and confirm the effectiveness of our work.</p>

By fully exploiting label annotations they are achieving outstanding retrieval performances compared to the conventional methods. However it is painstaking to assign labels precisely for a vast amount of training data and also the annotation process is error-prone. To tackle these issues we propose the first deep unsupervised image retrieval method dubbed Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ) network which is label-free and trained in a self-supervised manner. We design a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy that jointly learns codewords and deep visual descriptors by comparing individually transformed images (views).

We proposed a novel method dubbed Cross-Modal Info-Max Hashing (CMIMH). First to learn informative representations that can preserve both intra- and inter-modal similarities we leverage the recent advances in estimating variational lower-bound of MI to maximize the MI between the binary representations and input features and between binary representations of different modalities. By jointly maximizing these MIs under the assumption that the binary representations are modelled by multivariate Bernoulli distributions we can learn binary representations which can preserve both intra- and inter-modal similarities effectively in a mini-batch manner with gradient descent. Furthermore we find out that trying to minimize the modality gap by learning similar binary representations for the same instance from different modalities could result in less informative representations. Hence balancing between reducing the modality gap and losing modality-private information is important for the cross-modal retrieval tasks. Quantitative evaluations on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by encoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient retrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning central similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data distribution. For multi-label image retrieval however previous methods only use multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the learning target which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash centers and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the above issue we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach Instance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS) to automatically learn the center weight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly we apply the maximum entropy regularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function and compute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly we update neural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center weights. More importantly the learned center weights can well reflect the proportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks and especially improves the mAP by 1.6-6.4 on the MS COCO dataset.</p>

	<td><p>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors denoted which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes compared to real-valued representations a core open challenge is how to generate hash codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small number of bits while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use representation learning for generating such hash codes focusing on neural autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than the current state of the art namely the Hamming distance and (ii) improve efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.</p>

The state of the art has primarily focused on learning hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness while assuming a brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes even though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index hashing an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH) an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing while being end-to-end trainable. In fact our proposed training objectives are model agnostic i.e. not tied to how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH and are straight-forward to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan they are still upwards of 33 slower than MISH while MISH is still able to obtain state-of-the-art effectiveness.</p>

However the existing approaches still have some limitations which need to be explored. 1) A fixed hash length (e.g. 16bits or 32bits) is predefined before learning the binary codes. Therefore these models need to be retrained when the hash length changes that consumes additional computation power reducing the scalability in practical applications. 2) Existing cross-modal approaches only explore the information in the original multimedia data to perform the hash learning without exploiting the semantic information contained in the learned hash codes. To this end we develop a novel Multiple hash cOdes jOint learNing method (MOON) for cross-media retrieval. Specifically the developed MOON synchronously learns the hash codes with multiple lengths in a unified framework. Besides to enhance the underlying discrimination we combine the clues from the multimodal data semantic labels and learned hash codes for hash learning. As far as we know the proposed MOON is the first work to simultaneously learn different length hash codes without retraining in cross-media retrieval. Experiments on several databases show that our MOON can achieve promising performance outperforming some recent competitive shallow and deep methods.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function e.g. (cdot) or (cdot) and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem Dead Bits Problem~(DBP). Besides the existing quantization loss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate DBP. Moreover we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further alleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the similarity between two images. The proposed gradient amplifier and error-aware quantization loss are compatible with a variety of deep hashing methods. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed gradient amplifier and the error-aware quantization loss.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing approaches including deep quantization and deep binary hashing have become a common solution to large-scale image retrieval due to their high computation and storage efficiency. Most existing hashing methods cannot produce satisfactory results for fine-grained retrieval because they usually adopt the outputs of the last CNN layer to generate binary codes. Since deeper layers tend to summarize visual clues e.g. texture into abstract semantics e.g. dogs and cats the feature produced by the last CNN layer is less effective in capturing subtle but discriminative visual details that mostly exist in shallow layers. To improve fine-grained image hashing we propose Pyramid Hybrid Pooling Quantization (PHPQ). Specifically we propose a Pyramid Hybrid Pooling (PHP) module to capture and preserve fine-grained semantic information from multi-level features which emphasizes the subtle discrimination of different sub-categories. Besides we propose a learnable quantization module with a partial codebook attention mechanism which helps to optimize the most relevant codewords and improves the quantization.

	<td><p>A backdoored deep hashing model is expected to behave normally on original query images and return the images with the target label when a specific trigger pattern presents. To this end we propose the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA). It injects a small number of poisoned images with the correct label into the training data which makes the attack hard to be detected. To craft the poisoned images we first propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code learning. As such the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by optimizing the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space. We then employ the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger to improve the attack performance. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CIBA.

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have been shown to be the most efficient approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for large-scale image retrieval. However existing deep hashing methods have a poor small-sample ranking performance for case-based medical image retrieval. The top-ranked images in the returned query results may be as a different class than the query image. This ranking problem is caused by classification regions of interest (ROI) and small-sample information loss in the hashing space. To address the ranking problem we propose an end-to-end framework called Attention-based Triplet Hashing (ATH) network to learn low-dimensional hash codes that preserve the classification ROI and small-sample information. We embed a spatial-attention module into the network structure of our ATH to focus on ROI information. The spatial-attention module aggregates the spatial information of feature maps by utilizing max-pooling element-wise maximum and element-wise mean operations jointly along the channel axis. The triplet cross-entropy loss can help to map the classification information of images and similarity between images into the hash codes. Extensive experiments on two case-based medical datasets demonstrate that our proposed ATH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods and boost the ranking performance for small samples. Compared to the other loss methods the triplet cross-entropy loss can enhance the classification performance and hash code-discriminability</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has shown promising performance in large-scale image retrieval. However latent codes extracted by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) will inevitably lose semantic information during the binarization process which damages the retrieval accuracy and makes it challenging. Although many existing approaches perform regularization to alleviate quantization errors we figure out an incompatible conflict between metric learning and quantization learning. The metric loss penalizes the inter-class distances to push different classes unconstrained far away. Worse still it tends to map the latent code deviate from ideal binarization point and generate severe ambiguity in the binarization process. Based on the minimum distance of the binary linear code we creatively propose Hashing-guided Hinge Function (HHF) to avoid such conflict. In detail the carefully-designed inflection point which relies on the hash bit length and category numbers is explicitly adopted to balance the metric term and quantization term. Such a modification prevents the network from falling into local metric optimal minima in deep hashing. Extensive experiments in CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 ImageNet and MS-COCO show that HHF consistently outperforms existing techniques and is robust and flexible to transplant into other methods.

	<td><p>With the quick development of social websites, there are more opportunities to have different media types (such as text, image, video, etc.) describing the same topic from large-scale heterogeneous data sources. To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval, unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However, most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result, existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article, we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function, exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence, and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem, and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki, MIRFlickr, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO). The results demonstrate that RUCMH can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, especially for the partially paired case, which validates the effectiveness of RUCMH.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing, which represents data items as compact binary codes, has
been becoming a more and more popular technique, e.g., for large-scale image retrieval, owing to its super fast search speed as well
as its extremely economical memory consumption. However, existing hashing methods all try to learn binary codes from artificially
balanced datasets which are not commonly available in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Long-Tail Hashing Network
(LTHNet), a novel two-stage deep hashing approach that addresses
the problem of learning to hash for more realistic datasets where
the data labels roughly exhibit a long-tail distribution. Specifically,
the first stage is to learn relaxed embeddings of the given dataset
with its long-tail characteristic taken into account via an end-to-end deep neural network; the second stage is to binarize those
obtained embeddings. A critical part of LTHNet is its extended dynamic meta-embedding module which can adaptively realize visual
knowledge transfer between head and tail classes, and thus enrich
image representations for hashing. Our experiments have shown
that LTHNet achieves dramatic performance improvements over all
state-of-the-art competitors on long-tail datasets, with no or little
sacrifice on balanced datasets. Further analyses reveal that while to
our surprise directly manipulating class weights in the loss function
has little effect, the extended dynamic meta-embedding module, the
usage of cross-entropy loss instead of square loss, and the relatively
small batch-size for training all contribute to LTHNet’s success.</p>

In practice many heuristic approaches exist to learn the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS crucially adapting to the structure of the given dataset. Oftentimes these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real datasets but almost always come at the cost of losing the guarantees of either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries or apply to datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper we design an NNS algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially matching that of theoretical algorithms while optimizing the hashing to the structure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on the minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithms ability to optimize for a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical side we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much better than the standard theoretical one.

	<td><p>The hashing trick is a machine learning technique used to encode categorical features into a numerical vector representation of pre-defined fixed length. It works by using the categorical hash values as vector indices and updating the vector values at those indices. Here we discuss a different approach based on additive-hashing and the almost orthogonal property of high-dimensional random vectors. That is we show that additive feature hashing can be performed directly by adding the hash values and converting them into high-dimensional numerical vectors. We show that the performance of additive feature hashing is similar to the hashing trick and we illustrate the results numerically using synthetic language recognition and SMS spam detection data.</p>

	<td><p>In light of the ability to enable efficient storage and fast query for big data, hashing techniques for cross-modal search have aroused extensive attention. Despite the great success achieved, unsupervised cross-modal hashing still suffers from lacking reliable similarity supervision and struggles with handling the heterogeneity issue between different modalities. To cope with these, in this paper, we devise a new deep hashing model, termed as High-order Nonlocal Hashing (HNH) to facilitate cross-modal retrieval with the following advantages. First, different from existing methods that mainly leverage low-level local-view similarity as the guidance for hashing learning, we propose a high-order affinity measure that considers the multi-modal neighbourhood structures from a nonlocal perspective, thereby comprehensively capturing the similarity relationships between data items. Second, a common representation is introduced to correlate different modalities. By enforcing the modal-specific descriptors and the common representation to be aligned with each other, the proposed HNH significantly bridges the modality gap and maintains the intra-consistency. Third, an effective affinity preserving objective function is delicately designed to generate high-quality binary codes. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of the proposed HNH in unsupervised cross-modal retrieval tasks over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

	<td><p>A deep hashing model typically has two main learning objectives to make the learned binary hash codes discriminative and to minimize a quantization error. With further constraints such as bit balance and code orthogonality it is not uncommon for existing models to employ a large number (4) of losses. This leads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their effectiveness. In this work we propose a novel deep hashing model with only . Specifically we show that maximizing the cosine similarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization error minimization. Further with this learning objective code balancing can be achieved by simply using a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label classification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is a one-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights of various losses. Importantly extensive experiments show that our model is highly effective outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-loss hashing models on three large-scale instance retrieval benchmarks often by significant margins.</p>

In this paper we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users everything is possible.

In this paper we give a novel end-to-end model to extract the key feature from hard examples and obtain hash code with the accurate semantic information. In addition we redesign a hard pair-wise loss function to assess the hard degree and update penalty weights of examples. It effectively alleviates the shortage problem in hard examples.

	<td><p>Machine learning on source code (MLOnCode) is a popular research field that has been driven by the availability of large-scale code repositories and the development of powerful probabilistic and deep learning models for mining source code. Code-to-code recommendation is a task in MLOnCode that aims to recommend relevant, diverse and concise code snippets that usefully extend the code currently being written by a developer in their development environment (IDE). Code-to-code recommendation engines hold the promise of increasing developer productivity by reducing context switching from the IDE and increasing code-reuse. Existing code-to-code recommendation engines do not scale gracefully to large codebases, exhibiting a linear growth in query time as the code repository increases in size. In addition, existing code-to-code recommendation engines fail to account for the global statistics of code repositories in the ranking function, such as the distribution of code snippet lengths, leading to sub-optimal retrieval results. We address both of these weaknesses with \emph{Senatus}, a new code-to-code recommendation engine. At the core of Senatus is \emph{De-Skew} LSH a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that indexes the data for fast (sub-linear time) retrieval while also counteracting the skewness in the snippet length distribution using novel abstract syntax tree-based feature scoring and selection algorithms. We evaluate Senatus via automatic evaluation and with an expert developer user study and find the recommendations to be of higher quality than competing baselines, while achieving faster search. For example, on the CodeSearchNet dataset we show that Senatus improves performance by 6.7% F1 and query time 16x is faster compared to Facebook Aroma on the task of code-to-code recommendation.</p>

However directly tackling the distance or similarity measure between images could also be efficient. To this end we revisit the idea of re-ranking the top-k retrieved images in the context of image retrieval (e.g. the k-reciprocal nearest neighbors) and generalize this idea to transductive few-shot learning. We propose to meta-learn the re-ranking updates such that the similarity graph converges towards the target similarity graph induced by the image labels. Specifically the re-ranking module takes as input an initial similarity graph between the query image and the contextual images using a pre-trained feature extractor and predicts an improved similarity graph by leveraging the structure among the involved images. We show that our re-ranking approach can be applied to unseen images and can further boost existing approaches for both image retrieval and few-shot learning problems. Our approach operates either independently or in conjunction with classical re-ranking approaches yielding clear and consistent improvements on image retrieval (CUB Cars SOP rOxford5K and rParis6K) and transductive few-shot classification (Mini-ImageNet tiered-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS) benchmarks.

Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency structures these methods rarely model the raw documents directly but instead to model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW) TFIDF). In this paper we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing their tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try we modify existing generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However little improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF features. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative hashing which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT embeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue a new unsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual information (MI) maximization principle. Specifically the method first constructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks to maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes that outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial margin.</p>

In image retrieval it is observed that the contextual similarity among the top-ranked images is an important clue to distinguish the semantic relevance. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a visual re-ranking method by contextual similarity aggregation with self-attention. In our approach for each image in the top-K ranking list we represent it into an affinity feature vector by comparing it with a set of anchor images. Then the affinity features of the top-K images are refined by aggregating the contextual information with a transformer encoder. Finally the affinity features are used to recalculate the similarity scores between the query and the top-K images for re-ranking of the latter. To further improve the robustness of our re-ranking model and enhance the performance of our method a new data augmentation scheme is designed. Since our re-ranking model is not directly involved with the visual feature used in the initial retrieval it is ready to be applied to retrieval result lists obtained from various retrieval algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed visual re-ranking method.</p>

However this requirement may force the models spending lots of their effort on reconstructing the unuseful background information while ignoring to preserve the discriminative semantic information that is more important for the hashing task. To tackle this problem inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in learning continuous representations we propose to adapt this framework to learn binary hashing codes. Specifically we first propose to modify the objective function to meet the specific requirement of hashing and then introduce a probabilistic binary representation layer into the model to facilitate end-to-end training of the entire model. We further prove the strong connection between the proposed contrastive-learning-based hashing method and the mutual information and show that the proposed model can be considered under the broader framework of the information bottleneck (IB). Under this perspective a more general hashing model is naturally obtained. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the advantage of reducing storage while speeding up query time on big heterogeneous data cross-modal hashing has been extensively studied for approximate nearest neighbor search of multi-modal data. Most hashing methods assume that training data is class-balanced.However in practice real world data often have a long-tailed distribution. In this paper we introduce a meta-learning based cross-modal hashing method (MetaCMH) to handle long-tailed data. Due to the lack of training samples in the tail classes MetaCMH first learns direct features from data in different modalities and then introduces an associative memory module to learn the memory features of samples of the tail classes. It then combines the direct and memory features to obtain meta features for each sample. For samples of the head classes of the long tail distribution the weight of the direct features is larger because there are enough training data to learn them well; while for rare classes the weight of the memory features is larger. Finally MetaCMH uses a likelihood loss function to preserve the similarity in different modalities and learns hash functions in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on long-tailed datasets show that MetaCMH performs significantly better than state-of-the-art methods especially on the tail classes.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is one of the most promising methods in cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search. Most CMH solutions ideally assume the labels of training and testing set are identical. However the assumption is often violated causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this issue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones using label attributes. However the attributes are isolated from the features of multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap we introduce an approach called LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing). LAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec model and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common subspace. Next it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix to guide the feature extraction network of different modalities. At the same time LAEH uses the attribute similarity as the supplement of label similarity to rectify the label embedding and common subspace. Experiments show that LAEH outperforms related representative zero-shot and cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

Different from existing reconstruction-based strategies we learn unsupervised binary descriptors by contrastive learning which can better capture discriminative visual semantics. Besides we uncover that codeword diversity regularization is critical to prevent contrastive learning-based quantization from model degeneration.

Thereinto hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has drawn lots of attention in recent years there still remain some problems. The first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this paper we propose a new model termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS). We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data which could help handle the new coming classes and thereby construct the enhanced semantic objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and benefiting the community our code and data are already available in supplementary material and will be made publicly available.</p>

In the proposed framework the hash functions are fixed and a parametric similarity function for the binary codes is learnt online to adapt to the streaming data. Specifically a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is adopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity function online based on the characteristics of the hashing methods.

	<td><p>Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has become a hot topic recently. Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However, current UCMH methods calculate the similarity between two data, mainly relying on the two data’s cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space, because the cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the complex data relationships, such as situations where two data have different feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper, we devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN). Specifically, DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors. DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three types of data similarities (i.e., the graph-neighbor coherence, the coexistent similarity, and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization errors during hashing. Essentially, DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity problem by exploring and exploiting the data’s intrinsic relationships in a graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN, e.g., by improving the mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit hashing codes to retrieval texts from images. We will release the source code package and the trained model on https://github.com/Atmegal/DGCPN.</p>

In this paper we present a novel retrieval method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate accurate pairwise matches without costly redundancy. We formulate image retrieval task as a node binary classification problem in graph data a node is marked as positive if it shares the scene overlaps with the query image. The key idea is that we find that the local context in feature space around a query image contains rich information about the matchable relation between this image and its neighbors. By constructing a subgraph surrounding the query image as input data we adopt a learnable GCN to exploit whether nodes in the subgraph have overlapping regions with the query photograph. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs remarkably well on the challenging dataset of highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Besides compared with state-of-the-art matchable retrieval methods the proposed approach significantly reduces useless attempted matches without sacrificing the accuracy and completeness of reconstruction.</p>

	<td><p>Image hash codes are produced by binarizing the embeddings of convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained for either classification or retrieval. While proxy embeddings achieve good performance on both tasks they are non-trivial to binarize due to a rotational ambiguity that encourages non-binary embeddings. The use of a fixed set of proxies (weights of the CNN classification layer) is proposed to eliminate this ambiguity and a procedure to design proxy sets that are nearly optimal for both classification and hashing is introduced. The resulting hash-consistent large margin (HCLM) proxies are shown to encourage saturation of hashing units thus guaranteeing a small binarization error while producing highly discriminative hash-codes. A semantic extension (sHCLM) aimed to improve hashing performance in a transfer scenario is also proposed. Extensive experiments show that sHCLM embeddings achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art hashing procedures on several small and large datasets both within and beyond the set of training classes.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal retrieval deals with retrieving relevant items from one modality when provided with a search query from another modality. Hashing techniques where the data is represented as binary bits have specifically gained importance due to the ease of storage fast computations and high accuracy. In real world the number of data categories is continuously increasing which requires algorithms capable of handling this dynamic scenario. In this work we propose a novel incremental cross-modal hashing algorithm termed iCMH which can adapt itself to handle incoming data of new categories. The proposed approach consists of two sequential stages namely learning the hash codes and training the hash functions. At every stage a small amount of old category data termed exemplars is is used so as not to forget the old data while trying to learn for the new incoming data i.e. to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

	<td><p>Recently hashing is widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for its storage and computational efficiency. Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity-preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre-trained model as the guiding information i.e. treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre-trained model many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover few of the methods consider the robustness of models which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper we propose a new method named omprehensive smilarity ining and cnsistency learing (CIMON). First we use global refinement and similarity statistical distribution to obtain reliable and smooth guidance. Second both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb-invariant and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval performance and robustness.</p>

center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers, to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept, i.e. hash center that refers to a set
of data points scattered in the Hamming space with sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash
centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli

Hashing (CSH) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. The CSH is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval demonstrate CSH can generate cohesive hash codes for similar
data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs,
and achieve noticeable boost in retrieval performance, i.e.

In this paper, we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework, the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore, inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space. The queries and the binary code database are projected asymmetrically to further improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on two multi-label image databases demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method for multi-label image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has attracted widespread attention in image retrieval because of its fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Compared with supervised methods, unsupervised hashing methods are more reasonable and suitable for large-scale image retrieval since it is always difficult and expensive to collect true labels of the massive data. Without label information, however, unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH), which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part, we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part, a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore, the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes, hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. To solve the resulting optimization problem, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based iterative algorithm is elaborately designed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale data sets indicate the promising performance of the proposed LSAH.</p>

	<td><p>Efficient hashing techniques have attracted extensive research interests in both storage and retrieval of high dimensional data, such as images and videos. In existing hashing methods, a linear model is commonly utilized owing to its efficiency. To obtain better accuracy, linear-based hashing methods focus on designing a generalized linear objective function with different constraints or penalty terms that consider the inherent characteristics and neighborhood information of samples. Differing from existing hashing methods, in this study, we propose a self-improvement framework called Model Boost (MoBoost) to improve model parameter optimization for linear-based hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed MoBoost, for a linear-based hashing method, we first repeatedly execute the hashing method to obtain several hash codes to training samples. Then, utilizing two novel fusion strategies, these codes are fused into a single set. We also propose two new criteria to evaluate the goodness of hash bits during the fusion process. Based on the fused set of hash codes, we learn new parameters for the linear hash function that can significantly improve the accuracy. In general, the proposed MoBoost can be adopted by existing linear-based hashing methods, achieving more precise and stable performance compared to the original methods, and adopting the proposed MoBoost will incur negligible time and space costs. To evaluate the proposed MoBoost, we performed extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance.</p>

Recent unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods have shown promising results. However, existing approaches typically suffer from two limitations: (1) They usually learn cross-modal similarity information separately or in a redundant fusion manner, which may fail to capture semantic correlations among instances from different modalities sufficiently and effectively. (2) They seldom consider the sampling and weighting schemes for unsupervised cross-modal hashing, resulting in the lack of satisfactory discriminative ability in hash codes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing method called Joint-modal Distribution-based Similarity Hashing (JDSH) for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we propose a novel cross-modal joint-training method by constructing a joint-modal similarity matrix to fully preserve the cross-modal semantic correlations among instances. Secondly, we propose a sampling and weighting scheme termed the Distribution-based Similarity Decision and Weighting (DSDW) method for unsupervised cross-modal hashing, which is able to generate more discriminative hash codes by pushing semantic similar instance pairs closer and pulling semantic dissimilar instance pairs apart. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of JDSH compared with several unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods on two public datasets NUS-WIDE and MIRFlickr.</p>

However large-scale high-speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash learning field and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view hashing methods.</p>

Unlike most existing deep hashing methods which use a series of convolution and fully-connected layers to learn binary features, we develop a probabilistic framework to infer latent feature representation inside the network. Then, we design a struct layer rather than a bottleneck hash layer, to obtain binary codes through a simple encoding procedure. By doing these, we are able to obtain binary codes discriminatively and generatively. To make it applicable to cross-modal scalable multimedia retrieval, we extend our method to a cross-modal deep variational and structural hashing (CM-DVStH). We design a deep fusion network with a struct layer to maximize the correlation between image-text input pairs during the training stage so that a unified binary vector can be obtained. We then design modality-specific hashing networks to handle the out-of-sample extension scenario. Specifically, we train a network for each modality which outputs a latent representation that is as close as possible to the binary codes which are inferred from the fusion network. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

To this end most existing works exploit this problem under a supervised setting i.e. using class labels to boost the hashing performance which suffers from the defects in both adaptivity and efficiency First large amounts of training batches are required to learn up-to-date hash functions which leads to poor online adaptivity. Second the training is time-consuming which contradicts with the core need of online learning. In this paper a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed Fast Class-wise Updating for Online Hashing (FCOH) is proposed to address the above two challenges by introducing a novel and efficient inner product operation. To achieve fast online adaptivity a class-wise updating method is developed to decompose the binary code learning and alternatively renew the hash functions in a class-wise fashion which well addresses the burden on large amounts of training batches. Quantitatively such a decomposition further leads to at least 75 storage saving. To further achieve online efficiency we propose a semi-relaxation optimization which accelerates the online training by treating different binary constraints independently. Without additional constraints and variables the time complexity is significantly reduced. Such a scheme is also quantitatively shown to well preserve past information during updating hashing functions. We have quantitatively demonstrated that the collective effort of class-wise updating and semi-relaxation optimization provides a superior performance comparing to various state-of-the-art methods which is verified through extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets.</p>

Motivated by this we present a Task-adaptive Asymmetric Deep Cross-modal Hashing (TA-ADCMH) method in this paper. It can learn task-adaptive hash functions for two sub-retrieval tasks via simultaneous modality representation and asymmetric hash learning. Unlike previous cross-modal hashing approaches our learning framework jointly optimizes semantic preserving that transforms deep features of multimedia data into binary hash codes and the semantic regression which directly regresses query modality representation to explicit label. With our model the binary codes can effectively preserve semantic correlations across different modalities meanwhile adaptively capture the query semantics. The superiority of TA-ADCMH is proved on two standard datasets from many aspects.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed hashing has been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically by using one hash code to represent one image existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper we propose a novel hashing framework called multiple code hashing (MCH) to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash bucket search compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for each image.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years, cross-media retrieval has drawn considerable attention due to the exponential growth of multimedia data. Many hashing approaches have been proposed for the cross-media search task. However, there are still open problems that warrant investigation. For example, most existing supervised hashing approaches employ a binary label matrix, which achieves small margins between wrong labels (0) and true labels (1). This may affect the retrieval performance by generating many false negatives and false positives. In addition, some methods adopt a relaxation scheme to solve the binary constraints, which may cause large quantization errors. There are also some discrete hashing methods that have been presented, but most of them are time-consuming. To conquer these problems, we present a label relaxation and discrete matrix factorization method (LRMF) for cross-modal retrieval. It offers a number of innovations. First of all, the proposed approach employs a novel label relaxation scheme to control the margins adaptively, which has the benefit of reducing the quantization error. Second, by virtue of the proposed discrete matrix factorization method designed to learn the binary codes, large quantization errors caused by relaxation can be avoided. The experimental results obtained on two widely-used databases demonstrate that LRMF outperforms state-of-the-art cross-media methods.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing is important for indexing huge image or video collections without having expensive annotations available. Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k Nus-wide Cifar-10 Mscoco Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Fast image retrieval is of great importance in many computer vision tasks and especially practical applications. Deep hashing, the state-of-the-art fast image retrieval scheme, introduces deep learning to learn the hash functions and generate binary hash codes, and outperforms the other image retrieval methods in terms of accuracy. However, all the existing deep hashing methods could only generate one level hash codes and require a linear traversal of all the hash codes to figure out the closest one when a new query arrives, which is very time-consuming and even intractable for large scale applications. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Hashing(HDHash) scheme to speed up the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. More specifically, hierarchical deep hash codes of multiple levels can be generated and indexed with tree structures rather than linear ones, and pruning irrelevant branches can sharply decrease the retrieval time. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to introduce hierarchical indexed deep hashing for fast large scale image retrieval. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HDHash scheme achieves better or comparable accuracy with significantly improved efficiency and reduced memory as compared to state-of- the-art fast image retrieval schemes.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid development of social websites recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of social images with user-provided tags which continuously arrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing attention. However existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are based on batch mode which violates the nature of social images i.e. social images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion. Although there exist many online image hashing methods they either adopt unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags or are designed in the supervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper to overcome the above limitations we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online Hashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes WOH exploits the weak supervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise. Besides We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH which is efficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several state-of-the-art hashing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the superiority in similarity computation and database storage for large-scale multiple modalities data cross-modal hashing methods have attracted extensive attention in similarity retrieval across the heterogeneous modalities. However there are still some limitations to be further taken into account (1) most current CMH methods transform real-valued data points into discrete compact binary codes under the binary constraints limiting the capability of representation for original data on account of abundant loss of information and producing suboptimal hash codes; (2) the discrete binary constraint learning model is hard to solve where the retrieval performance may greatly reduce by relaxing the binary constraints for large quantization error; (3) handling the learning problem of CMH in a symmetric framework leading to difficult and complex optimization objective. To address above challenges in this paper a novel Asymmetric Correlation Quantization Hashing (ACQH) method is proposed. Specifically ACQH learns the projection matrixs of heterogeneous modalities data points for transforming query into a low-dimensional real-valued vector in latent semantic space and constructs the stacked compositional quantization embedding in a coarse-to-fine manner for indicating database points by a series of learnt real-valued codeword in the codebook with the help of pointwise label information regression simultaneously. Besides the unified hash codes across modalities can be directly obtained by the discrete iterative optimization framework devised in the paper. Comprehensive experiments on diverse three benchmark datasets have shown the effectiveness and rationality of ACQH.</p>

The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data, which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However, existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes, leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides, most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method, named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images, first, the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second, we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones, we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets.</p>

In the first step we propose a novel spectral embedding-based algorithm to simultaneously learn single-modality and binary cross-modality representations. While the former is capable of well preserving the local structure of each modality the latter reveals the hidden patterns from all modalities. In the second step to learn mapping functions from informative data inputs (images and word embeddings) to binary codes obtained from the first step we leverage the powerful CNN for images and propose a CNN-based deep architecture to learn text modality. Quantitative evaluations on three standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DCSH method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>The objective of this work is to learn a compact embedding of a set of descriptors that is suitable for efficient retrieval and ranking whilst maintaining discriminability of the individual descriptors. We focus on a specific example of this general problem – that of retrieving images containing multiple faces from a large scale dataset of images. Here the set consists of the face descriptors in each image and given a query for multiple identities the goal is then to retrieve in order images which contain all the identities all but one etc To this end we make the following contributions first we propose a CNN architecture – em SetNet – to achieve the objective it learns face descriptors and their aggregation over a set to produce a compact fixed length descriptor designed for set retrieval and the score of an image is a count of the number of identities that match the query; second we show that this compact descriptor has minimal loss of discriminability up to two faces per image and degrades slowly after that – far exceeding a number of baselines; third we explore the speed vs. retrieval quality trade-off for set retrieval using this compact descriptor; and finally we collect and annotate a large dataset of images containing various number of celebrities which we use for evaluation and is publicly released.</p>

	<td><p>This paper presents a method for large-scale retrieval of piano sheet music images. Our work differs from previous studies on sheet music retrieval in two ways. First we investigate the problem at a much larger scale than previous studies using all solo piano sheet music images in the entire IMSLP dataset as a searchable database. Second we use cell phone images of sheet music as our input queries which lends itself to a practical user-facing application. We show that a previously proposed fingerprinting method for sheet music retrieval is far too slow for a real-time application and we diagnose its shortcomings. We propose a novel hashing scheme called dynamic n-gram fingerprinting that significantly reduces runtime while simultaneously boosting retrieval accuracy. In experiments on IMSLP data our proposed method achieves a mean reciprocal rank of 0.85 and an average runtime of 0.98 seconds per query.</p>

	<td><p>In the era of big data methods for improving memory and computational efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies. Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary codes. However due to binary constraints the optimization becomes intractable. To mitigate this challenge different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore instead of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to the data points we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization techniques namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold to obtain the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets we show that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low complexity.</p>

We extend this method to our novel Set-query LSH (SLSH) such that it can find the nearest neighbors of a set of points given as a query. Let s(xy) be the similarity between two points x and y . We define a similarity between a set Q and a point x by aggregating the similarities s(px) for all pin Q . For example we can take s(px) to be the angular similarity between p and x (i.e. 1-angle (xp)/pi) and aggregate by arithmetic or geometric averaging or taking the lowest similarity. We develop locality sensitive hash families and data structures for a large set of such arithmetic and geometric averaging similarities and analyze their collision probabilities. We also establish an analogous framework and hash families for distance functions. Specifically we give a structure for the euclidean distance aggregated by either averaging or taking the maximum. We leverage SLSH to solve a geometric extension of the approximate near neighbors problem. In this version we consider a metric for which the unit ball is an ellipsoid and its orientation is specified with the query. An important application that motivates our work is group recommendation systems. Such a system embeds movies and users in the same feature space and the task of recommending a movie for a group to watch together translates to a set-query Q using an appropriate similarity.</p>

The notion of node symmetry is made precise via computation of vertex orbits and the graph automorphism group and nodes that are symmetrically identical are assigned equal hashes. We also present a novel Merkle-style hashing algorithm that seeks to fulfill the recursive principle that a hash of a node should depend only on the hash of its neighbors. This algorithm works even in the presence of cycles which would not be possible with a naive approach. Structurally hashing trees has seen widespread use in blockchain source code version control and web applications.

Inspired by this we present Semantic Hashing with Pairwise Reconstruction (PairRec) which is a discrete variational autoencoder based hashing model. PairRec first encodes weakly supervised training pairs (a query document and a semantically similar document) into two hash codes and then learns to reconstruct the same query document from both of these hash codes (i.e. pairwise reconstruction). This pairwise reconstruction enables our model to encode local neighbourhood structures within the hash code directly through the decoder. We experimentally compare PairRec to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches and obtain significant performance improvements in the task of document similarity search.</p>

	<td><p>Node classification in structural networks has been proven to be useful in many real world applications. With the development of network embedding the performance of node classification has been greatly improved. However nearly all the existing network embedding based methods are hard to capture the actual category features of a node because of the linearly inseparable problem in low-dimensional space; meanwhile they cannot incorporate simultaneously network structure information and node label information into network embedding. To address the above problems in this paper we propose a novel Deep Kernel Supervised Hashing (DKSH) method to learn the hashing representations of nodes for node classification. Specifically a deep multiple kernel learning is first proposed to map nodes into suitable Hilbert space to deal with linearly inseparable problem. Then instead of only considering structural similarity between two nodes a novel similarity matrix is designed to merge both network structure information and node label information. Supervised by the similarity matrix the learned hashing representations of nodes simultaneously preserve the two kinds of information well from the learned Hilbert space. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines over three real world benchmark datasets.</p>

disclosed in this paper, brings about the following methodological improvements: (a) we may directly employ the proposed differentiable polarization loss with no large deviations incurred from
the target Hamming distance based loss; and (b) the subtask of assigning binary codes becomes extremely simple — even random codes assigned to each class suffice to result in state-of-the-art performances, as demonstrated in CIFAR10, NUS-WIDE and ImageNet100 datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Weighted Hamming distance as a similarity measure between binary codes and binary queries provides superior accuracy in search tasks than Hamming distance. However how to efficiently and accurately find K binary codes that have the smallest weighted Hamming distance to the query remains an open issue. In this paper a fast search algorithm is proposed to perform the non-exhaustive search for K nearest binary codes by weighted Hamming distance. By using binary codes as direct bucket indices in a hash table the search algorithm generates a sequence to probe the buckets based on the independence characteristic of the weights for each bit. Furthermore a fast search framework based on the proposed search algorithm is designed to solve the problem of long binary codes. Specifically long binary codes are split into substrings and multiple hash tables are built on them. Then the search algorithm probes the buckets to obtain candidates according to the generated substring indices and a merging algorithm is proposed to find the nearest binary codes by merging the candidates. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the search algorithm improves the search accuracy compared to other non-exhaustive algorithms and provides orders-of-magnitude faster search than the linear scan baseline.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing techniques have recently been successfully applied to solve similarity search problems in the information retrieval field because of their significantly reduced storage and high-speed search capabilities. However, the hash codes learned from most recent cross-modal hashing methods lack the ability to comprehensively preserve adequate information, resulting in a less than desirable performance. To solve this limitation, we propose a novel method termed Nonlinear Robust Discrete Hashing (NRDH), for cross-modal retrieval. The main idea behind NRDH is motivated by the success of neural networks, i.e., nonlinear descriptors, in the field of representation learning, and the use of nonlinear descriptors instead of simple linear transformations is more in line with the complex relationships that exist between common latent representation and heterogeneous multimedia data in the real world. In NRDH, we first learn a common latent representation through nonlinear descriptors to encode complementary and consistent information from the features of the heterogeneous multimedia data. Moreover, an asymmetric learning scheme is proposed to correlate the learned hash codes with the common latent representation. Empirically, we demonstrate that NRDH is able to successfully generate a comprehensive common latent representation that significantly improves the quality of the learned hash codes. Then, NRDH adopts a linear learning strategy to fast learn the hash function with the learned hash codes. Extensive experiments performed on two benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of NRDH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

However perceptual image hashing algorithms are differentiable and are thus vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that not only is it possible to modify an image to produce an unrelated hash but an exact image hash collision between a source and target image can be produced via minuscule adversarial perturbations. In a white box setting these collisions can be replicated across nearly every image pair and hash type (including both deep and non-learned hashes). Furthermore by attacking points other than the output of a hashing function an attacker can avoid having to know the details of a particular algorithm resulting in collisions that transfer across different hash sizes or model architectures. Using these techniques an adversary can poison the image lookup table of a duplicate image detection service resulting in undefined or unwanted behavior. Finally we offer several potential mitigations to gradient-based image hash attacks.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is one of the fundamental problems that demand both efficient and effective solutions for various practical scenarios. Adversarial autoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust locality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash codes. However the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be employed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically they require an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash codes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper we show that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal retrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this challenge we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically by exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional discrete space our method efficiently estimates a better variant of Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional Wasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude better sample complexity thus better generalization property compared to the other adversarial hashing methods. In addition the computational cost is significantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing methods achieving up to 10 improvement over the current state-of-the-art image hashing methods. The code accompanying this paper is available on Github (httpsgithub.com/khoadoan/adversarial-hashing).</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search due to its storage and search efficiency. Recent supervised hashing research has shown that deep learning-based methods can significantly outperform nondeep methods. Most existing supervised deep hashing methods exploit supervisory signals to generate similar and dissimilar image pairs for training. However, natural images can have large intraclass and small interclass variations, which may degrade the accuracy of hash codes. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stream ConvNet architecture, which learns hash codes with class-specific representation centers. Our basic idea is that if we can learn a unified binary representation for each class as a center and encourage hash codes of images to be close to the corresponding centers, the intraclass variation will be greatly reduced. Accordingly, we design a neural network that leverages label information and outputs a unified binary representation for each class. Moreover, we also design an image network to learn hash codes from images and force these hash codes to be close to the corresponding class-specific centers. These two neural networks are then seamlessly incorporated to create a unified, end-to-end trainable framework. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks corroborate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we study the novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for fine-grained images leveraging the search and storage efficiency of hash learning to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints it can firstly obtain both local and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects respectively. Furthermore to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meanings consistency of these part-level features across images we design a local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments our proposal consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets which shows our effectiveness. Moreover compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction revealing its efficiency and practicality.</p>

We propose a pairwise loss function with discrete latent VAE to reward within-class similarity and between-class dissimilarity for supervised hashing. Instead of solving the optimization relying on existing biased gradient estimators an unbiased low-variance gradient estimator is adopted to optimize the hashing function by evaluating the non-differentiable loss function over two correlated sets of binary hashing codes to control the variance of gradient estimates.

Third the lack of labeled data hinders the improvement of the model performance. To address these difficulties we utilize online sketching hashing (OSH) and present a FasteR Online Sketching Hashing (FROSH) algorithm to sketch the data in a more compact form via an independent transformation. We provide theoretical justification to guarantee that our proposed FROSH consumes less time and achieves a comparable sketching precision under the same memory cost of OSH. We also extend FROSH to its distributed implementation namely DFROSH to further reduce the training time cost of FROSH while deriving the theoretical bound of the sketching precision.

	<td><p>Due to the exponential growth of multimedia data, multi-modal hashing as a promising technique to make cross-view retrieval scalable is attracting more and more attention. However, most of the existing multi-modal hashing methods either divide the learning process unnaturally into two separate stages or treat the discrete optimization problem simplistically as a continuous one, which leads to suboptimal results. Recently, a few discrete multi-modal hashing methods that try to address such issues have emerged, but they still ignore several important discrete constraints (such as the balance and decorrelation of hash bits). In this paper, we overcome those limitations by proposing a novel method named “Enhanced Discrete Multi-modal Hashing (EDMH)” which learns binary codes and hashing functions simultaneously from the pairwise similarity matrix of data, under the aforementioned discrete constraints. Although the model of EDMH looks a lot more complex than the other models for multi-modal hashing, we are actually able to develop a fast iterative learning algorithm for it, since the subproblems of its optimization all have closed-form solutions after introducing two auxiliary variables. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets have demonstrated that EDMH not only performs much better than state-of-the-art competitors but also runs much faster than them.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash is a fundamental technique widely used in large-scale image retrieval. Most existing methods for learning to hash address the involved discrete optimization problem by the continuous relaxation of the binary constraint, which usually leads to large quantization errors and consequently suboptimal binary codes. A few discrete hashing methods have emerged recently. However, they either completely ignore some useful constraints (specifically the balance and decorrelation of hash bits) or just turn those constraints into regularizers that would make the optimization easier but less accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method named Strongly Constrained Discrete Hashing (SCDH) which overcomes such limitations. It can learn the binary codes for all examples in the training set, and meanwhile obtain a hash function for unseen samples with the above mentioned constraints preserved. Although the model of SCDH is fairly sophisticated, we are able to find closed-form solutions to all of its optimization subproblems and thus design an efficient algorithm that converges quickly. In addition, we extend SCDH to a kernelized version SCDH K . Our experiments on three large benchmark datasets have demonstrated that not only can SCDH and SCDH K achieve substantially higher MAP scores than state-of-the-art baselines, but they train much faster than those that are also supervised as well.</p>

Traditional approaches involving neural networks for image retrieval tasks tend to use higher layers for feature extraction. But it has been seen that the activations of lower layers have proven to be more effective in a number of scenarios. In our approach we have leveraged the use of local deep convolutional neural networks which combines the powers of both the features of lower and higher layers for creating feature maps which are then compressed using PCA and fed to a bloom filter after binary sequencing using a modified multi k-means approach. The feature maps obtained are further used in the image retrieval process in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner by first comparing the images in the higher layers for semantically similar images and then gradually moving towards the lower layers searching for structural similarities. While searching the neural hashes for the query image are again calculated and queried in the bloom filter which tells us whether the query image is absent in the set or maybe present. If the bloom filter doesnt necessarily rule out the query then it goes into the image retrieval process. This approach can be particularly helpful in cases where the image store is distributed since the approach supports parallel querying.</p>

However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods learn hash functions in a batch-based learning mode. Such mode is not suitable for large-scale data sets due to the large memory consumption and loses its efficiency when training streaming data. Online cross-modal hashing can deal with the above problems by learning hash model in an online learning process. However, existing online cross-modal hashing methods cannot update hash codes of old data by the newly learned model. In this paper, we propose Online Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (OCMFH) based on collective matrix factorization hashing (CMFH), which can adaptively update hash codes of old data according to dynamic changes of hash model without accessing to old data. Specifically, it learns discriminative hash codes for streaming data by collective matrix factorization in an online optimization scheme. Unlike conventional CMFH which needs to load the entire data points into memory, the proposed OCMFH retrains hash functions only by newly arriving data points. Meanwhile, it generates hash codes of new data and updates hash codes of old data by the latest updated hash model. In such way, hash codes of new data and old data are well-matched. Furthermore, a zero mean strategy is developed to solve the mean-varying problem in the online hash learning process. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMFH on online cross-media retrieval.</p>

Recently, many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve, most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps: projection and quantization. In the quantization step, binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However, the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required, such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step, in this paper, we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others, and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally, the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks, which is also efficient. We conduct experiments on three public benchmarks containing up to one million descriptors and show that the proposed DAQ method consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art quantization methods.</p>

Deep hashing is an efficient indexing technique to support large-scale social image retrieval due to its deep representation capability fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Particularly unsupervised deep hashing has well scalability as it does not require any manually labelled data for training. However owing to the lacking of label guidance existing methods suffer from severe semantic shortage when optimizing a large amount of deep neural network parameters. Differently in this paper we propose a Dual-level Semantic Transfer Deep Hashing (DSTDH) method to alleviate this problem with a unified deep hash learning framework. Our model targets at learning the semantically enhanced deep hash codes by specially exploiting the user-generated tags associated with the social images. Specifically we design a complementary dual-level semantic transfer mechanism to efficiently discover the potential semantics of tags and seamlessly transfer them into binary hash codes. On the one hand instance-level semantics are directly preserved into hash codes from the associated tags with adverse noise removing. Besides an image-concept hypergraph is constructed for indirectly transferring the latent high-order semantic correlations of images and tags into hash codes. Moreover the hash codes are obtained simultaneously with the deep representation learning by the discrete hash optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on two public social image retrieval datasets validate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Then we design a novel component-voting scheme to obtain an anchor code as the representative of the set of hash codes of objects with the target label, whose optimality guarantee is also theoretically derived. To balance the performance and perceptibility, we propose to minimize the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the anchor code under the ℓ∞ restriction on the perturbation. Extensive experiments verify that DHTA is effective in attacking both deep hashing based image retrieval and video retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash is an efficient paradigm for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search from massive databases. Binary hash codes are typically extracted from an image by rounding output features from a CNN which is trained on a supervised binary similar/ dissimilar task. Drawbacks of this approach are (i) resulting codes do not necessarily capture semantic similarity of the input data (ii) rounding results in information loss manifesting as decreased retrieval performance and (iii) Using only class-wise similarity as a target can lead to trivial solutions simply encoding classifier outputs rather than learning more intricate relations which is not detected by most performance metrics. We overcome (i) via a novel loss function encouraging the relative hash code distances of learned features to match those derived from their targets. We address (ii) via a differentiable estimate of the KL divergence between network outputs and a binary target distribution resulting in minimal information loss when the features are rounded to binary. Finally we resolve (iii) by focusing on a hierarchical precision metric. Efficiency of the methods is demonstrated with semantic image retrieval on the CIFAR-100 ImageNet and Conceptual Captions datasets using similarities inferred from the WordNet label hierarchy or sentence embeddings.</p>

	<td><p>Existing data-dependent hashing methods usually learn hash functions from pairwise or triplet data relationships, which only capture the data similarity locally, and often suffer from low learning efficiency and low collision rate. In this work, we propose a new global similarity metric, termed as central similarity, with which the hash codes of similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers, to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept, i.e., hash center that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally, we propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs, achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval performance, i.e. 3%-20% in mAP over the previous state-of-the-arts.</p>

	<td><p>Conventional unsupervised hashing methods usually take advantage of similarity graphs, which are either pre-computed in the high-dimensional space or obtained from random anchor points. On the one hand, existing methods uncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On the other hand, graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce biased prior knowledge of data relevance, leading to sub-optimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing an efficient and adaptive code-driven graph, which is updated by decoding in the context of an auto-encoder. Specifically, we introduce into our framework twin bottlenecks (i.e., latent variables) that exchange crucial information collaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e., binary codes) conveys the high-level intrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e., continuous variables for low-level detail information), which in turn propagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more discriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally rewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover, the proposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating the binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its effectivity and efficiency deep hashing approaches are widely used for large-scale visual search. However it is still challenging to produce compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple semantics for two main reasons 1) similarity constraints designed in most of the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity assignment(i.e. 0 for instance pairs sharing no label 1 for instance pairs sharing at least 1 label) 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for the semantics of the given dataset which efficiently and precisely guides a feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries a new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity searching and robust hash code generation. Extensive empirical research on four popular benchmarks validates the proposed method and shows it outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

The emergence of heterogeneous memory (HM) brings a solution to significantly increase memory capacity and break the above tradeoff Using HM billions of data points can be placed in the main memory on a single machine without using any data compression. However HM consists of both fast (but small) memory and slow (but large) memory and using HM inappropriately slows down query significantly. In this work we present a novel graph-based similarity search algorithm called HM-ANN which takes both memory and data heterogeneity into consideration and enables billion-scale similarity search on a single node without using compression. On two billion-sized datasets BIGANN and DEEP1B HM-ANN outperforms state-of-the-art compression-based solutions such as LC and IMI+OPQ in recall-vs-latency by a large margin obtaining 46 higher recall under the same search latency. We also extend existing graph-based methods such as HNSW and NSG with two strong baseline implementations on HM. At billion-point scale HM-ANN is 2X and 5.8X faster than our HNSWand NSG baselines respectively to reach the same accuracy.</p>

	<td><p>Deep representation learning has become one of the most widely adopted approaches for visual search recommendation and identification. Retrieval of such representations from a large database is however computationally challenging. Approximate methods based on learning compact representations have been widely explored for this problem such as locality sensitive hashing product quantization and PCA. In this work in contrast to learning compact representations we propose to learn high dimensional and sparse representations that have similar representational capacity as dense embeddings while being more efficient due to sparse matrix multiplication operations which can be much faster than dense multiplication. Following the key insight that the number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of embeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across dimensions we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse embeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that directly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval. Our experiments show that our approach is competitive to the other baselines and yields a similar or better speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff on practical datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques the entire model can be optimized efficiently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code our model can achieve significant performance gains.</p>

	<td><p>Graph representation learning has attracted much attention in supporting high quality candidate search at scale. Despite its effectiveness in learning embedding vectors for objects in the user-item interaction network the computational costs to infer users preferences in continuous embedding space are tremendous. In this work we investigate the problem of hashing with graph neural networks (GNNs) for high quality retrieval and propose a simple yet effective discrete representation learning framework to jointly learn continuous and discrete codes. Specifically a deep hashing with GNNs (HashGNN) is presented which consists of two components a GNN encoder for learning node representations and a hash layer for encoding representations to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two losses i.e. reconstruction loss from reconstructing observed links and ranking loss from preserving the relative ordering of hash codes. A novel discrete optimization strategy based on straight through estimator (STE) with guidance is proposed. The principal idea is to avoid gradient magnification in back-propagation of STE with continuous embedding guidance in which we begin from learning an easier network that mimic the continuous embedding and let it evolve during the training until it finally goes back to STE. Comprehensive experiments over three publicly available and one real-world Alibaba company datasets demonstrate that our model not only can achieve comparable performance compared with its continuous counterpart but also runs multiple times faster during inference.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing facilitates mapping of heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space which can beutilized for fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. In this paper we propose a novel cross-modal hashingarchitecture-deep neural decoder cross-modal hashing (DNDCMH) which uses a binary vector specifying the presence of certainfacial attributes as an input query to retrieve relevant face images from a database. The DNDCMH network consists of two separatecomponents an attribute-based deep cross-modal hashing (ADCMH) module which uses a margin (m)-based loss function toefficiently learn compact binary codes to preserve similarity between modalities in the Hamming space and a neural error correctingdecoder (NECD) which is an error correcting decoder implemented with a neural network. The goal of NECD network in DNDCMH isto error correct the hash codes generated by ADCMH to improve the retrieval efficiency. The NECD network is trained such that it hasan error correcting capability greater than or equal to the margin (m) of the margin-based loss function. This results in NECD cancorrect the corrupted hash codes generated by ADCMH up to the Hamming distance of m. We have evaluated and comparedDNDCMH with state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods on standard datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

	<td><p>Due to their high retrieval efficiency and low storage cost for cross-modal search task cross-modal hashing methods have attracted considerable attention. For the supervised cross-modal hashing methods how to make the learned hash codes preserve semantic information sufficiently contained in the label of datapoints is the key to further enhance the retrieval performance. Hence almost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depends on defining a similarity between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing model learning fully or partly. However the defined similarity between datapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and misses abundant semantic information then hinders the further improvement of retrieval performance. Thus in this paper different from previous works we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity between datapoints called Deep Cross-modal Hashing via (DCHML). Specifically DCHML first trains a proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset into a semantic discriminative hash code called proxy hash code. Each proxy hash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category well. Next without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the training process of the modality-specific hashing networks we propose a novel to directly utilize the proxy hashing codes as supervised information. Finally by minimizing the novel the modality-specific hashing networks can be trained to generate hash codes which can simultaneously preserve the cross-modal similarity and abundant semantic information well.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing method maps similar high-dimensional data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance and it has received broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. Pairwise similarity is easily obtained and widely used for retrieval and most supervised hashing algorithms are carefully designed for the pairwise supervisions. As labeling all data pairs is difficult semi-supervised hashing is proposed which aims at learning efficient codes with limited labeled pairs and abundant unlabeled ones. Existing methods build graphs to capture the structure of dataset but they are not working well for complex data as the graph is built based on the data representations and determining the representations of complex data is difficult. In this paper we propose a novel teacher-student semi-supervised hashing framework in which the student is trained with the pairwise information produced by the teacher network. The network follows the smoothness assumption which achieves consistent distances for similar data pairs so that the retrieval results are similar for neighborhood queries. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method reaches impressive gain over the supervised baselines and is superior to state-of-the-art semi-supervised hashing methods.</p>

Particularly cross-modal retrieval that searches across different modalities becomes an active but challenging problem. Although dozens of cross-modal hashing algorithms are proposed to yield compact binary codes the exhaustive search is impractical for the real-time purpose and Hamming distance computation suffers inaccurate results. In this paper we propose a novel search method that utilizes a probability-based index scheme over binary hash codes in cross-modal retrieval. The proposed hash code indexing scheme exploits a few binary bits of the hash code as the index code. We construct an inverted index table based on index codes and train a neural network to improve the indexing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets for retrieval across image and text modalities where hash codes are generated by three cross-modal hashing methods. Results show the proposed method effectively boost the performance on these hash methods.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing can desirably support scalable content-based image retrieval (SCBIR) for its appealing advantages of semantic label independence memory and search efficiency. However the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem in this paper we propose a novel hashing approach dubbed as (DSTH). The key idea is to augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss we explicitly impose the discrete constraint bit–uncorrelation constraint and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

To address this issue, we propose a novel variable-length quantization (VLQ) strategy for hashing. In the proposed VLQ technique, we divide all samples into different regions in each dimension firstly given the real-valued features of samples. Then we compute the dispersion degrees of these regions. Subsequently, we attempt to optimally assign different number of bits to each dimensions to obtain the minimum dispersion degree.

We propose a cross-modal quantization approach which is among the early attempts to introduce quantization into cross-modal search. The major contribution lies in jointly learning the quantizers for both modalities through aligning the quantized representations for each pair of image and text belonging to a document. In addition our approach simultaneously learns the common space for both modalities in which quantization is conducted to enable efficient and effective search using the Euclidean distance computed in the common space with fast distance table lookup.

The goal of the problem is to preprocess n strings of length d to quickly answer queries q of the form if there is a database string within edit distance r of q return a database string within edit distance cr of q. Previous approaches to this problem either rely on very large (superconstant) approximation ratios c or very small search radii r. Outside of a narrow parameter range these solutions are not competitive with trivially searching through all n strings. In this work give a simple and easy-to-implement hash function that can quickly answer queries for a wide range of parameters. Specifically our strategy can answer queries in time (d3^rn^1/c). The best known practical results require c gg r to achieve any correctness guarantee; meanwhile the best known theoretical results are very involved and difficult to implement and require query time at least 24^r. Our results significantly broaden the range of parameters for which we can achieve nontrivial bounds while retaining the practicality of a locality-sensitive hash function. We also show how to apply our ideas to the closely-related Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem for edit distance obtaining similar time bounds.</p>

	<td><p>Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval, due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover, to accurately capture the query variations, at the online retrieval stage, we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach from various aspects.</p>

However, one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper, we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective, our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network, whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics, and can be related to many recent `learning to hash’ paradigms. We show that, when properly designed, even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes, by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models. Experiments are conducted on conventional large-scale benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet, where the proposed simple model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of various types of multimodal data cross-modal deep hashing has received broad attention for solving cross-modal retrieval problems efficiently. Most cross-modal hashing methods follow the traditional supervised hashing framework in which the O(n^2) data pairs and O(n^3) data triplets are generated for training but the training procedure is less efficient because the complexity is high for large-scale dataset. To address these issues we propose a novel and efficient cross-modal hashing algorithm in which the unary loss is introduced. First of all We introduce the Cross-Modal Unary Loss (CMUL) with O(n) complexity to bridge the traditional triplet loss and classification-based unary loss. A more accurate bound of the triplet loss for structured multilabel data is also proposed in CMUL. Second we propose the novel Joint Cluster Cross-Modal Hashing (JCCH) algorithm for efficient hash learning in which the CMUL is involved. The resultant hashcodes form several clusters in which the hashcodes in the same cluster share similar semantic information and the heterogeneity gap on different modalities is diminished by sharing the clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to be applied to various types of data and experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior over or comparable with state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods and training with the proposed method is more efficient than others.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale data retrieval in many domains due to its low storage cost and high retrieval speed. Existing cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence between training samples across modalities are readily available. This assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition these methods generally require the same number of samples across different modalities which restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact of an incomplete correspondence it jointly optimizes in a unified objective function the potential correspondence the cross-modal hashing functions derived from the correspondence and a hashing quantitative loss. An alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the correspondence and hash functions and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of the two objectives. Experiments on publicly multi-modal datasets show that FlexCMH achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods and it indeed offers a high degree of flexibility for practical cross-modal hashing tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Hash based nearest neighbor search has become attractive in many applications. However the quantization in hashing usually degenerates the discriminative power when using Hamming distance ranking. Besides for large-scale visual search existing hashing methods cannot directly support the efficient search over the data with multiple sources and while the literature has shown that adaptively incorporating complementary information from diverse sources or views can significantly boost the search performance. To address the problems this paper proposes a novel and generic approach to building multiple hash tables with multiple views and generating fine-grained ranking results at bitwise and tablewise levels. For each hash table a query-adaptive bitwise weighting is introduced to alleviate the quantization loss by simultaneously exploiting the quality of hash functions and their complement for nearest neighbor search. From the tablewise aspect multiple hash tables are built for different data views as a joint index over which a query-specific rank fusion is proposed to rerank all results from the bitwise ranking by diffusing in a graph. Comprehensive experiments on image search over three well-known benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves up to 17.11 and 20.28 performance gains on single and multiple table search over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently learning to hash has been widely studied for image retrieval thanks to the computation and storage efficiency of binary codes. For most existing learning to hash methods sufficient training images are required and used to learn precise hashing codes. However in some real-world applications there are not always sufficient training images in the domain of interest. In addition some existing supervised approaches need a amount of labeled data which is an expensive process in term of time label and human expertise. To handle such problems inspired by transfer learning we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing method named Optimal Projection Guided Transfer Hashing (GTH) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain i.e. source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of interest i.e. target domain. Besides we propose to seek for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) solution of the hashing functions of target and source domains due to the domain gap. Furthermorean alternating optimization method is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains such that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually. Extensive experiments on various benchmark databases verify that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art learning to hash methods. The implementation details are available at httpsgithub.com/liuji93/GTH.</p>

However most existing hashing methods are based on hand-crafted or raw level features of objects which may not be optimally compatible with the coding process. Besides these hashing methods are mainly designed to handle simple pairwise similarity. The complex multilevel ranking semantic structure of instances associated with multiple labels has not been well explored yet. In this paper we propose a ranking-based deep cross-modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a semi-supervised semantic ranking list. Next to expand the semantic representation power of hand-crafted features RDCMH integrates the semantic ranking information into deep cross-modal hashing and jointly optimizes the compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions. Experiments on real multi-modal datasets show that RDCMH outperforms other competitive baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval applications.</p>

In this work we propose a different approach where we leverage graph convolutional networks to directly encode neighbor information into image descriptors. We further leverage ideas from clustering and manifold learning and introduce an unsupervised loss based on pairwise separation of image similarities. Empirically we demonstrate that our model is able to successfully learn a new descriptor space that significantly improves retrieval accuracy while still allowing efficient inner product inference.

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely studied for big data retrieval due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) aims to learn a hashing model that is trained using only samples from seen categories but can generalize well to samples of unseen categories. ZSH generally uses category attributes to seek a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen categories to unseen ones. As a result it may perform poorly when labeled data are insufficient. ZSH methods are mainly designed for single-modality data which prevents their application to the widely spread multi-modal data. On the other hand existing cross-modal hashing solutions assume that all the modalities share the same category labels while in practice the labels of different data modalities may be different. To address these issues we propose a general Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing (CZHash) solution to effectively leverage unlabeled and labeled multi-modality data with different label spaces. CZHash first quantifies the composite similarity between instances using label and feature information. It then defines an objective function to achieve deep feature learning compatible with the composite similarity preserving category attribute space learning and hashing coding function learning. CZHash further introduces an alternative optimization procedure to jointly optimize these learning objectives. Experiments on benchmark multi-modal datasets show that CZHash significantly outperforms related representative hashing approaches both on effectiveness and adaptability.</p>

The proposed MoBoost is used to improve model parameter optimization for linear-based hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed MoBoost, given a linear-based hashing method, we first execute the method several times to get several different hash codes for training samples, and then combine these different hash codes into one set utilizing one novel fusion strategy. Based on this set of hash codes, we learn some new parameters for the linear hash function that can significantly improve accuracy. The proposed MoBoost can be generally adopted in existing linear-based hashing methods, achieving more precise and stable performance compared to the original methods while imposing negligible added expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments are performed based on three benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework.</p>

It encodes the online streaming data into compact binary codes and simultaneously updates the hash functions to renew codes of the existing dataset. To this end the existing methods update hash functions solely based on the new data batch without investigating the correlation between such new data and the existing dataset. In addition existing works update the hash functions using a relaxation process in its corresponding approximated continuous space. And it remains as an open problem to directly apply discrete optimizations in online hashing. In this paper we propose a novel supervised online hashing method termed Balanced Similarity for Online Discrete Hashing (BSODH) to solve the above problems in a unified framework. BSODH employs a well-designed hashing algorithm to preserve the similarity between the streaming data and the existing dataset via an asymmetric graph regularization. We further identify the data-imbalance problem brought by the constructed asymmetric graph which restricts the application of discrete optimization in our problem. Therefore a novel balanced similarity is further proposed which uses two equilibrium factors to balance the similar and dissimilar weights and eventually enables the usage of discrete optimizations.

Specifically we first transform the discrete similarity matrix into a probability matrix via a Gaussian-based normalization to address the extremely imbalanced distribution issue. And then we introduce a scaling Student t-distribution to solve the challenging initialization problem and efficiently bridge the gap between the known and unknown distributions. Lastly we align the two distributions via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-diverence) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by which an intuitive similarity constraint is imposed to update hashing model on the new streaming data with a powerful generalizing ability to the past data. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed SDOH over the state-of-the-art methods in the online retrieval task.</p>

In this paper, we address the semi-supervised quantization problem by considering: (i) pairwise similarity information (without class label information) across different domains, which captures the intra-document relation, (ii) cross-domain data with class label which can help capture inter-document relation, and (iii) cross-domain data with neither pairwise similarity nor class label which enables the full use of abundant unlabelled information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both supervised information (pairwise similarity + class label) and unsupervised information (neither pairwise similarity nor class label) simultaneously in composite quantization. A challenging problem arises: how can we jointly handle these three sorts of information across multiple domains in an efficient way? To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep quantization (SSDQ) model that takes both supervised and unsupervised information into account. The proposed SSDQ model is capable of incorporating the above three kinds of information into one single framework when utilizing composite quantization for accurate and efficient queries across different domains. More specifically, we employ a modified deep autoencoder for better latent representation and formulate pairwise similarity loss, supervised quantization loss as well as unsupervised distribution match loss to handle all three types of information. The extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement of SSDQ over several state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</p>

However existing hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval cannot fully capture the heterogeneous multi-modal correlation and exploit the semantic information. In this paper we propose a novel (FDCH) approach. Firstly FDCH learns unified binary codes through a fusion hash network with paired samples as input which effectively enhances the modeling of the correlation of heterogeneous multi-modal data. Then these high-quality unified hash codes further supervise the training of the modality-specific hash networks for encoding out-of-sample queries. Meanwhile both pair-wise similarity information and classification information are embedded in the hash networks under one stream framework which simultaneously preserves cross-modal similarity and keeps semantic consistency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of FDCH.</p>

Typically hashing methods are essential for the use of Jaccard similarity to be practical in large-scale settings. For hashing binary (0/1) data the idea of one permutation hashing (OPH) with densification significantly accelerates traditional minwise hashing algorithms while providing unbiased and accurate estimates. In this paper we propose a strategy named “re-randomization” in the process of densification that could achieve the smallest variance among all densification schemes. The success of this idea naturally inspires us to generalize one permutation hashing to weighted (non-binary) data which results in the socalled “bin-wise consistent weighted sampling (BCWS)” algorithm. We analyze the behavior of BCWS and compare it with a recent alternative. Extensive experiments on various datasets illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel hashing method called deep multi-index hashing (DMIH) to improve both efficiency and accuracy for ReID. DMIH seamlessly integrates multi-index hashing and multi-branch based networks into the same framework. Furthermore a novel block-wise multi-index hashing table construction approach and a search-aware multi-index (SAMI) loss are proposed in DMIH to improve the search efficiency. Experiments on three widely used datasets show that DMIH can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines including both hashing methods and real-valued methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

Discrete hashing methods are thus beneficial because they map high-dimensional data to compact binary codes that are efficient to store and process while preserving semantic similarity. To optimize powerful deep learning methods for image hashing gradient-based methods are required. Binary codes however are discrete and thus have no continuous derivatives. Relaxing the problem by solving it in a continuous space and then quantizing the solution is not guaranteed to yield separable binary codes. The quantization needs to be included in the optimization. In this paper we push for quantization We optimize maximum class separability in the binary space. We introduce a margin on distances between dissimilar image pairs as measured in the binary space. In addition to pair-wise distances we draw inspiration from Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisher LDA) to maximize the binary distances between classes and at the same time minimize the binary distance of images within the same class.

The objective of video segment copy detection is to find the video (s) present in a large database one of whose segments (cropped in time) is a (transformed) copy of the given query video. This transformation may be temporal (for example frame dropping change in frame rate) or spatial (brightness and contrast change addition of noise etc.) in nature although the primary focus of this report is detecting temporal attacks. The video hashing method proposed by us uses a deep learning neural network to learn variable length binary hash codes for the entire video considering both temporal and spatial features into account. This is in contrast to most existing video hashing methods as they use conventional image hashing techniques to obtain hash codes for a video after extracting features for every frame or certain key frames in which case the temporal information present in the video is not exploited. Our hashing method is specifically resilient to time cropping making it extremely useful in video segment copy detection. Experimental results obtained on the large augmented dataset consisting of around 25000 videos with segment copies demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed video hashing method.</p>

	<td><p>This paper tackles a rarely explored but critical problem within learning to hash, i.e., to learn hash codes that effectively discriminate hard similar and dissimilar examples, to empower large-scale image retrieval. Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore, effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance, enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However, most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples, i.e., distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss, which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically, the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples. Extensive empirical results on three widely-used image retrieval datasets show that (i) our method consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods using hash codes of the same length and (ii) our method can use significantly (e.g., 50%-75%) shorter hash codes to perform substantially better than, or comparably well to, the competing methods.</p>

Specifically CUH jointly performs the multi-view clustering that projects the original data points from different modalities into its own low-dimensional latent semantic space and finds the cluster centroid points and the common clustering indicators in its own low-dimensional space and learns the compact hash codes and the corresponding linear hash functions. An discrete optimization framework is developed to learn the unified binary codes across modalities under the guidance cluster-wise code-prototypes.

	<td><p>With the growth of image on the web research on hashing which enables high-speed image retrieval has been actively studied. In recent years various hashing methods based on deep neural networks have been proposed and achieved higher precision than the other hashing methods. In these methods multiple losses for hash codes and the parameters of neural networks are defined. They generate hash codes that minimize the weighted sum of the losses. Therefore an expert has to tune the weights for the losses heuristically and the probabilistic optimality of the loss function cannot be explained. In order to generate explainable hash codes without weight tuning we theoretically derive a single loss function with no hyperparameters for the hash code from the probability distribution of the images. By generating hash codes that minimize this loss function highly accurate image retrieval with probabilistic optimality is performed. We evaluate the performance of hashing using MNIST CIFAR-10 SVHN and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently randomly mapping vectorial data to strings of discrete symbols (i.e. sketches) for fast and space-efficient similarity searches has become popular. Such random mapping is called similarity-preserving hashing and approximates a similarity metric by using the Hamming distance. Although many efficient similarity searches have been proposed most of them are designed for binary sketches. Similarity searches on integer sketches are in their infancy. In this paper we present a novel space-efficient trie named b-bit sketch trie on integer sketches for scalable similarity searches by leveraging the idea behind succinct data structures (i.e. space-efficient data structures while supporting various data operations in the compressed format) and a favorable property of integer sketches as fixed-length strings. Our experimental results obtained using real-world datasets show that a trie-based index is built from integer sketches and efficiently performs similarity searches on the index by pruning useless portions of the search space which greatly improves the search time and space-efficiency of the similarity search. The experimental results show that our similarity search is at most one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art similarity searches. Besides our method needs only 10 GiB of memory on a billion-scale database while state-of-the-art similarity searches need 29 GiB of memory.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely applied to multimodal retrieval on large-scale multimedia data due to its efficiency in computation and storage. In this article we propose a novel deep semantic multimodal hashing network (DSMHN) for scalable image-text and video-text retrieval. The proposed deep hashing framework leverages 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the backbone network to capture the spatial information for image-text retrieval while the 3-D CNN as the backbone network to capture the spatial and temporal information for video-text retrieval. In the DSMHN two sets of modality-specific hash functions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both intermodality similarities and intramodality semantic labels. Specifically with the assumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for the classification task two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by embedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Moreover a unified deep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality hash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning intermodality similarity-preserving learning semantic label-preserving learning and hash function learning with different types of loss functions simultaneously. The proposed DSMHN method is a generic and scalable deep hashing framework for both image-text and video-text retrievals which can be flexibly integrated with different types of loss functions. We conduct extensive experiments for both single modal- and cross-modal-retrieval tasks on four widely used multimodal-retrieval data sets. Experimental results on both image-text- and video-text-retrieval tasks demonstrate that the DSMHN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Generally most existing hash clustering methods are single-view ones which lack complete structure or complementary information from multiple views. For cluster tasks abundant prior researches mainly focus on learning discrete hash code while few works take original data structure into consideration. To address these problems we propose a novel binary code algorithm for clustering which adopts graph embedding to preserve the original data structure called (Graph-based Multi-view Binary Learning) GMBL in this paper. GMBL mainly focuses on encoding the information of multiple views into a compact binary code which explores complementary information from multiple views. In particular in order to maintain the graph-based structure of the original data we adopt a Laplacian matrix to preserve the local linear relationship of the data and map it to the Hamming space. Considering different views have distinctive contributions to the final clustering results GMBL adopts a strategy of automatically assign weights for each view to better guide the clustering. Finally An alternating iterative optimization method is adopted to optimize discrete binary codes directly instead of relaxing the binary constraint in two steps. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with previous approaches in terms of clustering performance.</p>

Bucket search also called hash lookup can achieve fast query speed with a sub-linear time cost based on the inverted index table constructed from hash codes. Many metrics have been adopted to evaluate hashing algorithms. However all existing metrics are improper to evaluate the hash codes for bucket search. On one hand all existing metrics ignore the retrieval time cost which is an important factor reflecting the performance of search. On the other hand some of them such as mean average precision (MAP) suffer from the uncertainty problem as the ranked list is based on integer-valued Hamming distance and are insensitive to Hamming radius as these metrics only depend on relative Hamming distance. Other metrics such as precision at Hamming radius R fail to evaluate global performance as these metrics only depend on one specific Hamming radius. In this paper we first point out the problems of existing metrics which have been ignored by the hashing community and then propose a novel evaluation metric called radius aware mean average precision (RAMAP) to evaluate hash codes for bucket search. Furthermore two coding strategies are also proposed to qualitatively show the problems of existing metrics. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed RAMAP can provide more proper evaluation than existing metrics.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing enables computation and memory efficient
image search through end-to-end learning of feature representations and binary codes. While linear scan over binary
hash codes is more efficient than over the high-dimensional
representations, its linear-time complexity is still unacceptable for very large databases. Hamming space retrieval enables constant-time search through hash lookups, where for
each query, there is a Hamming ball centered at the query
and the data points within the ball are returned as relevant.
Since inside the Hamming ball implies retrievable while
outside irretrievable, it is crucial to explicitly characterize
the Hamming ball. The main idea of this work is to directly
embody the Hamming radius into the loss functions, leading
to Maximum-Margin Hamming Hashing (MMHH), a new
model specifically optimized for Hamming space retrieval.
We introduce a max-margin t-distribution loss, where the
t-distribution concentrates more similar data points to be
within the Hamming ball, and the margin characterizes the
Hamming radius such that less penalization is applied to
similar data points within the Hamming ball. The loss function also introduces robustness to data noise, where the similarity supervision may be inaccurate in practical problems.
The model is trained end-to-end using a new semi-batch optimization algorithm tailored to extremely imbalanced data.
Our method yields state-of-the-art results on four datasets
and shows superior performance on noisy data.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel image hashing method termed as symmetric eep emantic uantization (). is implemented using three stream frameworks which consist of one and two .

Furthermore can utilize the most critical semantic information to guide the feature learning process and consider the consistency of the common semantic space and Hamming space.

As deep learning has shown its superior performance on many computer vision applications, recent designs of learning-based hashing models have been moving from shallow ones to deep architectures.

In the worst case, the paired hash codes switch their directions after update, and consequently, their corresponding distance in the Hamming space remain unchanged. This makes the overall learning process highly inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a new deep hashing model integrated with a novel gradient attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm is able to accelerate the learning process and obtain competitive retrieval performance compared with state-of-the-art deep hashing models.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing, due to its low storage cost and high query speed, has been successfully used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications. It projects high-dimensional data into a shared isomorphic Hamming space with similar binary codes for semantically-similar data. In some applications, all modalities may not be obtained or trained simultaneously for some reasons, such as privacy, secret, storage limitation, and computational resource limitation. However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods need all modalities to jointly learn the common Hamming space, thus hindering them from handling these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Separated Variational Hashing Networks (SVHNs) to overcome the above challenge. Firstly, it adopts a label network (LabNet) to exploit available and nonspecific label annotations to learn a latent common Hamming space by projecting each semantic label into a common binary representation. Then, each modality-specific network can separately map the samples of the corresponding modality into their binary semantic codes learned by LabNet. We achieve it by conducting variational inference to match the aggregated posterior of the hashing code of LabNet with an arbitrary prior distribution. The effectiveness and efficiency of our SVHNs are verified by extensive experiments carried out on four widely-used multimedia databases, in comparison with 11 state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Driven by the urgent demand for managing remote sensing big data large-scale remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) attracts increasing attention in the remote sensing field. In general existing retrieval methods can be regarded as visual-based retrieval approaches which search and return a set of similar images from a database to a given query image. Although retrieval methods have achieved great success there is still a question that needs to be responded to Can we obtain the accurate semantic labels of the returned similar images to further help analyzing and processing imagery Inspired by the above question in this paper we redefine the image retrieval problem as visual and semantic retrieval of images. Specifically we propose a novel deep hashing convolutional neural network (DHCNN) to simultaneously retrieve the similar images and classify their semantic labels in a unified framework. In more detail a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract high-dimensional deep features. Then a hash layer is perfectly inserted into the network to transfer the deep features into compact hash codes. In addition a fully connected layer with a softmax function is performed on hash layer to generate class distribution. Finally a loss function is elaborately designed to simultaneously consider the label loss of each image and similarity loss of pairs of images. Experimental results on two remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-art retrieval and classification performance.</p>

	<td><p>Fine-grained image hashing is a challenging problem due to the difficulties of discriminative region localization and hash code generation. Most existing deep hashing approaches solve the two tasks independently. While these two tasks are correlated and can reinforce each other. In this paper we propose a deep fine-grained hashing to simultaneously localize the discriminative regions and generate the efficient binary codes. The proposed approach consists of a region localization module and a hash coding module. The region localization module aims to provide informative regions to the hash coding module. The hash coding module aims to generate effective binary codes and give feedback for learning better localizer. Moreover to better capture subtle differences multi-scale regions at different layers are learned without the need of bounding-box/part annotations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmark fine-grained datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of our method relative to other fine-grained hashing algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>Supervised cross-modal hashing has gained increasing research interest on large-scale retrieval task owning to its satisfactory performance and efficiency. However it still has some challenging issues to be further studied 1) most of them fail to well preserve the semantic correlations in hash codes because of the large heterogenous gap; 2) most of them relax the discrete constraint on hash codes leading to large quantization error and consequent low performance; 3) most of them suffer from relatively high memory cost and computational complexity during training procedure which makes them unscalable. In this paper to address above issues we propose a supervised cross-modal hashing method based on matrix factorization dubbed Efficient Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically collective matrix factorization on heterogenous features and semantic embedding with class labels are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore the feature based similarities and semantic correlations can be both preserved in hash codes which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative. Then an efficient discrete optimal algorithm is proposed to handle the scalable issue. Instead of learning hash codes bit-by-bit hash codes matrix can be obtained directly which is more efficient. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that EDSH produces a superior performance in both accuracy and scalability over some existing cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

<p>Cross-modal hashing encodes the multimedia data into a common binary hash space in which the correlations among the samples from different modalities can be effectively measured. Deep cross-modal hashing further improves the retrieval performance as the deep neural networks can generate more semantic relevant features and hash codes. In this paper, we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash coding and propose Deep Joint Semantics Reconstructing Hashing (DJSRH), which has the following two main advantages. First, to learn binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure of the original data, DJSRH constructs a novel joint-semantics affinity matrix which elaborately integrates the original neighborhood information from different modalities and accordingly is capable to capture the latent intrinsic semantic affinity for the input multi-modal instances. Second, DJSRH later trains the networks to generate binary codes that maximally reconstruct above joint-semantics relations via the proposed reconstructing framework, which is more competent for the batch-wise training as it reconstructs the specific similarity value unlike the common Laplacian constraint merely preserving the similarity order. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement by DJSRH in various cross-modal retrieval tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Feature hashing and other random projection schemes are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. The goal is to efficiently project a high-dimensional feature vector living in R^n into a much lower-dimensional space R^m while approximately preserving Euclidean norm. These schemes can be constructed using sparse random projections for example using a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform. A line of work introduced by Weinberger et. al (ICML 09) analyzes the accuracy of sparse JL with sparsity 1 on feature vectors with small linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio. Recently Freksen Kamma and Larsen (NeurIPS 18) closed this line of work by proving a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for sparse JL with sparsity 1. In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of using sparsity s greater than 1 in sparse JL on feature vectors. Our main result is a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for a general sparsity s that significantly generalizes the result of Freksen et. al. Our result theoretically demonstrates that sparse JL with s 1 can have significantly better norm-preservation properties on feature vectors than sparse JL with s = 1; we also empirically demonstrate this finding.</p>

	<td><p>Hash coding has been widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels which we call unseen images zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper for the first time a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data. Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the competing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes. Recent advances in this area have been obtained through neural network based models generative models trained by learning to reconstruct the original documents. We present a novel unsupervised generative semantic hashing approach (RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component. Similarly to variational autoencoders the variational component is trained to reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code and as in prior work it only considers documents individually. The ranking component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity into the hash code generation modelling document ranking through a hinge loss. To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss we use a weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised. Extensive experimental evaluation on four publicly available datasets against traditional baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods for semantic hashing shows that RBSH significantly outperforms all other methods across all evaluated hash code lengths. In fact RBSH hash codes are able to perform similarly to state-of-the-art hash codes while using 2-4x fewer bits.</p>

To this end we propose a novel two-pyramid hashing architecture to learn both the semantic information and the subtle appearance details for fine-grained image search. Inspired by the feature pyramids of convolutional neural network a vertical pyramid is proposed to capture the high-layer features and a horizontal pyramid combines multiple low-layer features with structural information to capture the subtle differences. To fuse the low-level features a novel combination strategy called consensus fusion is proposed to capture all subtle information from several low-layers for finer retrieval.

In this paper we propose a novel learning-based hashing method called Supervised Discrete Hashing with Relaxation (SDHR) based on Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH). SDH uses ordinary least squares regression and traditional zero-one matrix encoding of class label information as the regression target (code words) thus fixing the regression target. In SDHR the regression target is instead optimized. The optimized regression target matrix satisfies a large margin constraint for correct classification of each example. Compared with SDH which uses the traditional zero-one matrix SDHR utilizes the learned regression target matrix and therefore more accurately measures the classification error of the regression model and is more flexible. As expected SDHR generally outperforms SDH. Experimental results on two large-scale image datasets (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) and a large-scale and challenging face dataset (FRGC) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SDHR.</p>

In this paper we propose a new learning-based hashing method called</code>fast supervised discrete hashing (FSDH) based on ``supervised discrete hashing (SDH). Regressing the training examples (or hash code) to the corresponding class labels is widely used in ordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method FSDH uses a very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples to the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems with the most critical sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC) which is time-consuming. However FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than iterative hash code-solving step which is highly efficient. Furthermore FSDH is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares regression making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example our results show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base and FSDH is about 151-times faster than FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base. Our experimental results show that FSDH is not only fast but also outperforms other comparative methods.</p>

As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes less structured (as is common for big-data applications) the need for efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce HashGraph a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts taken from sparse graph representations–hence the name HashGraph. We show two different variants of HashGraph a simple algorithm that outlines the method to create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use open-addressing or chaining yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph currently works for static inputs though recent progress with dynamic graph data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining approaches have. Further we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the load-factor. Lastly we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of value lookups. Given the above HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs though HashGraph is not architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU HashGraph is anywhere from 2X-8X faster than cuDPP WarpDrive and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the same rate.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the high storage and search efficiency hashing has become prevalent for large-scale similarity search. Particularly deep hashing methods have greatly improved the search performance under supervised scenarios. In contrast unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of reliable supervisory similarity signals. To address this issue we propose a novel deep unsupervised hashing model dubbed DistillHash which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data pairs which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically we investigate the relationship between the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal classifier. We show that under a mild assumption some data pairs of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier can be potentially distilled. Inspired by this fact we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the state-of-the-art search performance.</p>

The process is computationally expensive ill-posed to illumination background composition pose variation as well as inefficient to be deployed on gallery sets with more than 1000 elements. Hashing is a faster alternative which involves representing images in reduced dimensional simple feature spaces. Encoding images into binary hash codes enables similarity comparison in an image-pair using the Hamming distance measure. The challenge however lies in encoding the images using a semantic hashing scheme that lets subjective neighbors lie within the tolerable Hamming radius. This work presents a solution employing adversarial learning of a deep neural semantic hashing network for fashion inventory retrieval. It consists of a feature extracting convolutional neural network (CNN) learned to (i) minimize error in classifying type of clothing (ii) minimize hamming distance between semantic neighbors and maximize distance between semantically dissimilar images (iii) maximally scramble a discriminators ability to identify the corresponding hash code-image pair when processing a semantically similar query-gallery image pair. Experimental validation for fashion inventory search yields a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.65 in finding the closest match as compared to 53.26 obtained by the prior art of deep Cauchy hashing for hamming space retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However, large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain, thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand, unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information, although raw tags, in general, do not readily lead to semantic labels.
Motivated by this scenario, we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically, we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning.
Accordingly, we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space. The queries and the binary code database are projected asymmetrically to further improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on two multi-label image databases demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method for multi-label image retrieval.</p>

In this work we propose a new similarity metric termed as with which the hash codes of similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept i.e. that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally we propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval performance i.e. 3-20 in mAP over the previous state-of-the-arts.

Our approach simultaneously learns a mapping that transforms the input images into a low-dimensional discriminative space and quantizes the transformed data points using multi-codebook quantization. To eliminate the negative effect of norm variance on codebook learning we force the network to L_2 normalize the extracted features and then quantize the resulting vectors using a new supervised quantization technique specifically designed for points lying on a unit hypersphere. Furthermore we introduce an easy-to-implement extension of our quantization technique that enforces sparsity on the codebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSQ and its sparse variant can generate semantically separable compact binary codes outperforming many state-of-the-art image retrieval methods on three benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is promising for large-scale information retrieval tasks thanks to the efficiency of distance evaluation between binary codes. Generative hashing is often used to generate hashing codes in an unsupervised way. However existing generative hashing methods only considered the use of simple priors like Gaussian and Bernoulli priors which limits these methods to further improve their performance. In this paper two mixture-prior generative models are proposed under the objective to produce high-quality hashing codes for documents. Specifically a Gaussian mixture prior is first imposed onto the variational auto-encoder (VAE) followed by a separate step to cast the continuous latent representation of VAE into binary code. To avoid the performance loss caused by the separate casting a model using a Bernoulli mixture prior is further developed in which an end-to-end training is admitted by resorting to the straight-through (ST) discrete gradient estimator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods especially the one using Bernoulli mixture priors consistently outperform existing ones by a substantial margin.</p>

In combination with a hash algorithm that maps those weighted sets to compact signatures which allow fast estimation of pairwise similarities it constitutes a valuable method for big data applications such as near-duplicate detection nearest neighbor search or clustering. This paper introduces a class of one-pass locality-sensitive hash algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster than the original approach. The performance gain is achieved by calculating signature components not independently but collectively. Four different algorithms are proposed based on this idea. Two of them are statistically equivalent to the original approach and can be used as drop-in replacements. The other two may even improve the estimation error by introducing statistical dependence between signature components. Moreover the presented techniques can be specialized for the conventional Jaccard similarity resulting in highly efficient algorithms that outperform traditional minwise hashing and that are able to compete with the state of the art.</p>

However there exists an ambiguity problem that lots of binary codes share the same Hamming distance to a query. To alleviate the ambiguity problem weighted binary codes assign different weights to each bit of binary codes and compare the binary codes by the weighted Hamming distance. Till now performing the querying from the weighted binary codes efficiently is still an open issue. In this paper we propose a new method to rank the weighted binary codes and return the nearest weighted binary codes of the query efficiently. In our method based on the multi-index hash tables two algorithms the table bucket finding algorithm and the table merging algorithm are proposed to select the nearest weighted binary codes of the query in a non-exhaustive and accurate way. The proposed algorithms are justified by proving their theoretic properties. The experiments on three large-scale datasets validate both the search efficiency and the search accuracy of our method.

	<td><p>Representing images by compact hash codes is an attractive approach for large-scale content-based image retrieval. In most state-of-the-art hashing-based image retrieval systems for each image local descriptors are first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous works the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. Hence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors. Furthermore we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>With benefits of fast query speed and low storage cost hashing-based image retrieval approaches have garnered considerable attention from the research community. In this paper we propose a novel Error-Corrected Deep Cross Modal Hashing (CMH-ECC) method which uses a bitmap specifying the presence of certain facial attributes as an input query to retrieve relevant face images from the database. In this architecture we generate compact hash codes using an end-to-end deep learning module which effectively captures the inherent relationships between the face and attribute modality. We also integrate our deep learning module with forward error correction codes to further reduce the distance between different modalities of the same subject. Specifically the properties of deep hashing and forward error correction codes are exploited to design a cross modal hashing framework with high retrieval performance. Experimental results using two standard datasets with facial attributes-image modalities indicate that our CMH-ECC face image retrieval model outperforms most of the current attribute-based face image retrieval approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been recognized as an efficient representation learning method to effectively handle big data due to its low computational complexity and memory cost. Most of the existing hashing methods focus on learning the low-dimensional vectorized binary features based on the high-dimensional raw vectorized features. However studies on how to obtain preferable binary codes from the original 2D image features for retrieval is very limited. This paper proposes a bilinear supervised discrete hashing (BSDH) method based on 2D image features which utilizes bilinear projections to binarize the image matrix features such that the intrinsic characteristics in the 2D image space are preserved in the learned binary codes. Meanwhile the bilinear projection approximation and vectorization binary codes regression are seamlessly integrated together to formulate the final robust learning framework. Furthermore a discrete optimization strategy is developed to alternatively update each variable for obtaining the high-quality binary codes. In addition two 2D image features traditional SURF-based FVLAD feature and CNN-based AlexConv5 feature are designed for further improving the performance of the proposed BSDH method. Results of extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed BSDH method almost outperforms all competing hashing methods with different input features by different evaluation protocols.</p>

	<td><p>Given the benefits of its low storage requirements and high retrieval efficiency hashing has recently received increasing attention. In particularcross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in multimedia similarity search applications. However almost all existing methods employing cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their ignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains richer semantic information leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for cross-modal retrieval. First we utilize the triplet labels which describes the relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to capture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We then establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal view to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally graph regularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the original semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on two popular cross-modal datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has shown great potential in large-scale image retrieval due to its storage and computation efficiency, especially the recent deep supervised hashing methods. To achieve promising performance, deep supervised hashing methods require a large amount of training data from different classes. However, when images of new categories emerge, existing deep hashing methods have to retrain the CNN model and generate hash codes for all the database images again, which is impractical for large-scale retrieval system.
In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing framework, called Deep Incremental Hashing Network (DIHN), for learning hash codes in an incremental manner. DIHN learns the hash codes for the new coming images directly, while keeping the old ones unchanged. Simultaneously, a deep hash function for query set is learned by preserving the similarities between training points. Extensive experiments on two widely used image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DIHN framework can significantly decrease the training time while keeping the state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.</p>

	<td><p>Recently, a series of deep supervised hashing methods were proposed for binary code learning. However, due to the high computation cost and the limited hardware’s memory, these methods will first select a subset from the training set, and then form a mini-batch data to update the network in each iteration. Therefore, the remaining labeled data cannot be fully utilized and the model cannot directly obtain the binary codes of the entire training set for retrieval. To address these problems, this paper proposes an interesting regularized deep model to seamlessly integrate the advantages of deep hashing and efficient binary code learning by using the anchor graph. As such, the deep features and label matrix can be jointly used to optimize the binary codes, and the network can obtain more discriminative feedback from the linear combinations of the learned bits. Moreover, we also reveal the algorithm mechanism and its computation essence. Experiments on three large-scale datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves better retrieval performance with less training time compared to previous deep hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>As an approximate nearest neighbor search technique hashing has been widely applied in large-scale image retrieval due to its excellent efficiency. Most supervised deep hashing methods have similar loss designs with embedding learning while quantizing the continuous high-dim feature into compact binary space. We argue that the existing deep hashing schemes are defective in two issues that seriously affect the performance i.e. bit independence and bit balance. The former refers to hash codes of different classes should be independent of each other while the latter means each bit should have a balanced distribution of +1s and -1s. In this paper we propose a novel supervised deep hashing method termed Hadamard Codebook based Deep Hashing (HCDH) which solves the above two problems in a unified formulation. Specifically we utilize an off-the-shelf algorithm to generate a binary Hadamard codebook to satisfy the requirement of bit independence and bit balance which subsequently serves as the desired outputs of the hash functions learning. We also introduce a projection matrix to solve the inconsistency between the order of Hadamard matrix and the number of classes. Besides the proposed HCDH further exploits the supervised labels by constructing a classifier on top of the outputs of hash functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCDH can yield discriminative and balanced binary codes which well outperforms many state-of-the-arts on three widely-used benchmarks.</p>

However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines.</p>

Although the straightforward metrization and symmetrization is usually ineffective we find that constructing an index using a modified e.g. symmetrized distance can improve performance.

This paper proposes a dual-stream learning framework dubbed Deep Collaborative Discrete Hashing (DCDH) which constructs a discriminative common discrete space by collaboratively incorporating the shared and individual semantics deduced from visual features and semantic labels. Specifically the context-aware representations are generated by employing the outer product of visual embeddings and semantic encodings. Moreover we reconstruct the labels and introduce the focal loss to take advantage of frequent and rare concepts. The common binary code space is built on the joint learning of the visual representations attended by language the semantic-invariant structure construction and the label distribution correction.

In this work we build upon the idea of using semantic hierarchies to form distance metrics between all available sample labels; for example cat to dog has a smaller distance than cat to guitar. We combine this type of semantic distance into a loss function to promote similar distances between the deep neural network embeddings. We also introduce an empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence loss term to promote binarization and uniformity of the embeddings.

 To address this issue, we propose
a novel deep unsupervised hashing model, dubbed DistillHash, which can learn a distilled data set consisted of data
pairs, which have confidence similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial
noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and
the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal

data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier, can be potentially
distilled. Inspired by this fact, we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further
adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that the
proposed DistillHash consistently accomplishes the stateof-the-art search performance.</p>

efficient cross-media retrieval. Typically, existing methods on crossmodal hashing treat labels of one instance independently but
overlook the correlations among labels. Indeed, in many real-world
scenarios, like the online fashion domain, instances (items) are
labeled with a set of categories correlated by certain hierarchy. In
this paper, we propose a new end-to-end solution for supervised
cross-modal hashing, named HiCHNet, which explicitly exploits the
hierarchical labels of instances. In particular, by the pre-established
label hierarchy, we comprehensively characterize each modality
of the instance with a set of layer-wise hash representations. In
essence, hash codes are encouraged to not only preserve the layerwise semantic similarities encoded by the label hierarchy, but also
retain the hierarchical discriminative capabilities. Due to the lack
of benchmark datasets, apart from adapting the existing dataset
FashionVC from fashion domain, we create a dataset from the
online fashion platform Ssense consisting of 15, 696 image-text

While face images are typically represented as vectors in Euclidean space characterizing face videos with some robust set modeling techniques (e.g. covariance matrices as exploited in this study which reside on Riemannian manifold) has recently shown appealing advantages. This hence results in a thorny heterogeneous spaces matching problem. Moreover hashing with handcrafted features as done in many existing works is clearly inadequate to achieve desirable performance for this task. To address such problems we present an end-to-end Deep Heterogeneous Hashing (DHH) method that integrates three stages including image feature learning video modeling and heterogeneous hashing in a single framework to learn unified binary codes for both face images and videos. To tackle the key challenge of hashing on the manifold a well-studied Riemannian kernel mapping is employed to project data (i.e. covariance matrices) into Euclidean space and thus enables to embed the two heterogeneous representations into a common Hamming space where both intra-space discriminability and inter-space compatibility are considered. To perform network optimization the gradient of the kernel mapping is innovatively derived via structured matrix backpropagation in a theoretically principled way. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method achieves quite competitive performance compared with existing hashing methods.</p>

Particularly supervised hashing has recently received considerable research attention by leveraging the label information to preserve the pairwise similarities of data points in the Hamming space. However there still remain two crucial bottlenecks 1) the learning process of the full pairwise similarity preservation is computationally unaffordable and unscalable to deal with big data; 2) the available category information of data are not well-explored to learn discriminative hash functions. To overcome these challenges we propose a unified Semantic-Aware DIscrete Hashing (SADIH) framework which aims to directly embed the transformed semantic information into the asymmetric similarity approximation and discriminative hashing function learning. Specifically a semantic-aware latent embedding is introduced to asymmetrically preserve the full pairwise similarities while skillfully handle the cumbersome n times n pairwise similarity matrix. Meanwhile a semantic-aware autoencoder is developed to jointly preserve the data structures in the discriminative latent semantic space and perform data reconstruction. Moreover an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that our SADIH can clearly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the additional benefit of lower computational costs.</p>

	<td><p>In large scale systems approximate nearest neighbour search is a crucial algorithm to enable efficient data retrievals. Recently deep learning-based hashing algorithms have been proposed as a promising paradigm to enable data dependent schemes. Often their efficacy is only demonstrated on data sets with fixed limited numbers of classes. In practical scenarios those labels are not always available or one requires a method that can handle a higher input variability as well as a higher granularity. To fulfil those requirements we look at more flexible similarity measures. In this work we present a novel flexible end-to-end trainable network for large-scale data hashing. Our method works by transforming the data distribution to behave as a uniform distribution on a product of spheres. The transformed data is subsequently hashed to a binary form in a way that maximises entropy of the output (i.e. to fully utilise the available bit-rate capacity) while maintaining the correctness (i.e. close items hash to the same key in the map). We show that the method outperforms baseline approaches such as locality-sensitive hashing and product quantisation in the limited capacity regime.</p>

To overcome this problem in this paper we introduce a metric-learning based hashing network which learns 1) a semantic-based metric space for effective feature representation; and 2) compact binary hash codes for fast archive search. Our network considers an interplay of multiple loss functions that allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when binarized. Experiments carried out on two benchmark RS archives point out that the proposed network significantly improves the retrieval performance under the same retrieval time when compared to the state-of-the-art hashing methods in RS.</p>

To solve this problem we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to the learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically we propose a novel deep hashing model named deep saliency hashing (DSaH) which automatically mines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes simultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic components including the semantic loss the saliency loss and the quantization loss.

We conduct extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets including Oxford Flowers-17 Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird demonstrate that our DSaH performs the best for fine-grained retrieval task and beats the strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10 on both Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird.

	<td><p>Zero-Shot Hashing aims at learning a hashing model that is trained only by instances from seen categories but can generate well to those of unseen categories. Typically it is achieved by utilizing a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen domain to unseen domain. Existing efforts mainly focus on single-modal retrieval task especially Image-Based Image Retrieval (IBIR). However as a highlighted research topic in the field of hashing cross-modal retrieval is more common in real world applications. To address the Cross-Modal Zero-Shot Hashing (CMZSH) retrieval task we propose a novel Attribute-Guided Network (AgNet) which can perform not only IBIR but also Text-Based Image Retrieval (TBIR). In particular AgNet aligns different modal data into a semantically rich attribute space which bridges the gap caused by modality heterogeneity and zero-shot setting. We also design an effective strategy that exploits the attribute to guide the generation of hash codes for image and text within the same network. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (AwA SUN and ImageNet) demonstrate the superiority of AgNet on both cross-modal and single-modal zero-shot image retrieval tasks.</p>

scalable image search. While a variety of deep hashing methods have been
proposed in recent years, most of them are confronted by the dilemma
to obtain optimal binary codes in a truly end-to-end manner with nonsmooth sign activations. Unlike existing methods which usually employ a
general relaxation framework to adapt to the gradient-based algorithms,
our approach formulates the non-smooth part of the hashing network
as sampling with a stochastic policy, so that the retrieval performance
degradation caused by the relaxation can be avoided. Specifically, our
method directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation, where the network can be
trained directly via policy gradient. Hence, the differentiation challenge
for discrete optimization can be naturally addressed, which leads to effective gradients and binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three
benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Embedding representation learning via neural networks is at the core foundation of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in developing algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for search efficiency this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per each query and trades off the search accuracy through binarization. To this end we consider the problem of directly learning a quantizable embedding representation and the sparse binary hash code end-to-end which can be used to construct an efficient hash table not only providing significant search reduction in the number of data but also achieving the state of the art search accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep metric learning methods. We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash code in a mini-batch can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum cost flow problem. Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to 98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search.

In hypercubic quantization applying a suitable (random or learned) rotation after dimensionality reduction has been experimentally shown to improve the results accuracy in the nearest neighbors search problem. We prove in this paper that the use of these rotations is optimal under some mild assumptions getting optimal binary sketches is equivalent to applying a rotation uniformizing the diagonal of the covariance matrix between data points. Moreover for two closed points the probability to have dissimilar binary sketches is upper bounded by a factor of the initial distance between the data points. Relaxing these assumptions we obtain a general concentration result for random matrices. We also provide some experiments illustrating these theoretical points and compare a set of algorithms in both the batch and online settings.</p>

To achieve this goal we propose a novel approach named BWNH to train Binary Weight Networks via Hashing. In this paper we first reveal the strong connection between inner-product preserving hashing and binary weight networks and show that training binary weight networks can be intrinsically regarded as a hashing problem. Based on this perspective we propose an alternating optimization method to learn the hash codes instead of directly learning binary weights. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our proposed BWNH outperforms current state-of-art by a large margin.</p>

	<td><p>Deep supervised hashing has emerged as an influential solution to large-scale semantic image retrieval problems in computer vision. In the light of recent progress convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning. However complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by similar/dissimilar labels which limits the retrieval performance. Generally pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard we propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code. Specifically a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian distribution is proposed which preserves semantic variations while penalizes the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes a two-step optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Moreover when training samples are limited our method surpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins.</p>

We design a hierarchical binary autoencoder to model the temporal dependencies in videos with multiple granularities, and embed the videos into binary codes with less computations than the stacked architecture. Then, we encourage the binary codes to simultaneously reconstruct the visual content and neighborhood structure of the videos.

However a major difficulty in deep hashing lies in the discrete constraints imposed on the network output which generally makes the optimization NP hard. In this work we adopt the greedy principle to tackle this NP hard problem by iteratively updating the network toward the probable optimal discrete solution in each iteration. A hash coding layer is designed to implement our approach which strictly uses the sign function in forward propagation to maintain the discrete constraints while in back propagation the gradients are transmitted intactly to the front layer to avoid the vanishing gradients.

However large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models.

	<td><p>Recently deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue in this paper we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However the cost of annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new domain. Moreover the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage could come from similar but different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented which mainly consists of four components a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses i.e. adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep hash models.</p>

	<td><p>Deep supervised hashing has become an active topic in information retrieval. It generates hashing bits by the output neurons of a deep hashing network. During binary discretization there often exists much redundancy between hashing bits that degenerates retrieval performance in terms of both storage and accuracy. This paper proposes a simple yet effective Neurons Merging Layer (NMLayer) for deep supervised hashing. A graph is constructed to represent the redundancy relationship between hashing bits that is used to guide the learning of a hashing network. Specifically it is dynamically learned by a novel mechanism defined in our active and frozen phases. According to the learned relationship the NMLayer merges the redundant neurons together to balance the importance of each output neuron. Moreover multiple NMLayers are progressively trained for a deep hashing network to learn a more compact hashing code from a long redundant code. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Learning compact binary codes for image retrieval task using deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention recently. However training deep hashing networks for the task is challenging due to the binary constraints on the hash codes the similarity preserving property and the requirement for a vast amount of labelled images. To the best of our knowledge none of the existing methods has tackled all of these challenges completely in a unified framework. In this work we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for the task in which the network is trained to produce binary codes directly from image pixels without the need of manual annotation. In particular to deal with the non-smoothness of binary constraints we propose a novel pairwise constrained loss function which simultaneously encodes the distances between pairs of hash codes and the binary quantization error. In order to train the network with the proposed loss function we propose an efficient parameter learning algorithm. In addition to provide similar / dissimilar training images to train the network we exploit 3D models reconstructed from unlabelled images for automatic generation of enormous training image pairs. The extensive experiments on image retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art compact representation methods on the image retrieval problem.</p>

Regarding the former requirement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proven to be a very powerful tool to extract highly discriminative local descriptors for effective image search. Additionally in order to further improve the discriminative power of the descriptors recent works adopt fine-tuned strategies. In this paper taking a different approach we propose a novel computationally efficient and competitive framework. Specifically we firstly propose various strategies to compute masks namely SIFT-mask SUM-mask and MAX-mask to select a representative subset of local convolutional features and eliminate redundant features. Our in-depth analyses demonstrate that proposed masking schemes are effective to address the burstiness drawback and improve retrieval accuracy. Secondly we propose to employ recent embedding and aggregating methods which can significantly boost the feature discriminability. Regarding the computation and storage efficiency we include a hashing module to produce very compact binary image representations. Extensive experiments on six image retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval performances.</p>

	<td><p>The research on hashing techniques for visual data is gaining increased attention in recent years due to the need for compact representations supporting efficient search/retrieval in large-scale databases such as online images. Among many possibilities Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring shortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and utilization of hash codes pushing a system to attain higher mAP will inevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of the hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples in the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not necessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper we introduce a new metric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation of the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a retrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash codes leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than conventional ones like mAP. To this end we start by mathematical analysis of the deficiencies of mAP for hashing-based retrieval. We then propose mLGAP and show why it is more appropriate for hashing-based retrieval. Experiments on image retrieval are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric.</p>

However the representation capacity of a single view is insufficient and some discriminative information is not captured which results in limited improvement. In this paper we employ multiple views to represent images and texts for enriching the feature information. Our framework exploits the complementary information among multiple views to better learn the discriminative compact hash codes. A discrete hashing learning framework that jointly performs classifier learning and subspace learning is proposed to complete multiple search tasks simultaneously. Our framework includes two stages namely a kernelization process and a quantization process. Kernelization aims to find a common subspace where multi-view features can be fused. The quantization stage is designed to learn discriminative unified hashing codes. Extensive experiments are performed on single-label datasets (WiKi and MMED) and multi-label datasets (MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE) and the experimental results indicate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>In social networks heterogeneous multimedia data correlate to each other such as videos and their corresponding tags in YouTube and image-text pairs in Facebook. Nearest neighbor retrieval across multiple modalities on large data sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an efficient solution since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise XOR operations can be fast handled the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing code length becomes longer the retrieval performance improvement becomes slower. In this paper we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR) for multimodal hashing. First the sigmoid function is used to embed the data matrices. Then the MCR is applied on the output of sigmoid function. As the output of sigmoid function approximates a binary code matrix the proposed MCR can efficiently decorrelate the hashing codes. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed method becomes greater as the code length increases.</p>

The spatial hashing is nearly minimal and our data structure is almost of the same size as the raw input. Compared with state-of-the-art octree-based methods our data structure significantly reduces the memory footprint during the CNN training.

A key design principle is a collection of Tgeq 1 hashing schemes with collision probabilities p_1ldots p_T such that sup_tin Tp_t(xy) = Theta(). This leads to a data-structure that approximates Z_w(y) using a sub-linear number of samples from each hash family. Using this new framework along with Distance Sensitive Hashing Aumuller Christiani Pagh Silvestri PODS18 we show that such a collection can be constructed and evaluated efficiently for any log-convex function w(xy)=e^phi(langle xyrangle) of the inner product on the unit sphere xyin ^d-1. Our method leads to data structures with sub-linear query time that significantly improve upon random sampling and can be used for Kernel Density or Partition Function Estimation. We provide extensions of our result from the sphere to ^d and from scalar functions to vector functions.</p>

	<td><p>With the large-scale explosion of images and videos over the internet efficient hashing methods have been developed to facilitate memory and time efficient retrieval of similar images. However none of the existing works uses hashing to address texture image retrieval mostly because of the lack of sufficiently large texture image databases. Our work addresses this problem by developing a novel deep learning architecture that generates binary hash codes for input texture images. For this we first pre-train a Texture Synthesis Network (TSN) which takes a texture patch as input and outputs an enlarged view of the texture by injecting newer texture content. Thus it signifies that the TSN encodes the learnt texture specific information in its intermediate layers. In the next stage a second network gathers the multi-scale feature representations from the TSNs intermediate layers using channel-wise attention combines them in a progressive manner to a dense continuous representation which is finally converted into a binary hash code with the help of individual and pairwise label information. The new enlarged texture patches also help in data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient texture data and are used to train the second stage of the network. Experiments on three public texture image retrieval datasets indicate the superiority of our texture synthesis guided hashing approach over current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Loosely speaking feature hashing uses a random sparse projection matrix A ^n to ^m (where m ll n) in order to reduce the dimension of the data from n to m while approximately preserving the Euclidean norm. Every column of A contains exactly one non-zero entry equals to either -1 or 1. Weinberger et al. showed tail bounds on Ax_2^2. Specifically they showed that for every varepsilon delta if x_infty / x_2 is sufficiently small and m is sufficiently large then Pr ; ;Ax_2^2 - x_2^2; &lt; varepsilon x_2^2 ; ge 1 - delta ;. These bounds were later extended by Dasgupta et al. (2010) and most recently refined by Dahlgaard et al. (2017) however the true nature of the performance of this key technique and specifically the correct tradeoff between the pivotal parameters x_infty / x_2 m varepsilon delta remained an open question. We settle this question by giving tight asymptotic bounds on the exact tradeoff between the central parameters thus providing a complete understanding of the performance of feature hashing. We complement the asymptotic bound with empirical data which shows that the constants hiding in the asymptotic notation are in fact very close to 1 thus further illustrating the tightness of the presented bounds in practice.</p>

In this paper we demonstrate that fuzzy hash functions can be learned in a novel minimax training framework and that these learned fuzzy hash functions outperform traditional fuzzy hash functions at the file similarity task for Portable Executable files. In our approach hash digests can be extracted from the kernel embeddings of two kernel networks trained in a minimax framework where the roles of players during training (i.e adversary versus generator) alternate along with the input data. We refer to this new minimax architecture as perturbation-consistent. The similarity score for a pair of files is the utility of the minimax game in equilibrium.

To induce the hash codes with semantics to the input-output pair cycle consistency loss is further proposed upon the adversarial training to strengthen the correlations between inputs and corresponding outputs. Our approach is generative to learn hash functions such that the learned hash codes can maximally correlate each input-output correspondence meanwhile can also regenerate the inputs so as to minimize the information loss. The learning to hash embedding is thus performed to jointly optimize the parameters of the hash functions across modalities as well as the associated generative models.

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of multimedia data (e.g. image audio and video etc.) on the web learning-based hashing techniques such as Deep Supervised Hashing (DSH) have proven to be very efficient for large-scale multimedia search. The recent successes seen in Learning-based hashing methods are largely due to the success of deep learning-based hashing methods. However there are some limitations to previous learning-based hashing methods (e.g. the learned hash codes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper we propose a novel learning-based hashing method named Deep Attention-guided Hashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea is to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the first stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of the hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing network). Specifically in the first network it leverages an attention network and hashing network to generate the attention-guided hash codes from the original images. The loss function we propose contains two components the semantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the attention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the second network these attention-guided hash codes are used to guide the training of the second hashing network (i.e. these codes are treated as supervised labels to train the second network). By doing this DAgH can make full use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the second hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true end-to-end fashion. Results from our experiments demonstrate that DAgH can generate high quality hash codes and it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet.</p>

However most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero-shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch-image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution respectively. As an important part of ZSIH we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge ZSIH is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets i.e. Sketchy and TU-Berlin with a novel zero-shot train-test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works.</p>

As a case study of a data-driven science workflow, we illustrate how

In this paper we propose a novel asymmetric supervised deep hashing method to preserve the semantic structure among different categories and generate the binary codes simultaneously. Specifically two asymmetric deep networks are constructed to reveal the similarity between each pair of images according to their semantic labels. The deep hash functions are then learned through two networks by minimizing the gap between the learned features and discrete codes. Furthermore since the binary codes in the Hamming space also should keep the semantic affinity existing in the original space another asymmetric pairwise loss is introduced to capture the similarity between the binary codes and real-value features. This asymmetric loss not only improves the retrieval performance but also contributes to a quick convergence at the training phase. By taking advantage of the two-stream deep structures and two types of asymmetric pairwise functions an alternating algorithm is designed to optimize the deep features and high-quality binary codes efficiently. Experimental results on three real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach as compared with state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years, many hashing methods have been proposed for the cross-modal retrieval task. However, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes, which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed, most of them are time-consuming. In addition, most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization, making them unscalable. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method—Scalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing, SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition, it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm, it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover, the binary codes can be generated discretely, reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset, making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely, Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, and NUS-WIDE, have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>

The primary contribution of this work is that two adversarial networks are leveraged to maximize the semantic correlation and consistency of the representations between different modalities. In addition we harness a self-supervised semantic network to discover high-level semantic information in the form of multi-label annotations. Such information guides the feature learning process and preserves the modality relationships in both the common semantic space and the Hamming space.

	<td><p>The recent advances in deep neural networks have demonstrated high capability in a wide variety of scenarios. Nevertheless, fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses, i.e., triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks, including cross-domain digits retrieval, image to image and image to video transfers, on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

Recently Minwise Hashing (or Minhash) and its related hashing algorithms have achieved great performances in large-scale image retrieval systems. However there are a large number of comparisons for image pairs in these applications which may spend a lot of computation time and affect the performance. In order to quickly obtain the pairwise images that theirs similarities are higher than the specific threshold T (e.g. 0.5) we propose a dynamic threshold filter of Minwise Hashing for image similarity measures. It greatly reduces the calculation time by terminating the unnecessary comparisons in advance. We also find that the filter can be extended to other hashing algorithms on when the estimator satisfies the binomial distribution such as b-Bit Minwise Hashing One Permutation Hashing etc. In this pager we use the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model based on the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to represent the image features. We have proved that the filter is correct and effective through the experiment on real image datasets.</p>

Nevertheless existing approaches could hardly guarantee a satisfactory performance with the extremely low-bit (e.g. 4-bit) hash codes due to the severe information loss and the shrink of the discrete solution space. In this paper we propose a novel strategy that is tailored for generating high-quality low-bit hash codes. The core idea is to jointly distill bit-specific and informative representations for a group of pre-defined code lengths. The learning of short hash codes among the group can benefit from the manifold shared with other long codes where multiple views from different hash codes provide the supplementary guidance and regularization making the convergence faster and more stable. To achieve that an asymmetric hashing framework with two variants of multi-head embedding structures is derived termed as Multi-head Asymmetric Hashing (MAH) leading to great efficiency of training and querying. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed MAH and have shown that the 8-bit hash codes generated by MAH achieve 94.3 of the MAP (Mean Average Precision (MAP)) score on the CIFAR-10 dataset which significantly surpasses the performance of the 48-bit codes by the state-of-the-arts in image retrieval tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Hash coding has been widely used in the approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Recently many deep hashing methods have been proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise similarity on the semantic-level labels where the pairwise similarity is generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is the pairwise similarity is 1 if they share no less than one class label and 0 if they do not share any. However such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper a new deep hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the pairwise similarity into an instance similarity where the instance similarity is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based on the instance similarity a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction and are efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Recent vision and learning studies show that learning compact hash codes can facilitate massive data processing
with significantly reduced storage and computation. Particularly, learning deep hash functions has greatly improved the retrieval
performance, typically under the semantic supervision. In contrast, current unsupervised deep hashing algorithms can hardly achieve
satisfactory performance due to either the relaxed optimization or absence of similarity-sensitive objective. In this work, we propose a
simple yet effective unsupervised hashing framework, named Similarity-Adaptive Deep Hashing (SADH), which alternatingly proceeds
over three training modules: deep hash model training, similarity graph updating and binary code optimization. The key difference from
the widely-used two-step hashing method is that the output representations of the learned deep model help update the similarity graph
matrix, which is then used to improve the subsequent code optimization. In addition, for producing high-quality binary codes, we devise
an effective discrete optimization algorithm which can directly handle the binary constraints with a general hashing loss. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of SADH, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large gaps.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed. Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable. However such unified or equal-length hash representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths. To mitigate these problems this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios. To this end a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH) is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios. More specifically MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn the modality-specific hash codes with different length settings while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices to semantically correlate the different hash representations for heterogeneous data comparable. As a result the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.</p>

Cross-view/cross-modal hashing for effective binary representation learning has received significant attention with exponentially growing availability of multimedia content. Most existing cross-view hashing algorithms emphasize the similarities in individual views which are then connected via cross-view similarities. In this work we focus on the exploitation of the discriminative information from different views and propose an end-to-end method to learn semantic-preserving and discriminative binary representation dubbed Discriminative Cross-View Hashing (DCVH) in light of learning multitasking binary representation for various tasks including cross-view retrieval image-to-image retrieval and image annotation/tagging. The proposed DCVH has the following key components. First it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) based nonlinear hashing functions and multilabel classification for both images and texts simultaneously. Such hashing functions achieve effective continuous relaxation during training without explicit quantization loss by using Direct Binary Embedding (DBE) layers. Second we propose an effective view alignment via Hamming distance minimization which is efficiently accomplished by bit-wise XOR operation. Extensive experiments on two image-text benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCVH outperforms state-of-the-art cross-view hashing algorithms as well as single-view image hashing algorithms. In addition DCVH can provide competitive performance for image annotation/tagging.</p>

To obtain better precision most studies focus on designing different objective functions with different constraints or penalty terms that consider neighborhood information. In this paper in contrast to existing hashing methods we propose a novel generalized framework called fusion hashing (FH) to improve the precision of existing hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed FH given an existing hashing method we first execute it several times to get several different hash codes for a set of training samples. We then propose two novel fusion strategies that combine these different hash codes into one set of final hash codes. Based on the final hash codes we learn a simple linear hash function for the samples that can significantly improve model precision. In general the proposed FH can be adopted in existing hashing method and achieve more precise and stable performance compared to the original hashing method with little extra expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments were performed based on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework</p>

The real images together with the synthetic ones

to discover the semantic relations. Extensive experiments on the widely-used image datasets demonstrate that PGH can significantly outperform stateof-the-art unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

With the rapid development of deep learning deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data but the training is difficult and less efficient because O(n^2) data pairs and O(n^3) triplets are involved. To address these issues we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. We first of all introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss thus reducing the complexity to O(n) and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss named Semantic Cluster Unary Loss (SCUL). The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters which means hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to be extended to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p>

common limitations of existing methods. First, most pioneer methods discretely learn hash codes bit by bit, making the learning
procedure rather time-consuming. Second, to reduce the large complexity of the n by n pairwise similarity matrix, most methods apply
sampling strategies during training, which inevitably results in information loss and suboptimal performance; some recent methods
try to replace the large matrix with a smaller one, but the size is
still large. Third, among the methods that leverage the pairwise
similarity matrix, most of them only encode the semantic label
information in learning the hash codes, failing to fully capture
the characteristics of data. In this paper, we present a novel supervised hashing method, called Fast Scalable Supervised Hashing
(FSSH), which circumvents the use of the large similarity matrix by
introducing a pre-computed intermediate term whose size is independent with the size of training data. Moreover, FSSH can learn

	<td><p>Maintaining the pair similarity relationship among originally high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional binary space is a popular strategy to learn binary codes. One simiple and intutive method is to utilize two identical code matrices produced by hash functions to approximate a pairwise real label matrix. However the resulting quartic problem is difficult to directly solve due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the objective. In this paper unlike previous optimization methods using various relaxation strategies we aim to directly solve the original quartic problem using a novel alternative optimization mechanism to linearize the quartic problem by introducing a linear regression model. Additionally we find that gradually learning each batch of binary codes in a sequential mode i.e. batch by batch is greatly beneficial to the convergence of binary code learning. Based on this significant discovery and the proposed strategy we introduce a scalable symmetric discrete hashing algorithm that gradually and smoothly updates each batch of binary codes. To further improve the smoothness we also propose a greedy symmetric discrete hashing algorithm to update each bit of batch binary codes. Moreover we extend the proposed optimization mechanism to solve the non-convex optimization problems for binary code learning in many other pairwise based hashing algorithms. Extensive experiments on benchmark single-label and multi-label databases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed mechanism over recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

One challenge stands out in solving the problem—set representation and measure of similarity. Particularly the query set and the sets in dataset collection can have varying cardinalities. The training collection is large enough such that linear scan is impractical. We propose a simple representation scheme that encodes both statistical and structural information of the sets. The derived representations are integrated in a kernel framework for flexible similarity measurement. For the query set process we adopt a learning-to-hash pipeline that turns the kernel representations into hash bits based on simple learners using multiple kernel learning. Experiments on two visual retrieval datasets show unambiguously that our set-to-set hashing framework outperforms prior methods that do not take the set-to-set search setting.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency cross-modal hashing~(CMH) has been widely used for cross-modal similarity search in multimedia applications. According to the training strategy existing CMH methods can be mainly divided into two categories relaxation-based continuous methods and discrete methods. In general the training of relaxation-based continuous methods is faster than discrete methods but the accuracy of relaxation-based continuous methods is not satisfactory. On the contrary the accuracy of discrete methods is typically better than relaxation-based continuous methods but the training of discrete methods is time-consuming. In this paper we propose a novel CMH method called discrete latent factor model based cross-modal hashing~(DLFH) for cross modal similarity search. DLFH is a discrete method which can directly learn the binary hash codes for CMH. At the same time the training of DLFH is efficient. Experiments on real datasets show that DLFH can achieve significantly better accuracy than existing methods and the training time of DLFH is comparable to that of relaxation-based continuous methods which are much faster than existing discrete methods.</p>

This work introduces an explicit embedding reducing manifold search to Euclidean search followed by dot product similarity search. This is equivalent to linear graph filtering of a sparse signal in the frequency domain. To speed up online search we compute an approximate Fourier basis of the graph offline.

Considering the difficulty in obtaining labeled datasets for image retrieval task in large scale we propose a novel CNN-based unsupervised hashing method namely Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH). The unsupervised hashing network is designed under the following three principles 1) more discriminative representations for image retrieval; 2) minimum quantization loss between the original real-valued feature descriptors and the learned hash codes; 3) maximum information entropy for the learned hash codes.

Therefore we propose an algorithm to learn a hash function from training images belonging to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen classes which can efficiently encode images of </code>unseen classes to binary codes. Specifically we project the image features from visual space and semantic features from semantic space into a common Hamming subspace.

In this work we use the max-margin classifier to learn an efficient hash function. To address the concern of domain-shift which may arise due to the introduction of new classes we also introduce an unsupervised domain adaptation model in the proposed hashing framework. Results on the three datasets show the advantage of using domain adaptation in learning a high-quality hash function and superiority of our method for the task of image retrieval performance as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently supervised hashing methods have attracted much attention since they can optimize retrieval speed and storage cost while preserving semantic information. Because hashing codes learning is NP-hard many methods resort to some form of relaxation technique. But the performance of these methods can easily deteriorate due to the relaxation. Luckily many supervised hashing formulations can be viewed as energy functions hence solving hashing codes is equivalent to learning marginals in the corresponding conditional random field (CRF). By minimizing the KL divergence between a fully factorized distribution and the Gibbs distribution of this CRF a set of consistency equations can be obtained but updating them in parallel may not yield a local optimum since the variational lower bound is not guaranteed to increase. In this paper we use a linear approximation of the sigmoid function to convert these consistency equations to linear systems which have a closed-form solution. By applying this novel technique to two classical hashing formulations KSH and SPLH we obtain two new methods called EM (energy minimizing based)-KSH and EM-SPLH. Experimental results on three datasets show the superiority of our methods.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing is a fundamental and one of the most successful hashing algorithm in the literature. Recent advances based on the idea of densification~ have shown that it is possible to compute k minwise hashes of a vector with d nonzeros in mere (d + k) computations a significant improvement over the classical O(dk). These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing especially when the data is sparse. In this paper we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal and without losing the runtime efficiency it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. Unsupervised cross-modal hashing is more flexible and applicable than supervised methods since no intensive labeling work is involved. However existing unsupervised methods learn hashing functions by preserving inter and intra correlations while ignoring the underlying manifold structure across different modalities which is extremely helpful to capture meaningful nearest neighbors of different modalities for cross-modal retrieval. To address the above problem in this paper we propose an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Cross-modal Hashing approach (UGACH) which makes full use of GANs ability for unsupervised representation learning to exploit the underlying manifold structure of cross-modal data. The main contributions can be summarized as follows (1) We propose a generative adversarial network to model cross-modal hashing in an unsupervised fashion. In the proposed UGACH given a data of one modality the generative model tries to fit the distribution over the manifold structure and select informative data of another modality to challenge the discriminative model. The discriminative model learns to distinguish the generated data and the true positive data sampled from correlation graph to achieve better retrieval accuracy. These two models are trained in an adversarial way to improve each other and promote hashing function learning. (2) We propose a correlation graph based approach to capture the underlying manifold structure across different modalities so that data of different modalities but within the same manifold can have smaller Hamming distance and promote retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>With the explosive growth of image databases deep hashing which learns compact binary descriptors for images has become critical for fast image retrieval. Many existing deep hashing methods leverage quantization loss defined as distance between the features before and after quantization to reduce the error from binarizing features. While minimizing the quantization loss guarantees that quantization has minimal effect on retrieval accuracy it unfortunately significantly reduces the expressiveness of features even before the quantization. In this paper we show that the above definition of quantization loss is too restricted and in fact not necessary for maintaining high retrieval accuracy. We therefore propose a new form of quantization loss measured in triplets. The core idea of the triplet quantization loss is to learn discriminative real-valued descriptors which lead to minimal loss on retrieval accuracy after quantization. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark data sets of different scales CIFAR-10 and In-shop demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. Moreover we show that the compact binary descriptors obtained with triplet quantization loss lead to very small performance drop after quantization.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest
neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can
lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of annotating
data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing
to a new domain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the
robustness problem as the data at training and test stage
may come from different distributions. This paper studies
the exploration of generating synthetic data through semisupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which
leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data
to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance
and global coherence, for better understanding statistical
structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above
two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic
hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented, which mainly
consists of four components: a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary
stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash
stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and
a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained endto-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e., adversarial loss
to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet
ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the
input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify
each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on
both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our
framework also achieves superior results when compared to
state-of-the-art deep hash models.</p>

We provide a parallel C++ implementation called BBhash. It is capable of creating a minimal perfect hash function of 10^10 elements in less than 7 minutes using 8 threads and 5 GB of memory and the resulting function uses 3.7 bits/element.

However because of the particular challenges of mobile visual search achieving a high recognition bitrate has becomes a consistent target of previous related works. In this paper we propose a few-parameter low-latency and high-accuracy deep hashing approach for constructing binary hash codes for mobile visual search. First we exploit the architecture of the MobileNet model which significantly decreases the latency of deep feature extraction by reducing the number of model parameters while maintaining accuracy. Second we add a hash-like layer into MobileNet to train the model on labeled mobile visual data. Evaluations show that the proposed system can exceed state-of-the-art accuracy performance in terms of the MAP. More importantly the memory consumption is much less than that of other deep learning models. The proposed method requires only 13 MB of memory for the neural network and achieves a MAP of 97.80 on the mobile location recognition dataset used for testing.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years deep neural networks have emerged as a dominant machine learning tool for a wide variety of application domains. However training a deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data which is an expensive process in terms of time labor and human expertise. Domain adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging labeled data in a different but related source domain to develop a model for the target domain. Further the explosive growth of digital data has posed a fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency recent years have witnessed a wide application of hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper we first introduce a new dataset Office-Home to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms. The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge this is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain adaptation.</p>

	<td><p>Recently with the enormous growth of online videos fast video retrieval research has received increasing attention. As an extension of image hashing techniques traditional video hashing methods mainly depend on hand-crafted features and transform the real-valued features into binary hash codes. As videos provide far more diverse and complex visual information than images extracting features from videos is much more challenging than that from images. Therefore high-level semantic features to represent videos are needed rather than low-level hand-crafted methods. In this paper a deep convolutional neural network is proposed to extract high-level semantic features and a binary hash function is then integrated into this framework to achieve an end-to-end optimization. Particularly our approach also combines triplet loss function which preserves the relative similarity and difference of videos and classification loss function as the optimization objective. Experiments have been performed on two public datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art video retrieval methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel framework where feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically our joint optimization produces aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition we also propose a fast version of the recently-proposed Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed framework.

Our experiments show that the proposed method can achieve competitive results comparable to neural embedding learning techniques however with only a fraction of the computational complexity of these methods. While the proposed derandomization enhances the computational and space complexity of our method the possibility of applying weighting methods such as positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) to our models after their construction (and at a reduced dimensionality) imparts a high discriminatory power to the resulting embeddings. Obviously this method comes with other known benefits of random projection-based techniques such as ease of update.</p>

None of the traditionally used hash tables have this property. We show how known approaches like linear probing and bucket cuckoo hashing can be adapted to this scenario by subdividing them into many subtables or using virtual memory overcommitting. However these rather straightforward solutions suffer from slow amortized insertion times due to frequent reallocation in small increments. Our main result is DySECT (bf Dynamic bf Space bf Efficient bf Cuckoo bf Table) which avoids these problems. DySECT consists of many subtables which grow by doubling their size. The resulting inhomogeneity in subtable sizes is equalized by the flexibility available in bucket cuckoo hashing where each element can go to several buckets each of which containing several cells. Experiments indicate that DySECT works well with load factors up to 98. With up to 2.7 times better performance than the next best solution.</p>

	<td><p>We present hash embeddings an efficient method for representing words in a continuous vector form. A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented by k d-dimensional embeddings vectors and one k dimensional weight vector. The final d dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of B embedding vectors. Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.</p>

However training deep hashing networks is challenging due to the binary constraints on the hash codes. In this paper we propose deep network models and learning algorithms for learning binary hash codes given image representations under both unsupervised and supervised manners. The novelty of our network design is that we constrain one hidden layer to directly output the binary codes. This design has overcome a challenging problem in some previous works optimizing non-smooth objective functions because of binarization. In addition we propose to incorporate independence and balance properties in the direct and strict forms into the learning schemes. We also include a similarity preserving property in our objective functions. The resulting optimizations involving these binary independence and balance constraints are difficult to solve. To tackle this difficulty we propose to learn the networks with alternating optimization and careful relaxation. Furthermore by leveraging the powerful capacity of convolutional neural networks we propose an end-to-end architecture that jointly learns to extract visual features and produce binary hash codes. Experimental results for the benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods compare favorably or outperform the state of the art.</p>

Such hash functions have numerous applications but often there is a need to optimize the choice of the distribution of v. In the present work we focus on so-called anti-concentration bounds i.e. the upper bounds of left&lt;vx &lt; alpha right. In many applications v is a vector of independent random variables with standard normal distribution. In such case the distribution of &lt;vx is also normal and it is easy to approximate left&lt;vx &lt; alpha right. Here we consider two bounded distributions in the context of the anti-concentration bounds. Particularly we analyze v being a random vector from the unit ball in l_infty and v being a random vector from the unit sphere in l_2. We show optimal up to a constant anti-concentration measures for functions f(x)=&lt;vx. As a consequence of our research we obtain new best results for newline for l_p in high dimensional space for all pin1infty for c=Omega(maxd^1/p). These results improve over those presented in 16. Finally our paper reports progress on answering the open problem by Pagh~17 who considered the nearest neighbor search without false negatives for the Hamming distance.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is a basic tool for dimensionality reduction employed in several aspects of machine learning. However the perfomance analysis is often carried out under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function is used without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured input. In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing namely similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et al. NIPS12 and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. ICML09 both of which have found numerous applications i.e. in approximate near-neighbour search with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM. We consider the recent mixed tabulation hash function of Dahlgaard et al. FOCS15 which was proved theoretically to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications including the above OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar when the input vectors are sparse. Our main contribution however is an experimental comparison of different hashing schemes when used inside FH OPH and LSH. We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the classic multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work well on sufficiently random data but we demonstrate that in the above applications it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and synthetic data. We also compare with the very popular MurmurHash3 which has no proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to truly random hashing in our experiments. However mixed tabulation was 40 faster than MurmurHash3 and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on all possible input making it more reliable.</p>

	<td><p>As the amount of textual data has been rapidly increasing over
the past decade, efficient similarity search methods have become
a crucial component of large-scale information retrieval systems.
A popular strategy is to represent original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of machine learning methods have been utilized, but they often lack expressiveness
and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The
recent advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications
has demonstrated its capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex data. Especially, deep generative
models naturally combine the expressiveness of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural networks,
which is very suitable for text modeling. However, little work has
leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing. In this paper, we propose a series of novel deep document generative models for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides a principled framework for model extension, uncertainty estimation, simulation, and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization, the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is widely applied to large-scale image retrieval due to the storage and retrieval efficiency. Existing work on deep hashing assumes that the database in the target domain is identically distributed with the training set in the source domain. This paper relaxes this assumption to a transfer retrieval setting which allows the database and the training set to come from different but relevant domains. However the transfer retrieval setting will introduce two technical difficulties first the hash model trained on the source domain cannot work well on the target domain due to the large distribution gap; second the domain gap makes it difficult to concentrate the database points to be within a small Hamming ball. As a consequence transfer retrieval performance within Hamming Radius 2 degrades significantly in existing hashing methods. This paper presents Transfer Adversarial Hashing (TAH) a new hybrid deep architecture that incorporates a pairwise t-distribution cross-entropy loss to learn concentrated hash codes and an adversarial network to align the data distributions between the source and target domains. TAH can generate compact transfer hash codes for efficient image retrieval on both source and target domains. Comprehensive experiments validate that TAH yields state of the art Hamming space retrieval performance on standard datasets.</p>

This work presents HashNet a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training until it eventually goes back to being the original difficult to optimize deep network with the sign activation function. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that HashNet can generate exactly binary hash codes and yield state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

Particularly, ranking-based hashing techniques have recently attracted broad research attention because ranking accuracy among the retrieved data is well explored and their objective is more applicable to realistic search tasks. However, directly optimizing discrete hash codes without continuous-relaxations on a nonlinear ranking objective is infeasible by either traditional optimization methods or even recent discrete hashing algorithms. To address this challenging issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised hashing method, dubbed Discrete Semantic Ranking Hashing (DSeRH), which aims to directly embed semantic rank orders into binary codes. In DSeRH, a generalized Adaptive Discrete Minimization (ADM) approach is proposed to discretely optimize binary codes with the quadratic nonlinear ranking objective in an iterative manner and is guaranteed to converge quickly. Additionally, instead of using 0/1 independent labels to form rank orders as in previous works, we generate the listwise rank orders from the high-level semantic word embeddings which can quantitatively capture the intrinsic correlation between different categories. We evaluate our DSeRH, coupled with both linear and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) hash functions, on three image datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, SUN397 and ImageNet100, and the results manifest that DSeRH can outperform the state-of-the-art ranking-based hashing methods.</p>

Cross-modal hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting semantic correlations across different modalities. Existing cross-modal hashing methods first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors, and then generate binary codes by another separate quantization step. However, suboptimal hash codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes.
This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal hashing, which jointly learns good data representation tailored to hash coding and formally controls the quantization error. The proposed CHN is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good image representations, a multilayer perception for learning good text representations, two hashing layers for generating compact binary codes, and a structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical study shows that CHN yields state of the art cross-modal retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

However there are serious flaws in the evaluations of existing deep hashing papers (1) The datasets they used are too small and simple to simulate the real CBIR situation. (2) They did not correctly include the search time in their evaluation criteria while the search time is crucial in real CBIR systems. (3) The performance of some unsupervised hashing algorithms (e.g. LSH) can easily be boosted if one uses multiple hash tables which is an important factor should be considered in the evaluation while most of the deep hashing papers failed to do so.

	<td><p>Mobile landmark search (MLS) recently receives increasing attention for its great practical values. However it still remains unsolved due to two important challenges. One is high bandwidth consumption of query transmission and the other is the huge visual variations of query images sent from mobile devices. In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme named as canonical view based discrete multi-modal hashing (CV-DMH) to handle these problems via a novel three-stage learning procedure. First a submodular function is designed to measure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it canonical views which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited redundancy are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy. Second multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from multiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and adaptively characterize visual contents of varied landmark images with certain canonical views. Finally compact binary codes are learned on intermediate representation within a tailored discrete binary embedding model which preserves visual relations of images measured with canonical views and removes the involved noises. In this part we develop a new augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) based optimization method to directly solve the discrete binary codes. We can not only explicitly deal with the discrete constraint but also consider the bit-uncorrelated constraint and balance constraint together. Experiments on real world landmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CV-DMH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>One of the most challenging tasks in large-scale multi-label image retrieval is to map images into binary codes while preserving multilevel semantic similarity. Recently, several deep supervised hashing methods have been proposed to learn hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity with deep convolutional neural networks. However, these triplet label based methods try to preserve the ranking order of images according to their similarity degrees to the queries while not putting direct constraints on the distance between the codes of very similar images. Besides, the current evaluation criteria are not able to measure the performance of existing hashing methods on preserving fine-grained multilevel semantic similarity. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Deep Multilevel Semantic Similarity Preserving Hashing (DMSSPH) method to learn compact similarity-preserving binary codes for the huge body of multi-label image data with deep convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we make the best of the supervised information in the form of pairwise labels to maximize the discriminability of output binary codes. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods at the accuracies of top returned images, especially for shorter binary codes. Meanwhile, the proposed method shows better performance on preserving fine-grained multilevel semantic similarity according to the results under the Jaccard coefficient based evaluation criteria we propose.</p>

	<td><p>We present hash embeddings an efficient method for representing words in a continuous vector form. A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented by k d-dimensional embeddings vectors and one k dimensional weight vector. The final d dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of B embedding vectors. Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.</p>

	<td><p>As the rapid growth of multi-modal data hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval have received considerable attention. Deep-networks-based cross-modal hashing methods are appealing as they can integrate feature learning and hash coding into end-to-end trainable frameworks. However it is still challenging to find content similarities between different modalities of data due to the heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem we propose an adversarial hashing network with attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on informative parts of multi-modal data. The proposed new adversarial network HashGAN consists of three building blocks 1) the feature learning module to obtain feature representations 2) the generative attention module to generate an attention mask which is used to obtain the attended (foreground) and the unattended (background) feature representations 3) the discriminative hash coding module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework the generative module and the discriminative module are trained in an adversarial way the generator is learned to make the discriminator cannot preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the background feature representations while the discriminator aims to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. both the foreground and the background feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HashGAN brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Retrieving nearest neighbors across correlated data in multiple modalities such as image-text pairs on Facebook and video-tag pairs on YouTube has become a challenging task due to the huge amount of data. Multimodal hashing methods that embed data into binary codes can boost the retrieving speed and reduce storage requirement. As unsupervised multimodal hashing methods are usually inferior to supervised ones while the supervised ones requires too much manually labeled data the proposed method in this paper utilizes a part of labels to design a semi-supervised multimodal hashing method. It first computes the transformation matrices for data matrices and label matrix. Then with these transformation matrices fuzzy logic is introduced to estimate a label matrix for unlabeled data. Finally it uses the estimated label matrix to learn hashing functions for data in each modality to generate a unified binary code matrix. Experiments show that the proposed semi-supervised method with 50 labels can get a medium performance among the compared supervised ones and achieve an approximate performance to the best supervised method with 90 labels. With only 10 labels the proposed method can still compete with the worst compared supervised one.</p>

	<td><p>Hash codes are efficient data representations for coping with the ever growing amounts of data. In this paper we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests with near-optimal information-theoretic code aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme where random trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 for the visited tree leaf and </code>0 for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class distance for the two random class groups. Finally we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets while performing at the level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while utilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation. This work proposes a principled and robust procedure to train and deploy in parallel an ensemble of light-weight CNNs instead of simply going deeper.</p>

Each triplet sample contains two pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity and one pedestrian image (or part) of the different identity.

To achieve these two goals we introduce the multi-index hashing (MIH) mechanism into the proposed deep architecture which divides the binary codes into multiple substrings. Due to the non-uniformly distributed codes will result in inefficiency searching we add the two balanced constraints at feature-level and instance-level respectively.

	<td><p>Zero-shot Hashing (ZSH) is to learn hashing models for novel/target classes without training data which is an important and challenging problem. Most existing ZSH approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate shared semantic representations between the seen/source classes and novel/target classes. However due to having disjoint the hash functions learned from the source dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. In this paper we study the transductive ZSH i.e. we have unlabeled data for novel classes. We put forward a simple yet efficient joint learning approach via coarse-to-fine similarity mining which transfers knowledges from source data to target data. It mainly consists of two building blocks in the proposed deep architecture 1) a shared two-streams network which the first stream operates on the source data and the second stream operates on the unlabeled data to learn the effective common image representations and 2) a coarse-to-fine module which begins with finding the most representative images from target classes and then further detect similarities among these images to transfer the similarities of the source data to the target data in a greedy fashion. Extensive evaluation results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Min-Hash is a popular technique for efficiently estimating the Jaccard similarity of binary sets. Consistent Weighted Sampling (CWS) generalizes the Min-Hash scheme to sketch weighted sets and has drawn increasing interest from the community. Due to its constant-time complexity independent of the values of the weights Improved CWS (ICWS) is considered as the state-of-the-art CWS algorithm. In this paper we revisit ICWS and analyze its underlying mechanism to show that there actually exists dependence between the two components of the hash-code produced by ICWS which violates the condition of independence. To remedy the problem we propose an Improved ICWS (I^2CWS) algorithm which not only shares the same theoretical computational complexity as ICWS but also abides by the required conditions of the CWS scheme. The experimental results on a number of synthetic data sets and real-world text data sets demonstrate that our I^2CWS algorithm can estimate the Jaccard similarity more accurately and also compete with or outperform the compared methods including ICWS in classification and top-K retrieval after relieving the underlying dependence.</p>

This work presents Deep Product Quantization (DPQ) a technique that leads to more accurate retrieval and classification than the latest state of the art methods while having similar computational complexity and memory footprint as the Product Quantization method. To our knowledge this is the first work to introduce a dictionary-based representation that is inspired by Product Quantization and which is learned end-to-end and thus benefits from the supervised signal.

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed extensive attention in binary code learning a.k.a. hashing for nearest neighbor search problems. It has been seen that high-dimensional data points can be quantized into binary codes to give an efficient similarity approximation via Hamming distance. Among existing schemes ranking-based hashing is recent promising that targets at preserving ordinal relations of ranking in the Hamming space to minimize retrieval loss. However the size of the ranking tuples which shows the ordinal relations is quadratic or cubic to the size of training samples. By given a large-scale training data set it is very expensive to embed such ranking tuples in binary code learning. Besides it remains a dificulty to build ranking tuples efficiently for most ranking-preserving hashing which are deployed over an ordinal graph-based setting. To handle these problems we propose a novel ranking-preserving hashing method dubbed Ordinal Constraint Hashing (OCH) which efficiently learns the optimal hashing functions with a graph-based approximation to embed the ordinal relations. The core idea is to reduce the size of ordinal graph with ordinal constraint projection which preserves the ordinal relations through a small data set (such as clusters or random samples). In particular to learn such hash functions effectively we further relax the discrete constraints and design a specific stochastic gradient decent algorithm for optimization. Experimental results on three large-scale visual search benchmark datasets i.e. LabelMe Tiny100K and GIST1M show that the proposed OCH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p>

However how to learn deep representations that strongly preserve similarities between data pairs and can be accurately quantized via vector quantization remains a challenging task. Existing methods simply leverage quantization loss and similarity loss which result in unexpectedly biased back-propagating gradients and affect the search performances. To this end we propose a novel gradient snapping layer (GSL) to directly regularize the back-propagating gradient towards a neighboring codeword the generated gradients are un-biased for reducing similarity loss and also propel the learned representations to be accurately quantized. Joint deep representation and vector quantization learning can be easily performed by alternatively optimize the quantization codebook and the deep neural network. The proposed framework is compatible with various existing vector quantization approaches.

In particular SMFH employs a well-designed binary code learning algorithm to preserve the similarities among multi-modal original features through a graph regularization. At the same time semantic labels when available are incorporated into the learning procedure. We conjecture that all these would facilitate to preserve the most relevant information during the binary quantization process and hence improve the retrieval accuracy.

State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a set and use specific distance measure to compare two sets. These methods are slow to compute and not compact to use in a large scale scenario. Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be used to efficiently compare two samples. However most hashing methods encode each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same set represent the same object or person. We investigate the set hashing problem by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image features then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming set similarity relations using class labels. We extensively evaluate our approach on datasets used for image matching and show highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a feature representation which is built as a combination of three local descriptors.

	<td><p>In supervised binary hashing one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem nonconvex and nonsmooth because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training solving a continuous optimization and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results but the hash function was still learned a posteriori which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as an iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.</p>

	<td><p>One of the basic tasks in bioinformatics is localizing a short subsequence S read while sequencing in a long reference sequence R like the human geneome. A natural rapid approach would be finding a hash value for S and compare it with a prepared database of hash values for each of length S subsequences of R. The problem with such approach is that it would only spot a perfect match while in reality there are lots of small changes substitutions deletions and insertions. This issue could be repaired if having a hash function designed to tolerate some small distortion accordingly to an alignment metric (like Needleman-Wunch) designed to make that two similar sequences should most likely give the same hash value. This paper discusses construction of Distortion-Resistant Hashing (DRH) to generate such fingerprints for rapid search of similar subsequences. The proposed approach is based on the rate distortion theory in a nearly uniform subset of length S sequences the hash value represents the closest sequence to S. This gives some control of the distance of collisions sequences having the same hash value.</p>

	<td><p>Given a large dataset of binary codes and a binary query point we address how to efficiently find K codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine similarities to the query. The straightforward answer to this problem is to compare the query with all items in the dataset but this is practical only for small datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the nearest neighbors. However if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance then the main issue is that the order of buckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue we first elaborate on the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table. However solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only practical for short binary codes. To address this issue we propose the angular multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash tables on binary code substrings. The proposed search algorithm solves the exact angular K nearest neighbor problem in a time that is often orders of magnitude faster than the linear scan baseline and even approximation methods.</p>

	<td><p>This paper considers the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search in the compressed domain. We introduce polysemous codes which offer both the distance estimation quality of product quantization and the efficient comparison of binary codes with Hamming distance. Their design is inspired by algorithms introduced in the 90s to construct channel-optimized vector quantizers. At search time this dual interpretation accelerates the search. Most of the indexed vectors are filtered out with Hamming distance letting only a fraction of the vectors to be ranked with an asymmetric distance estimator. The method is complementary with a coarse partitioning of the feature space such as the inverted multi-index. This is shown by our experiments performed on several public benchmarks such as the BIGANN dataset comprising one billion vectors for which we report state-of-the-art results for query times below 0.3millisecond per core. Last but not least our approach allows the approximate computation of the k-NN graph associated with the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M described by CNN image descriptors in less than 8 hours on a single machine.</p>

We then propose two alternative protocols for supervised hashing one based on retrieval on a disjoint set of classes and another based on transfer learning to new classes.

	<td><p>Hashing methods have attracted much attention for large scale image retrieval. Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently. However existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one hand a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to the discrete Hamming distance which raises a critical issue of image retrieval where fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand different hash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently and treating them equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the above two problems we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH) approach which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by weighted Hamming distance. First a novel deep hashing network is proposed to learn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly so that the learned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different image classes. Second a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed which rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing its semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image retrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance which can provide more accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance. Experiments on four widely used datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms eight state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing methods have been widely used for efficient similarity retrieval on large scale image database. Traditional hashing methods learn hash functions to generate binary codes from hand-crafted features which achieve limited accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently several deep hashing methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate more discriminative feature representations. However these deep hashing methods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios which only exploit the semantic similarity information but ignore the underlying data structures. In this paper we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach to perform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving semantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are as follows (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the empirical error on labeled data as well as the embedding error on both labeled and unlabeled data which can preserve the semantic similarity and capture the meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing. (2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit both labeled and unlabeled data in which we propose an online graph construction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training to better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge the proposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash code learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion. Experimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps: bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes, followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space, allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds, or vice-versa. In our experiments over two standard image datasets we find statistically significant increases in retrieval effectiveness versus a host of state-of-the-art data-dependent and independent hashing models.</p>

The embedded vectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated to form a single representation for image retrieval. Second in order to make the proposed embedding method applicable to large scale problem we further derive its fast version in which the embedded vectors can be efficiently computed i.e. in the closed-form. We compare the proposed embedding methods with the state of the art in the context of image search under various settings when the images are represented by medium length vectors short vectors or binary vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed embedding methods outperform existing the state of the art on the standard public image retrieval benchmarks.</p>

The first one is Nested Invariance Pooling (NIP) a method inspired from i-theory a mathematical theory for computing group invariant transformations with feed-forward neural networks. NIP is able to produce compact and well-performing descriptors with visual representations extracted from convolutional neural networks. We specifically incorporate scale translation and rotation invariances but the scheme can be extended to any arbitrary sets of transformations. We also show that using moments of increasing order throughout nesting is important. The NIP descriptors are then hashed to the target code size (32-256 bits) with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine with a novel batch-level regularization scheme specifically designed for the purpose of hashing (RBMH). A thorough empirical evaluation with state-of-the-art shows that the results obtained both with the NIP descriptors and the NIP+RBMH hashes are consistently outstanding across a wide range of datasets.</p>

Storage efficiency is achieved by converting the fixed-length hash code into a variable-length code. Search efficiency is obtained by using a multiple hash table structure. With VLH we are able to deliberately add redundancy into hash codes to improve retrieval performance with little sacrifice in storage efficiency or search complexity.

In this paper for the first time we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing through residual learning termed Deep Residual Hashing (DRH) for an end-to-end simultaneous representation learning and hash coding.

	<td><p>The method of random projections has become a standard tool for machine learning data mining and search with massive data at Web scale. The effective use of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing (real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper we focus on a simple 2-bit coding scheme. In particular we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of data similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important practical applications. For example in the task of near neighbor search a crucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data similarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash table techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed coding scheme and estimator. As a related task in this paper we also study a simple uniform quantization scheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our analysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For example when the target similarity level is high 2 or 3 bits might be sufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high it is preferable to use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good choice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash tables. Combining these results we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be recommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation. Extensive experimental results are provided.</p>

	<td><p>We investigate the problem of image retrieval based on visual queries when the latter comprise arbitrary regions-of-interest (ROI) rather than entire images. Our proposal is a compact image descriptor that combines the state-of-the-art in content-based descriptor extraction with a multi-level Voronoi-based spatial partitioning of each dataset image. The proposed multi-level Voronoi-based encoding uses a spatial hierarchical K-means over interest-point locations and computes a content-based descriptor over each cell. In order to reduce the matching complexity with minimal or no sacrifice in retrieval performance (i) we utilize the tree structure of the spatial hierarchical K-means to perform a top-to-bottom pruning for local similarity maxima; (ii) we propose a new image similarity score that combines relevant information from all partition levels into a single measure for similarity; (iii) we combine our proposal with a novel and efficient approach for optimal bit allocation within quantized descriptor representations. By deriving both a Voronoi-based VLAD descriptor (termed as Fast-VVLAD) and a Voronoi-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptor (termed as Fast-VDCNN) we demonstrate that our Voronoi-based framework is agnostic to the descriptor basis and can easily be slotted into existing frameworks. Via a range of ROI queries in two standard datasets it is shown that the Voronoi-based descriptors achieve comparable or higher mean Average Precision against conventional grid-based spatial search while offering more than two-fold reduction in complexity. Finally beyond ROI queries we show that Voronoi partitioning improves the geometric invariance of compact CNN descriptors thereby resulting in competitive performance to the current state-of-the-art on whole image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient hard sample mining is usually employed with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.</p>

Our method decomposes the training process into independent layer-wise local updates through auxiliary variables. Empirically we observe that our training algorithm always converges and its computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the networks. Empirically we manage to train DNNs with 64 hidden layers and 1024 nodes per layer for supervised hashing in about 3 hours using a single GPU. Our proposed very deep supervised hashing (VDSH) method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.</p>

However most existing methods represent a video by either aggregating or projecting all its frames into a single datum point which may easily cause severe information loss. In this paper we propose an efficient QBIVR framework to enable an effective and efficient video search with image query. We first define a similarity-preserving distance metric between an image and its orthogonal projection in the subspace of the video which can be equivalently transformed to a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Besides to boost the efficiency of solving the MIPS problem we propose two asymmetric hashing schemes which bridge the domain gap of images and videos. The first approach termed Inner-product Binary Coding (IBC) preserves the inner relationships of images and videos in a common Hamming space. To further improve the retrieval efficiency we devise a Bilinear Binary Coding (BBC) approach which employs compact bilinear projections instead of a single large projection matrix. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four real-world video datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches as compared to the state-of-the-arts.</p>

Building on the recent theoretical CoveringLSH construction that eliminates false negatives we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for Hamming space called . Inheriting the design benefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports all near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic improvement to the hash function computation time from (dL) to (d + L) where d is the dimensionality of data and L is the number of hash tables. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that is comparable (and often superior) to traditional hashing-based approaches for search radius up to 20 in high-dimensional Hamming space.</p>

In ITQ+ a new slack function is learned from auxiliary data to approximate the quantization error in ITQ.

However hash codes significantly depend on the dissimilarity which prohibits users from adjusting the dissimilarity at query time. In this paper we propose multiple purpose LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash codes for different dissimilarities. mp-LSH supports L2 cosine and inner product dissimilarities and their corresponding weighted sums where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus mp-LSH enables us for example to retrieve similar items to a query with the user preference taken into account to find a similar material to a query with some properties (stability utility etc.) optimized and to turn on or off a part of multi-modal information (brightness color audio text etc.) in image/video retrieval. We theoretically and empirically analyze the performance of three variants of mp-LSH and demonstrate their usefulness on real-world data sets.</p>

Supervised knowledge e.g. semantic labels or pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However confronted with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the Web existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual labelling. In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme termed (ZSH) which compresses images of unseen categories to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of seen categories. Specifically we project independent data labels i.e. 0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space where semantic relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover in order to cope with the semantic shift problem we rotate the embedded space to more suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime to exert positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions we further propose to preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes. Besides we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

For image retrieval deep-networks-based hashing methods are appealing since they can simultaneously learn effective image representations and compact hash codes. This paper focuses on deep-networks-based hashing for multi-label images each of which may contain objects of multiple categories. In most existing hashing methods each image is represented by one piece of hash code which is referred to as semantic hashing. This setting may be suboptimal for multi-label image retrieval. To solve this problem we propose a deep architecture that learns image representations for multi-label image data which are organized in multiple groups with each group containing the features for one category. The instance-aware representations not only bring advantages to semantic hashing but also can be used in category-aware hashing in which an image is represented by multiple pieces of hash codes and each piece of code corresponds to a category. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that for both semantic hashing and category-aware hashing the proposed method shows substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>By leveraging semantic (label) information, supervised hashing has demonstrated better accuracy than unsupervised hashing in many real applications. Because the hashing-code learning problem is essentially a discrete optimization problem which is hard to solve, most existing supervised hashing methods try to solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by dropping the discrete constraints.
However, these methods typically suffer from poor performance due to the errors caused by the relaxation. Some other methods try to directly solve the discrete optimization problem. However, they are typically time-consuming and unscalable. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called column sampling based discrete supervised hashing (COSDISH), to directly learn the discrete hashing code from semantic information.
COSDISH is an iterative method, in each iteration of which several columns are sampled from the semantic similarity matrix and then the hashing code is decomposed into two parts which can be alternately optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the storage and retrieval efficiency, hashing has been widely deployed to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimedia retrieval. Supervised hashing, which improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs, has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval, an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features, followed by another separate quantization step that generates binary codes.
However, suboptimal hash coding may be produced, because the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the binary coding. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Hashing Network (DHN) architecture for supervised hashing, in which we jointly learn good image representation tailored to hash coding and formally control the quantization error.
The DHN model constitutes four key components: (1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture image representations; (2) a fully-connected hashing layer to generate compact binary hash codes; (3) a pairwise cross-entropy loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a pairwise quantization loss for controlling hashing quality. Extensive experiments on standard image retrieval datasets show the proposed DHN model yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search technique for high-dimensional feature indexing and retrieval is the crux of large-scale image retrieval. A recent promising technique is Product Quantization which attempts to index high-dimensional image features by decomposing the feature space into a Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and quantizing each of them separately. Despite the promising results reported their quantization approach follows the typical hard assignment of traditional quantization methods which may result in large quantization errors and thus inferior search performance. Unlike the existing approaches in this paper we propose a novel approach called Sparse Product Quantization (SPQ) to encoding the high-dimensional feature vectors into sparse representation. We optimize the sparse representations of the feature vectors by minimizing their quantization errors making the resulting representation is essentially close to the original data in practice. Experiments show that the proposed SPQ technique is not only able to compress data but also an effective encoding technique. We obtain state-of-the-art results for ANN search on four public image datasets and the promising results of content-based image retrieval further validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

The empirical results also demonstrate that the NGMM kernel typically outperforms the GInt kernel. Interestingly the NGMM kernel has another interpretation --- it is the</code>asymmetrically transformed version of the GInt kernel based on the idea of ``asymmetric hashing.

Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable but it also improves over the more complex coupled objective function and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-based image hashing represents crucial technique for visual data storage reduction and expedited image search. Conventional hashing schemes typically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions which separates the procedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and non-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image classification and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks. On all benchmarks our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular our algorithm achieves a near-perfect 0.99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy with only 12 bits on MNIST and a new record of 0.74 on the CIFAR10 dataset. In comparison the best accuracies obtained on CIFAR10 by existing hashing algorithms without or with deep networks are known to be 0.36 and 0.58 respectively.</p>

The resource bottleneck with WMH is the computation of multiple (typically a few hundreds to thousands) independent hashes of the data. We propose a simple rejection type sampling scheme based on a carefully designed red-green map where we show that the number of rejected sample has exactly the same distribution as weighted minwise sampling. The running time of our method for many practical datasets is an order of magnitude smaller than existing methods. Experimental evaluations on real datasets show that for computing 500 WMH our proposal can be 60000x faster than the Ioffes method without losing any accuracy. Our method is also around 100x faster than approximate heuristics capitalizing on the efficient ``densified one permutation hashing schemes~. Given the simplicity of our approach and its significant advantages we hope that it will replace existing implementations in practice.</p>

Existing work on cross-modal hashing assumes heterogeneous relationship across modalities for hash function learning. In this paper we relax the strong assumption by only requiring such heterogeneous relationship in an auxiliary dataset different from the query/database domain. We craft a hybrid deep architecture to simultaneously learn the cross-modal correlation from the auxiliary dataset and align the dataset distributions between the auxiliary dataset and the query/database domain which generates transitive hash codes for heterogeneous multimedia retrieval.

	<td><p>Hashing is widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimodal retrieval with storage and computation efficiency. Cross-modal hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting semantic correlations across different modalities. Existing cross-modal hashing methods first transform data into low-dimensional feature vectors and then generate binary codes by another separate quantization step. However suboptimal hash codes may be generated since the quantization error is not explicitly minimized and the feature representation is not jointly optimized with the binary codes. This paper presents a Correlation Hashing Network (CHN) approach to cross-modal hashing which jointly learns good data representation tailored to hash coding and formally controls the quantization error. The proposed CHN is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a convolutional neural network for learning good image representations a multilayer perception for learning good text representations two hashing layers for generating compact binary codes and a structured max-margin loss that integrates all things together to enable learning similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes.

existing work on cross-modal hashing does not capture the
spatial dependency of images and temporal dynamics of text
sentences for learning powerful feature representations and
cross-modal embeddings that mitigate the heterogeneity of
different modalities. This paper presents a new Deep Visual Semantic Hashing (DVSH) model that generates compact
hash codes of images and sentences in an end-to-end deep
learning architecture, which capture the intrinsic cross-modal
correspondences between visual data and natural language.
DVSH is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a visual semantic fusion network for learning joint embedding space
of images and text sentences, and two modality-specific hashing networks for learning hash functions to generate compact
binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint multimodal embedding and cross-modal hashing, which is based
on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks
over images, Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and
a structured max-margin objective that integrates all things
together to enable learning of similarity-preserving and highquality hash codes. Extensive empirical evidence shows that
our DVSH approach yields state of the art results in crossmodal retrieval experiments on image-sentences datasets,

	<td><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in many areas of machine learning and data mining. During the past decade numerous hashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm claims outperform other state-of-the-art hashing methods. However the evaluation of these hashing papers was not thorough enough and those claims should be re-examined. The ultimate goal of an ANNS method is returning the most accurate answers (nearest neighbors) in the shortest time. If implemented correctly almost all the hashing methods will have their performance improved as the code length increases. However many existing hashing papers only report the performance with the code length shorter than 128. In this paper we carefully revisit the problem of search with a hash index and analyze the pros and cons of two popular hash index search procedures. Then we proposed a very simple but effective two level index structures and make a thorough comparison of eleven popular hashing algorithms. Surprisingly the random-projection-based Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the best performed algorithm which is in contradiction to the claims in all the other ten hashing papers. Despite the extreme simplicity of random-projection-based LSH our results show that the capability of this algorithm has been far underestimated. For the sake of reproducibility all the codes used in the paper are released on GitHub which can be used as a testing platform for a fair comparison between various hashing algorithms.</p>

Most traditional hashing methods first represent images as off-the-shelf visual features and then produce hashing codes in a separate stage. However off-the-shelf visual features may not be optimally compatible with the hash code learning procedure which may result in sub-optimal hash codes. Recently deep hashing methods have been proposed to simultaneously learn image features and hash codes using deep neural networks and have shown superior performance over traditional hashing methods. Most deep hashing methods are given supervised information in the form of pairwise labels or triplet labels. The current state-of-the-art deep hashing method DPSH~ which is based on pairwise labels performs image feature learning and hash code learning simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of pairwise similarities. Inspired by DPSH~ we propose a triplet label based deep hashing method which aims to maximize the likelihood of the given triplet labels.

	<td><p>Learning hash functions/codes for similarity search over multi-view data is attracting increasing attention where similar hash codes are assigned to the data objects characterizing consistently neighborhood relationship across views. Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three limitations 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix is first constructed followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these methods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with multiple representations are noise-freewhich is not practical in real-life applications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the neighborhood graph construction using all N points in the database (O(N)). In this paper we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the robust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations which may be noise corrupted. To achieve both the robustness and training efficiency we propose an approach to effectively and efficiently learning low-rank kernelized hash functions shared across views. Specifically we utilize landmark graphs to construct tractable similarity matrices in multi-views to automatically discover neighborhood structure in the data. To learn robust hash functions a latent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to accommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular a latent kernelized similarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based similarity matrices. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets validate the efficacy of our method in the presence of error corruptions.</p>

Considering the scale of modern datasets hashing is favorable for its low complexity. However most existing hashing methods are designed to preserve one single kind of similarity thus improper for dealing with the different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation we propose a new hashing method named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH) which jointly preserves the category and attribute similarities by exploiting the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to hierarchically capture the correlations between category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels are scarce our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework the binary codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network outputs of a binary-like layer and the attributes can be recovered from the codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval task while being more compact than the compared methods.</p>

To address these issues we propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be scalable to large-scale datasets. First the discrete learning procedure is decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and binary codes learning scheme which makes the learning procedure more efficient. Second we adopt the Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based Batch Coordinate Descent method such that the time and space complexity is reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to incorporate with arbitrary hash function including deep neural networks and kernel methods.

We propose a much simpler approach we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles.

	<td><p>Weighted minwise hashing (WMH) is one of the fundamental subroutine required by many celebrated approximation algorithms commonly adopted in industrial practice for large scale-search and learning. The resource bottleneck of the algorithms is the computation of multiple (typically a few hundreds to thousands) independent hashes of the data. The fastest hashing algorithm is by Ioffe which requires one pass over the entire data vector O(d) (d is the number of non-zeros) for computing one hash. However the requirement of multiple hashes demands hundreds or thousands passes over the data. This is very costly for modern massive dataset. In this work we break this expensive barrier and show an expected constant amortized time algorithm which computes k independent and unbiased WMH in time O(k) instead of O(dk) required by Ioffes method. Moreover our proposal only needs a few bits (5 - 9 bits) of storage per hash value compared to around 64 bits required by the state-of-art-methodologies. Experimental evaluations on real datasets show that for computing 500 WMH our proposal can be 60000x faster than the Ioffes method without losing any accuracy. Our method is also around 100x faster than approximate heuristics capitalizing on the efficient densified one permutation hashing schemes . Given the simplicity of our approach and its significant advantages we hope that it will replace existing implementations in practice.</p>

We assume that the semantic labels are governed by several latent attributes with each attribute on or off and classification relies on these attributes. Based on this assumption our approach dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH) constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design SSDH has a nice characteristic that classification and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover SSDH performs joint learning of image representations hash codes and classification in a point-wised manner and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy while the classification performance is not sacrificed.</p>

However topics of certain granularity are not adequate to represent the intrinsic semantic information. In this paper we present a novel unified approach for short text Hashing using Multi-granularity Topics and Tags dubbed HMTT. In particular we propose a selection method to choose the optimal multi-granularity topics depending on the type of dataset and design two distinct hashing strategies to incorporate multi-granularity topics.

applications (e.g., visual search, object detection, image

However, most of prior research mainly focused on compact hash code cleaning, and rare work studies how to build
multiple complementary hash tables, much less to adaptively integrate information stemming from multiple views.
In
this paper we first present a novel multi-view complementary hash table method that learns complementary hash tables from the data with multiple views. For single multiview table, using exemplar based feature fusion, we approximate the inherent data similarities with a low-rank matrix,
and learn discriminative hash functions in an efficient way.
To build complementary tables and meanwhile maintain scalable training and fast out-of-sample extension, an exemplar reweighting scheme is introduced to update the induced low-rank similarity in the sequential table construction framework, which indeed brings mutual benefits between tables by placing greater importance on exemplars
shared by mis-separated neighbors. Extensive experiments
on three large-scale image datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms various naive

To overcome this difficulty the proposed method embeds all the features of different domains in a shared latent space and regards each instance as a distribution of its own features in the shared latent space. To represent the distributions efficiently and nonparametrically we employ the framework of the kernel embeddings of distributions. The embedding is estimated so as to minimize the difference between distributions of paired instances while keeping unpaired instances apart. In our experiments we show that the proposed method can achieve high performance on finding correspondence between multi-lingual Wikipedia articles between documents and tags and between images and tags.</p>

1) the loss between the original real-valued feature descriptor

codes distribute evenly on each bit, and 3) different bits
are as independent as possible. To further improve the discriminative
power of the learned binary codes, we extend
DH into supervised DH (SDH) by including one discriminative

maximizes the inter-class variations and minimizes

The proposed method is also remarkably faster in the learning phase. Along with the efficiency the retrieval accuracy is comparable to or slightly outperforming the state-of-the-art. Pairwise rotations used in our method are formulated from an analytical study of the trade-off relationship between quantization error and entropy of binary codes. Although these hashing criteria are widely used in previous researches its analytical behavior is rarely studied. All building blocks of our algorithm are based on the analytical solution and it thus provides a fairly simple and efficient procedure.</p>

This typically results in a difficult optimization problem nonconvex and nonsmooth because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training solving a continuous optimization and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results but the hash function was still learned a posteriori which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as a corrected iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.</p>

While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency we argue that one can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs between accuracy and diversity.

hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of output
hashing codes are preset in most previous methods, neglecting the
significance level of different bits and restricting their practical
flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised
learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing
codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as
a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically, we
organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples,
each sample containing two images with the same label and one
with a different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize
the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the
Hamming space. In addition, a regularization term is introduced
to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e., images of similar
appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional
neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end
fashion, where discriminative image features and hash functions
are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, each bit of our
hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate
the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our
framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks
of similar image search and also achieves promising results in
the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is
also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well
preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.</p>

Another advantage of our method is that instead of relaxing the binary constraint of codes during the learning process as most previous works in this paper by introducing the auxiliary variable we reformulate the optimization into two sub-optimization steps allowing us to efficiently solve binary constraints without any relaxation. The proposed method is also extended to the supervised hashing by leveraging the label information such that the learned binary codes preserve the pairwise label of inputs.

processing time and in compressing massive databases. Although lots of approaches have been developed to learn
data-dependent hash functions in recent years, how to learn
hash functions to yield good performance with acceptable
computational and memory cost is still a challenging problem. Based on the observation that retrieval precision is
highly related to the kNN classification accuracy, this paper
proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method,
which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN
accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make
it scalable well to large problem, we propose a factorized
neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the
neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable,
we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn
accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and
storage cost. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p>

methods embedded heterogeneous data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, and then
rounded the continuous embeddings to obtain the

this purpose, a novel Semantic Topic Multimodal
Hashing (STMH) is developed by considering latent semantic information in coding procedure.
It
first discovers clustering patterns of texts and robust factorizes the matrix of images to obtain multiple semantic topics of texts and concepts of images.
Then the learned multimodal semantic features are
transformed into a common subspace by their correlations. Finally, each bit of unified hash code
can be generated directly by figuring out whether a
topic or concept is contained in a text or an image.
Therefore, the obtained model by STMH is more
suitable for hashing scheme as it directly learns discrete hash codes in the coding process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method

	<td><p>Randomized algorithms are often enjoyed for their simplicity but the hash functions employed to yield the desired probabilistic guarantees are often too complicated to be practical. Here we survey recent results on how simple hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees. Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist 1970. Keys are viewed as consisting of c characters and we have precomputed character tables h_1…h_c mapping characters to random hash values. A key x=(x_1…x_c) is hashed to h_1x_1 oplus h_2x_2…..oplus h_cx_c. This schemes is very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even 4-independent it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally obtained via higher independence e.g. linear probing and Cuckoo hashing. Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is twisted in a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional properties Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and data-structures. Finally we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation functions applying one to the output of the other and show that this yields very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman 1977. In fact w.h.p. for a given set of size proportional to that of the space consumed double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given time and space. While these tabulation schemes are all easy to implement and use their analysis is not.</p>

Because the estimator of 0-bit CWS constitutes a positive definite kernel, this method can be naturally applied to large-scale data mining problems. Basically, if we feed the sampled data from 0-bit CWS to a highly efficient linear classifier (e.g., linear SVM), we effectively (and approximately) train a nonlinear classifier based on the min-max kernel. The accuracy improves as we increase the sample size.</p>

<p>In this paper, we first demonstrate, through an extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. This helps justify the use of min-max kernel. However, as the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data, we propose to linearize the min-max kernel via 0-bit CWS, a simplification of the original CWS method.</p>

<p>The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces samples in the form of (i<em>, t</em>) where the i* records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the t* is theoretically unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. We provide a simple solution by discarding t* (which we refer to as the “0-bit” scheme). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information. We then apply 0-bit CWS for building linear classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated on a wide range of public datasets.</p>

	<td><p>An attractive approach for fast search in image
databases is binary hashing, where each high-dimensional,
real-valued image is mapped onto a low-dimensional, binary
vector and the search is done in this binary space.
Finding the optimal hash function is difficult because it involves
binary constraints, and most approaches approximate
the optimization by relaxing the constraints and then
binarizing the result. Here, we focus on the binary autoencoder
model, which seeks to reconstruct an image from the
binary code produced by the hash function. We show that
the optimization can be simplified with the method of auxiliary
coordinates. This reformulates the optimization as
alternating two easier steps: one that learns the encoder
and decoder separately, and one that optimizes the code for

	<td><p>An attractive approach for fast search in image databases is binary hashing where each high-dimensional real-valued image is mapped onto a low-dimensional binary vector and the search is done in this binary space. Finding the optimal hash function is difficult because it involves binary constraints and most approaches approximate the optimization by relaxing the constraints and then binarizing the result. Here we focus on the binary autoencoder model which seeks to reconstruct an image from the binary code produced by the hash function. We show that the optimization can be simplified with the method of auxiliary coordinates. This reformulates the optimization as alternating two easier steps one that learns the encoder and decoder separately and one that optimizes the code for each image. Image retrieval experiments using precision/recall and a measure of code utilization show the resulting hash function outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for binary hashing.</p>

increasingly popular because of their high efficiency in handling large-scale computer vision applications. It has been
demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that
leverage supervised information can significantly enhance
the coding quality, and hence greatly benefit visual search
tasks. Typically, a modern binary coding method seeks
to learn a group of coding functions which compress data
samples into binary codes. However, few methods pursued
the coding functions such that the precision at the top of
a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized.
In this paper, we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach, namely
Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC), which
explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train
the disciplined coding functions, by which the mistakes at
the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized
more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions, we relax the original discrete optimization objective
with a continuous surrogate, and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost, we also design an online
learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more
efficiently. Empirical studies based upon three benchmark
image datasets demonstrate that the proposed binary coding approach achieves superior image search accuracy over
the state-of-the-arts.</p>

Unfortunately batch-learning strategies can be inefficient when confronted with large training datasets. Moreover with batch-learners it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as a dataset continues to grow and diversify over time. Yet in many practical scenarios the dataset grows and diversifies; thus both the hash functions and the indexing must swiftly accommodate these changes. To address these issues we propose an online hashing method that is amenable to changes and expansions of the datasets. Since it is an online algorithm our approach offers linear complexity with the dataset size. Our solution is supervised in that we incorporate available label information to preserve the semantic neighborhood. Such an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the hash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is high then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the system especially for large indexes. Thus we also propose a framework to reduce hash table updates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art solutions on two benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.</p>

	<td><p>The explosive growth in big data has attracted much attention in designing efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications such as large-scale search and pattern matching finding the nearest neighbors to a query is a fundamental research problem. However the straightforward solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational complexity and memory requirement. In response Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior randomized hashing methods e.g. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) explore data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations. Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain metric spaces performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in many real-world applications. As a remedy new approaches incorporating data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have emerged. Such learning to hash methods exploit information such as data distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions. Importantly the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of insights pros and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash framework and representative techniques of various types including unsupervised semi-supervised and supervised. In addition we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep learning models. Finally we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area.</p>

Binary Hashing. Given a distance matrix, a binary hashing
algorithm solves for a binary code for the given set of examples, whose Hamming distance nicely approximates the
original distances. The formulation is non-convex — so existing solutions adopt spectral relaxations or perform coordinate descent (or quantization) on a surrogate objective
that is numerically more tractable. In this paper, we first
derive an Augmented Lagrangian approach to optimize the
standard binary Hashing objective (i.e., maintain fidelity
with a given distance matrix). With appropriate step sizes,
we find that this scheme already yields results that match or
substantially outperform state of the art methods on most
benchmarks used in the literature. Then, to allow the model
to scale to large datasets, we obtain an interesting reformulation of the binary hashing objective as a non-negative matrix factorization. Later, this leads to a simple multiplicative updates algorithm — whose parallelization properties

	<td><p>Efficient similarity retrieval from large-scale multimodal database is pervasive in modern search engines and social networks. To support queries across content modalities the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme that is they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.</p>

leverage both pairwise as well as easy-to-obtain relative
preference based cross-modal constraints, (ii) the probabilistic framework naturally allows querying for the
most useful/informative constraints, facilitating an active learning setting (existing methods for cross-modal
similarity learning do not have such a mechanism), and
(iii) the binary code length is learned from the data. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
on two problems that require computing pairwise similarities between cross-modal object pairs: cross-modal

We propose a novel and efficient training algorithm inspired by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that overcomes some of these limitations. Our method decomposes the training process into independent layer-wise local updates through auxiliary variables. Empirically we observe that our training algorithm always converges and its computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the networks. Empirically we manage to train DNNs with 64 hidden layers and 1024 nodes per layer for supervised hashing in about 3 hours using a single GPU.

In particular our lower bound matches the bound of rhole 2c-1+o(1) for the ell_1 space obtained via the recent algorithm from Andoni-Razenshteyn STOC15. In recent years it emerged that data-dependent hashing is strictly superior to the classical Locality-Sensitive Hashing when the hash function is data-independent. In the latter setting the best exponent has been already known for the ell_1 space the tight bound is rho=1/c with the upper bound from Indyk-Motwani STOC98 and the matching lower bound from ODonnell-Wu-Zhou ITCS11. We prove that even if the hashing is data-dependent it must hold that rhoge 2c-1-o(1). To prove the result we need to formalize the exact notion of data-dependent hashing that also captures the complexity of the hash functions (in addition to their collision properties). Without restricting such complexity we would allow for obviously infeasible solutions such as the Voronoi diagram of a dataset. To preclude such solutions we require our hash functions to be succinct. This condition is satisfied by all the known algorithmic results.</p>

	<td><p>Extracting informative image features and learning effective approximate hashing functions are two crucial steps in image retrieval . Conventional methods often study these two steps separately e.g. learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency i.e. images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.</p>

Most of these deep hashing methods are supervised whose supervised information is given with triplet labels. For another common application scenario with pairwise labels there have not existed methods for simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method called deep pairwise-supervised hashing(DPSH) to perform simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning for applications with pairwise labels.

	<td><p>Randomized algorithms and data structures are often analyzed under the assumption of access to a perfect source of randomness. The most fundamental metric used to measure how random a hash function or a random number generator is is its independence a sequence of random variables is said to be k-independent if every variable is uniform and every size k subset is independent. In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited independence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort min-wise hashing and largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be summarized as follows. -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a 5-independent hash function Karloff and Raghavan J.ACM93 showed O ( n log n) expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort. We improve upon this showing that the same running time is achieved with only 4-independence. -Min-wise hashing. For a set A consider the probability of a particular element being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that 5-independence implies the optimal probability O (1 /n). Broder et al. STOC98 showed that 2-independence implies it is O(1 / ). We show a matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for 3- and 4-independent hash functions. -Largest bucket. We consider the case where n balls are distributed to n buckets using a k-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket size. Alon et. al STOC97 showed that there exists a 2-independent hash function implying a bucket of size Omega ( n^1/2). We generalize the bound providing a k-independent family of functions that imply size Omega ( n^1/k).</p>

	<td><p>A typical image retrieval pipeline starts with the comparison of global descriptors from a large database to find a short list of candidate matches. A good image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two contradictory requirements providing recall rates as high as possible and being as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image classification descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place of the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with better retrieval performances. Nevertheless the dimensionality of a typical DCNN descriptor –extracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the fully-connected layers– remains quite high at several thousands of scalar values. In this paper we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH) a fully unsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes –in the 32-256 bits range– from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two successive deep learning steps. First Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBM) a type of unsupervised deep neural nets are used to learn binary embedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired bitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the expense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN descriptor space. Then triplet networks a rank learning scheme based on weight sharing nets is used to fine-tune the binary embedding functions to retain as much as possible of the useful metric properties of the original space. A thorough empirical evaluation conducted on multiple publicly available dataset using DCNN descriptors shows that our method is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised schemes in the target bit range.</p>

	<td><p>Approximate nearest neighbor search is an efficient strategy for large-scale image retrieval. Encouraged by the recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose an effective deep learning framework to generate binary hash codes for fast image retrieval. Our idea is that when the data labels are available, binary codes can be learned by employing a hidden layer for representing the latent concepts that dominate the class labels.
he utilization of the CNN also allows for learning image representations. Unlike other supervised methods that require pair-wised inputs for binary code learning, our method learns hash codes and image representations in a point-wised manner, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. We further demonstrate its scalability and efficacy on a large-scale dataset of 1 million clothing images.</p>

Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.</p>

The efficiency of the new construction essentially their bound when the search radius is not too large — e.g. when cr = o(log(n)/loglog n) where n is the number of points in the data set and when cr = log(n)/k where k is an integer constant. In general it differs by at most a factor ln(4) in the exponent of the time bounds. As a consequence LSH-based similarity search in Hamming space can avoid the problem of false negatives at little or no cost in efficiency.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a widely-used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. For most existing hashing methods an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. However such visual feature vectors may not be optimally compatible with the coding process thus producing sub-optimal hashing codes. In this paper we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing in which images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image datasets show that the proposed simultaneous feature learning and hash coding pipeline brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art supervised or unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

The key idea is to exploit the redundancy in a large number of candidate sets obtained by independently generated random projections in order to reduce the number of expensive exact distance evaluations. The method is straightforward to implement using sparse projections which leads to a reduced memory footprint and fast index construction. Furthermore it enables grouping of the required computations into big matrix multiplications which leads to additional savings due to cache effects and low-level parallelization.

	<td><p>Embedding image features into a binary Hamming space can improve both the speed and accuracy of large-scale query-by-example image retrieval systems. Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact binary codes in a manner which preserves the label-based similarities of the original data. Most existing approaches apply a single form of hash function and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of those methods and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. In this work we proffer a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. The proposed framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context and simplifies the development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes the into two steps binary code (hash bits) learning and hash function learning. The first step can typically be formulated as a binary quadratic problem and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary classifiers. For solving large-scale binary code inference we show how to ensure that the binary quadratic problems are submodular such that an efficient graph cut approach can be used. To achieve efficiency as well as efficacy on large-scale high-dimensional data we propose to use boosted decision trees as the hash functions which are nonlinear highly descriptive and very fast to train and evaluate. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods especially on high-dimensional data.</p>

This generic method was originally introduced by Flajolet and Martin~FOCS83 in order to save a factor Omega(k) of time per element over k independent samples when estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream. It was also used in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet et al.~AOFA97 and in large-scale machine learning by Li et al.~NIPS12 for minwise estimation of set similarity. The main issue of k-partition is that the contents of different bins may be highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods of analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we show that a tabulation based hash function mixed tabulation does yield strong concentration bounds on the most popular applications of k-partitioning similar to those we would get using a truly random hash function. The analysis is very involved and implies several new results of independent interest for both simple and double tabulation e.g. a simple and efficient construction for invertible bloom filters and uniform hashing on a given set.</p>

	<td><p>We present a simple but powerful reinterpretation of kernelized locality-sensitive hashing (KLSH) a general and popular method developed in the vision community for performing approximate nearest-neighbor searches in an arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Our new perspective is based on viewing the steps of the KLSH algorithm in an appropriately projected space and has several key theoretical and practical benefits. First it eliminates the problematic conceptual difficulties that are present in the existing motivation of KLSH. Second it yields the first formal retrieval performance bounds for KLSH. Third our analysis reveals two techniques for boosting the empirical performance of KLSH. We evaluate these extensions on several large-scale benchmark image retrieval data sets and show that our analysis leads to improved recall performance of at least 12 and sometimes much higher over the standard KLSH method.</p>

	<td><p>Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving the Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques in contrast are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high-dimensional data. The complexities of these models and the problems with out-of-sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding however. In this work how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties an efficient inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of t-SNE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved for example by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal rotations. In addition a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is developed by incorporating the label information which is shown to greatly advance the semantic retrieval performance.</p>

	<td><p>The query complexity of locality sensitive hashing
(LSH) based similarity search is dominated
by the number of hash evaluations, and this number
grows with the data size (Indyk &amp; Motwani,
1998). In industrial applications such as search
where the data are often high-dimensional and
binary (e.g., text n-grams), minwise hashing is
widely adopted, which requires applying a large
number of permutations on the data. This is
costly in computation and energy-consumption.
In this paper, we propose a hashing technique
which generates all the necessary hash evaluations
needed for similarity search, using one
single permutation. The heart of the proposed
hash function is a “rotation” scheme which densifies
the sparse sketches of one permutation
hashing (Li et al., 2012) in an unbiased fashion
thereby maintaining the LSH property. This
makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table
construction. This idea of rotation presented
in this paper could be of independent interest for
densifying other types of sparse sketches.
Using our proposed hashing method, the query
time of a (K, L)-parameterized LSH is reduced
from the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely
O(KL + dL), where d is the number of nonzeros
of the data vector, K is the number of hashes
in each hash table, and L is the number of hash
tables. Our experimental evaluation on real data
confirms that the proposed scheme significantly
reduces the query processing time over minwise
hashing without loss in retrieval accuracies.</p>

	<td><p>The similarity searches that use high-dimensional feature vectors consisting of a vast amount of data have a wide range of application. One way of conducting a fast similarity search is to transform the feature vectors into binary vectors and perform the similarity search by using the Hamming distance. Such a transformation is a hashing method and the choice of hashing function is important. Hashing methods using hyperplanes or hyperspheres are proposed. One study reported here is inspired by Spherical LSH and we use hypersperes to hash the feature vectors. Our method called Eclipse-hashing performs a compactification of R^n by using the inverse stereographic projection which is a kind of Alexandrov compactification. By using Eclipse-hashing one can obtain the hypersphere-hash function without explicitly using hyperspheres. Hence the number of nonlinear operations is reduced and the processing time of hashing becomes shorter. Furthermore we also show that as a result of improving the approximation accuracy Eclipse-hashing is more accurate than hyperplane-hashing.</p>

Traditional random forest fails to enforce the consistency of hashes generated from each tree for the same class data i.e. to preserve the underlying similarity and it also lacks a principled way for code aggregation across trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme where independently trained random trees in a forest are acting as hashing functions. We the propose a subspace model as the splitting function and show that it enforces the hash consistency in a tree for data from the same class.

We cast the graph hashing problem into a discrete optimization framework which directly learns the binary codes. A tractable alternating maximization algorithm is then proposed to explicitly deal with the discrete constraints yielding high-quality codes to well capture the local neighborhoods.

supervised hashing methods for images, an input
image is usually encoded by a vector of hand-crafted

do not necessarily preserve the accurate semantic
similarities of images pairs, which may often degrade
the performance of hashing function learning. In this
paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for
image retrieval, in which we automatically learn a good
image representation tailored to hashing as well as a
set of hash functions. The proposed method has two
stages. In the first stage, given the pairwise similarity
matrix S over training images, we propose a scalable
coordinate descent method to decompose S into a
product of HHT where H is a matrix with each of its
rows being the approximate hash code associated to
a training image. In the second stage, we propose to
simultaneously learn a good feature representation for
the input images as well as a set of hash functions, via
a deep convolutional network tailored to the learned
hash codes in H and optionally the discrete class labels
of the images. Extensive empirical evaluations on three
benchmark datasets with different kinds of images

	<td><p>Large-scale data mining and retrieval applications have
increasingly turned to compact binary data representations
as a way to achieve both fast queries and efficient
data storage; many algorithms have been proposed for
learning effective binary encodings. Most of these algorithms
focus on learning a set of projection hyperplanes
for the data and simply binarizing the result from each
hyperplane, but this neglects the fact that informativeness
may not be uniformly distributed across the projections.
In this paper, we address this issue by proposing
a novel adaptive quantization (AQ) strategy that
adaptively assigns varying numbers of bits to different
hyperplanes based on their information content. Our
method provides an information-based schema that preserves
the neighborhood structure of data points, and
we jointly find the globally optimal bit-allocation for
all hyperplanes. In our experiments, we compare with
state-of-the-art methods on four large-scale datasets
and find that our adaptive quantization approach significantly
improves on traditional hashing methods.</p>

In order to speed up the computation a random permutation can be approximated by using an universal hash function such as the h_ab function proposed by Carter and Wegman. A better estimate of the Jaccard Index can be achieved by using many of these hash functions created at random. In this paper a new iterative procedure to generate a set of h_ab functions is devised that eliminates the need for a list of random values and avoid the multiplication operation during the calculation. The properties of the generated hash functions remains that of an universal hash function family. This is possible due to the random nature of features occurrence on sparse datasets. Results show that the uniformity of hashing the features is maintaned while obtaining a speed up of up to 1.38 compared to the traditional approach.</p>

Each nucleotide is encoded as a fixed gray level intensity pixel and the hash is calculated from its significant frequency characteristics. This results to a drastic data reduction between the sequence and the perceptual hash.

	<td><p>Binary codes have been widely used in vision problems as a compact feature representation to achieve both space and time advantages. Various methods have been proposed to learn data-dependent hash functions which map a feature vector to a binary code. However considerable data information is inevitably lost during the binarization step which also causes ambiguity in measuring sample similarity using Hamming distance. Besides the learned hash functions cannot be changed after training which makes them incapable of adapting to new data outside the training data set. To address both issues in this paper we propose a flexible bitwise weight learning framework based on the binary codes obtained by state-of-the-art hashing methods and incorporate the learned weights into the weighted Hamming distance computation. We then formulate the proposed framework as a ranking problem and leverage the Ranking SVM model to offline tackle the weight learning. The framework is further extended to an online mode which updates the weights at each time new data comes thereby making it scalable to large and dynamic data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains of using binary codes with bitwise weighting in image retrieval tasks. It is appealing that the online weight learning leads to comparable accuracy with its offline counterpart which thus makes our approach practical for realistic applications.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search is critical for many database applications including the increasingly popular online services for Content-Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR). These services which include image search engines must handle an overwhelming volume of data while keeping low response times. Thus scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web-scale applications but most existing methods are sequential and target shared-memory machines. Here we address these issues with a distributed efficient and scalable index based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular techniques for similarity search but its poor referential locality properties has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data storage locality-aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing and multi-probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained an efficiency of 90 in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In particular the original locality-aware data partition reduced the number of messages exchanged in 30. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with 10^9 128-d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images. This is two orders of magnitude larger than datasets that previous LSH parallelizations could handle.</p>

a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and
poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is
important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming
distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary
codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level
weights to different hash bits, the returned binary codes
are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give
an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive
weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale
image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted
Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p>

	<td><p>Most existing cross-modal hashing methods suffer from the scalability issue in the training phase. In this paper, we propose a novel 
cross-modal hashing approach with a linear time complexity to the training data size, to enable scalable indexing for multimedia 
search across multiple modals. Taking both the intra-similarity in each modal and the inter-similarity across different modals 
into consideration, the proposed approach aims at effectively learning hash functions from large-scale training datasets. 
More specifically, for each modal, we first partition the training data into $k$ clusters and then represent each training data 
point with its distances to $k$ centroids of the clusters. Interestingly, such a k-dimensional data representation can reduce 
the time complexity of the training phase from traditional O(n2) or higher to O(n), where $n$ is the training data size, leading to 
practical learning on large-scale datasets. We further prove that this new representation preserves the intra-similarity in each modal. 
To preserve the inter-similarity among data points across different modals, we transform the derived data representations into a 
common binary subspace in which binary codes from all the modals are “consistent” and comparable. The transformation simultaneously 
outputs the hash functions for all modals, which are used to convert unseen data into binary codes. Given a query of one modal, 
it is first mapped into the binary codes using the modal’s hash functions, followed by matching the database binary codes of any other 
modals. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets confirm the scalability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in 
comparison with the state of the art.</p>

It is able to return results of different media types from heterogeneous data sources, e.g., using a query image to retrieve relevant text documents or images from different data sources. This utilizes the widely available data from different sources and caters for the current users’ demand of receiving a result list simultaneously containing multiple types of data to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the query’s results. To enable large-scale inter-media retrieval, we propose a novel inter-media hashing (IMH) model to explore the correlations among multiple media types from different data sources and tackle the scalability issue. To this end, multimedia data from heterogeneous data sources are transformed into a common Hamming space, in which fast search can be easily implemented by XOR and bit-count operations. Furthermore, we integrate a linear regression model to learn hashing functions so that the hash codes for new data points can be efficiently generated. Experiments conducted on real-world large-scale multimedia datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

The complexity of these models and the problems with out-of-sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding however. In this work we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties we describe an efficient inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available.

In this paper we propose a way to overcome this limitation by enforcing the hash codes to be sparse. Sparse high-dimensional codes enjoy from the low false positive rates typical of long hashes while keeping the false negative rates similar to those of a shorter dense hashing scheme with equal number of degrees of freedom.

and many other areas. One popular algorithm for similarity search, especially for high dimensional data (where spatial indexes like kdtrees do not perform well) is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), an
approximation algorithm for finding similar objects. In this paper, we describe a new variant of LSH, called Parallel
LSH (PLSH) designed to be extremely efficient, capable of scaling out on multiple nodes and multiple cores, and which supports highthroughput streaming of new data. Our approach employs several
novel ideas, including: cache-conscious hash table layout, using a 2-level merge algorithm for hash table construction; an efficient
algorithm for duplicate elimination during hash-table querying; an insert-optimized hash table structure and efficient data expiration

optimize parameter settings. We show that on a workload where we perform similarity search on a dataset of &gt; 1 Billion tweets, with
hundreds of millions of new tweets per day, we can achieve query times of 1–2.5 ms. We show that this is an order of magnitude faster
than existing indexing schemes, such as inverted indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest implementation of LSH,
with table construction times up to 3.7x faster and query times that are 8.3x faster than a basic implementation.</p>

	<td><p>Image perceptual hashing finds applications in content indexing large-scale image database management certification and authentication and digital watermarking. We propose a Block-DCT and PCA based image perceptual hash in this article and explore the algorithm in the application of tamper detection. The main idea of the algorithm is to integrate color histogram and DCT coefficients of image blocks as perceptual feature then to compress perceptual features as inter-feature with PCA and to threshold to create a robust hash. The robustness and discrimination properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in detail. Our algorithms first construct a secondary image derived from input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately capture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which does not perceptually resemble the input) we further extract the final features which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably quantized). In this paper we use spectral matrix invariants as embodied by Singular Value Decomposition. Surprisingly formation of the secondary image turns out be quite important since it not only introduces further robustness but also enhances the security properties. Indeed our experiments reveal that our hashing algorithms extract most of the geometric information from the images and hence are robust to severe perturbations (e.g. up to 50 cropping by area with 20 degree rotations) on images while avoiding misclassification. Experimental results show that the proposed image perceptual hash algorithm can effectively address the tamper detection problem with advantageous robustness and discrimination.</p>

Recent work shows that learned binary projections are a powerful way to index large collections according to their content. The basic idea is to formulate the projections so as to approximately preserve a given similarity function of interest. Having done so, one can then search the data efficiently using hash tables, or by exploring the Hamming ball volume around a novel query. Both enable sub-linear time retrieval with respect to the database size. Further, depending on the design of the projections, in some cases it is possible to bound the number of database examples that must be searched in order to achieve a given level of accuracy.</p>

<p>This chapter overviews data structures for fast search with binary codes, and then describes several supervised and unsupervised strategies for generating the codes. In particular, we review supervised methods that integrate metric learning, boosting, and neural networks into the hash key construction, and unsupervised methods based on spectral analysis or kernelized random projections that compute affinity-preserving binary codes.Whether learning from explicit semantic supervision or exploiting the structure among unlabeled data, these methods make scalable retrieval possible for a variety of robust visual similarity measures.We focus on defining the algorithms, and illustrate the main points with results using millions of images.</p>

Recently a number of approaches to learning data-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work we propose a column generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.</p>

Our proposed method, dubbed Neighbourhood Preserving Quantization (NPQ), assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds. NPQ exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits. NPQ is not only applicable to LSH, but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme. Despite using half the number of hyperplanes, NPQ is shown to improve LSH-based retrieval accuracy by up to 65% compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Although hashing techniques have been popular for the large scale similarity search problem, most of the existing methods for designing optimal hash functions focus on homogeneous similarity assessment, i.e., the data entities to be indexed are of the same type. Realizing that heterogeneous entities and relationships are also ubiquitous in the real world applications, there is an emerging need to retrieve and search similar or relevant data entities from multiple heterogeneous domains, e.g., recommending relevant posts and images to a certain Facebook user. In this paper, we address the problem of ``comparing apples to oranges’’ under the large scale setting. Specifically, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Hashing (RaHH), which provides a general framework for generating hash codes of data entities sitting in multiple heterogeneous domains. Unlike some existing hashing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space, the RaHH approach constructs a Hamming space for each type of data entities, and learns optimal mappings between them simultaneously. This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover, the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method, we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites, Tencent Weibo, and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RaHH outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods with significant performance gains.</p>

Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called isotropic hashing (IsoHash), to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions, which verifies the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances.</p>

Most existing hashing methods adopt Hamming distance to

it may destroy the neighborhood structure in the original feature

Manhattan hashing (MH), which is based on Manhattan distance, is

The basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with
multiple bits of natural binary code (NBC), based on which the
Manhattan distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated
for nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the
neighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt Manhattan
distance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several largescale

our MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art

	<td><p>Hashing, which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary
codes for data representation, has been widely
used for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive
databases due to its fast query speed and low storage
cost. Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best
binary codes for a given data set, mainstream hashing
methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the
first stage, several projected dimensions of real values
are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values
will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding.
Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to
quantize each projected dimension. One problem with
this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold
typically lies in the region of the highest point density
and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to
the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits,
which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing.
In this paper, we propose a novel quantization strategy,
called double-bit quantization (DBQ), to solve the
problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize
each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively
learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two
real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can signifi-

	<td><p>A new line of research uses compression methods to measure the similarity between signals. Two signals are considered similar if one can be compressed significantly when the information of the other is known. The existing compression-based similarity methods although successful in the discrete one dimensional domain do not work well in the context of images. This paper proposes a sparse representation-based approach to encode the information content of an image using information from the other image and uses the compactness (sparsity) of the representation as a measure of its compressibility (how much can the image be compressed) with respect to the other image. The more sparse the representation of an image the better it can be compressed and the more it is similar to the other image. The efficacy of the proposed measure is demonstrated through the high accuracies achieved in image clustering retrieval and classification.</p>

	<td><p>Hyperplane hashing aims at rapidly searching nearest points to a hyperplane and has shown practical impact in scaling up active learning with SVMs. Unfortunately the existing randomized methods need long hash codes to achieve reasonable search accuracy and thus suffer from reduced search speed and large memory overhead. To this end this paper proposes a novel hyperplane hashing technique which yields compact hash codes. The key idea is the bilinear form of the proposed hash functions which leads to higher collision probability than the existing hyperplane hash functions when using random projections. To further increase the performance we propose a learning based framework in which the bilinear functions are directly learned from the data. This results in short yet discriminative codes and also boosts the search performance over the random projection based solutions. Large-scale active learning experiments carried out on two datasets with up to one million samples demonstrate the overall superiority of the proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>Many binary code encoding schemes based on hashing
have been actively studied recently, since they can provide
efficient similarity search, especially nearest neighbor
search, and compact data representations suitable for handling
large scale image databases in many computer vision
problems. Existing hashing techniques encode highdimensional
data points by using hyperplane-based hashing
functions. In this paper we propose a novel hyperspherebased
hashing function, spherical hashing, to map more
spatially coherent data points into a binary code compared
to hyperplane-based hashing functions. Furthermore, we
propose a new binary code distance function, spherical
Hamming distance, that is tailored to our hyperspherebased
binary coding scheme, and design an efficient iterative
optimization process to achieve balanced partitioning
of data points for each hash function and independence between
hashing functions. Our extensive experiments show
that our spherical hashing technique significantly outperforms
six state-of-the-art hashing techniques based on hyperplanes
across various image benchmarks of sizes ranging
from one to 75 million of GIST descriptors. The performance
gains are consistent and large, up to 100% improvements.
The excellent results confirm the unique merits of
the proposed idea in using hyperspheres to encode proximity
regions in high-dimensional spaces. Finally, our method
is intuitive and easy to implement.</p>

For real-time mobile applications very fast but less accurate descriptors like BRIEF and related methods use a random sampling of pairwise comparisons of pixel intensities in an image patch. Here we introduce Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor (LUCID) a simple description method based on permutation distances between the ordering of intensities of RGB values between two patches. LUCID is computable in linear time with respect to patch size and does not require floating point computation. An analysis reveals an underlying issue that limits the potential of BRIEF and related approaches compared to LUCID. Experiments demonstrate that LUCID is faster than BRIEF and its accuracy is directly comparable to SURF while being more than an order of magnitude faster.</p>

Such data typically arises in a large number of vision and text applications where counts or frequencies are used as features. Also cosine distance is commonly used as a measure of dissimilarity between such vectors. In this work we introduce a novel spherical quantization scheme to generate binary embedding of such data and analyze its properties. The number of quantization landmarks in this scheme grows exponentially with data dimensionality resulting in low-distortion quantization. We propose a very efficient method for computing the binary embedding using such large number of landmarks. Further a linear transformation is learned to minimize the quantization error by adapting the method to the input data resulting in improved embedding. Experiments on image and text retrieval applications show superior performance of the proposed method over other existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Instead of the full randomness needed for the analysis of Kirsch et al. and of Kutzelnigg (2010) (resp. Theta(log n)-wise independence for standard cuckoo hashing) the new approach even works with 2-wise independent hash families as building blocks. Both construction and analysis build upon the work of Dietzfelbinger and Woelfel (2003). The analysis which can also be applied to the fully random case utilizes a graph counting argument and is much simpler than previous proofs.

	<td><p>Locality-sensitive hashing converts high-dimensional feature vectors such as image and speech into bit arrays and allows high-speed similarity calculation with the Hamming distance. There is a hashing scheme that maps feature vectors to bit arrays depending on the signs of the inner products between feature vectors and the normal vectors of hyperplanes placed in the feature space. This hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If labels for data are given one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning algorithms. However many proposed learning methods do not consider the hyperplanes offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes small. In this paper we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms without the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this method the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of spaces as if it takes into account the offsets. For the proposed method we input several high-dimensional feature data sets and studied the relationship between the statistical characteristics of data the number of hyperplanes and the effect of the proposed method.</p>

i.e. compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance
between codewords correlates with similarity. In reviewing and
comparing existing methods, we show that their relative performance can
change drastically depending on the definition of ground-truth neighbors.
Motivated by this finding, we propose a new formulation for learning binary
codes which seeks to reconstruct the affinity between datapoints,
rather than their distances. We show that this criterion is intractable
to solve exactly, but a spectral relaxation gives an algorithm where the
bits correspond to thresholded eigenvectors of the affinity matrix, and
as the number of datapoints goes to infinity these eigenvectors converge
to eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operators, similar to the recently
proposed Spectral Hashing (SH) method. Unlike SH whose performance
may degrade as the number of bits increases, the optimal code using
our formulation is guaranteed to faithfully reproduce the affinities as
the number of bits increases. We show that the number of eigenfunctions
needed may increase exponentially with dimension, but introduce a “kernel
trick” to allow us to compute with an exponentially large number of
bits but using only memory and computation that grows linearly with
dimension. Experiments shows that MDSH outperforms the state-of-the
art, especially in the challenging regime of small distance thresholds.</p>

Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper we propose a novel method called isotropic hashing (IsoHash) to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances).

	<td><p>In this paper we study several critical issues which must be tackled before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used industrial applications especially in the context of search. 1. (b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g. 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. 2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially reduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However as online algorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context of search it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for them. This paper demonstrates that b-bit minwise hashing provides an effective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically reduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process. This is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g. 10 to 100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy. 3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix due to its space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions e.g. the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.</p>

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of
hashing in large-scale vision problems. It has been shown
that the hashing quality could be boosted by leveraging supervised
information into hash function learning. However,
the existing supervised methods either lack adequate performance
or often incur cumbersome model training. In this
paper, we propose a novel kernel-based supervised hashing
model which requires a limited amount of supervised information,
i.e., similar and dissimilar data pairs, and a feasible
training cost in achieving high quality hashing. The idea
is to map the data to compact binary codes whose Hamming
distances are minimized on similar pairs and simultaneously
maximized on dissimilar pairs. Our approach is
distinct from prior works by utilizing the equivalence between
optimizing the code inner products and the Hamming
distances. This enables us to sequentially and efficiently
train the hash functions one bit at a time, yielding very
short yet discriminative codes. We carry out extensive experiments
on two image benchmarks with up to one million
samples, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-arts in searching both metric distance
neighbors and semantically similar neighbors, with
accuracy gains ranging from 13% to 46%.</p>

Recently hashing-based approaches e.g. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are proved to be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbors search. Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly a large number of hash tables (i.e. long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation we propose a novel hashing algorithm called em Density Sensitive Hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data.

Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures

dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to
closely fit data distribution and provide better selectivity
than usual random projections such as LSH. However, improvements
occur only for relatively small hash code sizes
up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper, this is mainly
due to the lack of independence between the produced hash
functions. We introduce a new hash function family that
attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather
than boosting the collision probability of close points, our
method focus on data scattering. By training purely random
splits of the data, regardless the closeness of the training
samples, it is indeed possible to generate consistently
more independent hash functions. On the other side, the
use of large margin classifiers allows to maintain good generalization
performances. Experiments show that our new

	<td><p>High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efficiency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efficiency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efficiency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efficient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Specifically we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efficiently converted into an inverted indexing data structure which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing) as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).</p>

One useful strategy is to represent the examples in databases
as compact binary codes through semantic hashing, which
has attracted much attention due to its fast query/search
speed and drastically reduced storage requirement. All of
the current semantic hashing methods only deal with the
case when each example is represented by one type of features.
However, examples are often described from several
different information sources in many real world applications.
For example, the characteristics of a webpage can be
derived from both its content part and its associated links.
To address the problem of learning good hashing codes in
this scenario, we propose a novel research problem – Composite
Hashing with Multiple Information Sources (CHMIS).
The focus of the new research problem is to design an algorithm
for incorporating the features from different information
sources into the binary hashing codes efficiently and
effectively. In particular, we propose an algorithm CHMISAW
(CHMIS with Adjusted Weights) for learning the codes.
The proposed algorithm integrates information from several
different sources into the binary hashing codes by adjusting
the weights on each individual source for maximizing
the coding performance, and enables fast conversion from
query examples to their binary hashing codes. Experimental
results on five different datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method against several other
state-of-the-art semantic hashing techniques.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we propose to (seamlessly) integrate b-bit minwise hashing with linear SVM to substantially improve the training (and testing) efficiency using much smaller memory with essentially no loss of accuracy. Theoretically we prove that the resemblance matrix the minwise hashing matrix and the b-bit minwise hashing matrix are all positive definite matrices (kernels). Interestingly our proof for the positive definiteness of the b-bit minwise hashing kernel naturally suggests a simple strategy to integrate b-bit hashing with linear SVM. Our technique is particularly useful when the data can not fit in memory which is an increasingly critical issue in large-scale machine learning. Our preliminary experimental results on a publicly available webspam dataset (350K samples and 16 million dimensions) verified the effectiveness of our algorithm. For example the training time was reduced to merely a few seconds. In addition our technique can be easily extended to many other linear and nonlinear machine learning applications such as logistic regression.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity joins are important operations with a broad range of applications. In this paper we study the problem of vector similarity join size estimation (VSJ). It is a generalization of the previously studied set similarity join size estimation (SSJ) problem and can handle more interesting cases such as TF-IDF vectors. One of the key challenges in similarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on the input similarity threshold. We propose a sampling based algorithm that uses the Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH) scheme. The proposed algorithm LSH-SS uses an LSH index to enable effective sampling even at high thresholds. We compare the proposed technique with random sampling and the state-of-the-art technique for SSJ (adapted to VSJ) and demonstrate LSH-SS offers more accurate estimates at both high and low similarity thresholds and small variance using real-world data sets.</p>

efficient nearest neighbor search in massive

a challenge. Moreover, in many cases realworld

this paper, we propose a novel graph-based

To make such an approach computationally

tractable low-rank adjacency matrices. Our
formulation allows constant time hashing of a

eigenvectors to eigenfunctions. Finally,
we describe a hierarchical threshold learning
procedure in which each eigenfunction yields
multiple bits, leading to higher search accuracy.

Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based methods have become a very popular approach for this problem. However most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search - i.e. efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this paper we present BayesLSH a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant BayesLSH-Lite which calculates similarities exactly is also presented. BayesLSH is able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally the quality of BayesLSHs output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate generation algorithms AllPairs and LSH BayesLSH enables significant speedups typically in the range 2x-20x for a wide variety of datasets.</p>

The results confirm our prior work that compared with the VW hashing algorithm (which has the same variance as random projections) b-bit minwise hashing is substantially more accurate at the same storage. For example with merely 30 hashed values per data point b-bit minwise hashing can achieve similar accuracies as VW with 2^14 hashed values per data point. We demonstrate that the preprocessing cost of b-bit minwise hashing is roughly on the same order of magnitude as the data loading time. Furthermore by using a GPU the preprocessing cost can be reduced to a small fraction of the data loading time. Minwise hashing has been widely used in industry at least in the context of search. One reason for its popularity is that one can efficiently simulate permutations by (e.g.) universal hashing. In other words there is no need to store the permutation matrix. In this paper we empirically verify this practice by demonstrating that even using the simplest 2-universal hashing does not degrade the learning performance.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing is the standard technique in the context of search and databases for efficiently estimating set (e.g. high-dimensional 0/1 vector) similarities. Recently b-bit minwise hashing was proposed which significantly improves upon the original minwise hashing in practice by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value as opposed to using 64 bits. b-bit hashing is particularly effective in applications which mainly concern sets of high similarities (e.g. the resemblance 0.5). However there are other important applications in which not just pairs of high similarities matter. For example many learning algorithms require all pairwise similarities and it is expected that only a small fraction of the pairs are similar. Furthermore many applications care more about containment (e.g. how much one object is contained by another object) than the resemblance. In this paper we show that the estimators for minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing used in the current practice can be systematically improved and the improvements are most significant for set pairs of low resemblance and high containment.</p>

The former problem has been extensively studied and elegantly solved in high dimensions using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. By contrast the latter problem has a complexity that is still not fully understood. We revisit the analysis of the LSH scheme for exhaustive r-pleb using a somewhat refined notion of locality-sensitive family of hash function which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in the complexity of the problem. Our analysis combined with a non-isometric lifting of the data enables us to answer exhaustive r-pleb queries (and down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way we obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries whose complexity is parametrized by some em condition number measuring the inherent difficulty of a given instance of the problem.</p>

address the limitations of this algorithm, in particular, by choosing more appropriate hash functions to better partition the vector
space. All the proposed extensions, however, rely on a structured quantizer for hashing, poorly fitting real data sets, limiting
its performance in practice. In this paper, we compare several families of space hashing functions in a real setup, namely when
searching for high-dimension SIFT descriptors. The comparison of random projections, lattice quantizers, k-means and hierarchical
k-means reveal that unstructured quantizer significantly improves the accuracy of LSH, as it closely fits the data in the feature space.
We then compare two querying mechanisms introduced in the literature with the one originally proposed in LSH, and discuss their

	<td><p>Similarity search methods are widely used as kernels in various machine learning applications. Nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms are often used to retrieve similar entries given a query. While there exist efficient techniques for exact query lookup using hashing similarity search using exact nearest neighbors is known to be a hard problem and in high dimensions best known solutions offer little improvement over a linear scan. Fast solutions to the approximate NNS problem include Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based techniques which need storage polynomial in n with exponent greater than 1 and query time sublinear but still polynomial in n where n is the size of the database. In this work we present a new technique of solving the approximate NNS problem in Euclidean space using a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) which needs near linear space and has O(1) query time. In fact this method also works around the best known lower bounds in the cell probe model for the query time using a data structure near linear in the size of the data base. TCAMs are high performance associative memories widely used in networking applications such as access control lists. A TCAM can query for a bit vector within a database of ternary vectors where every bit position represents 0 1 or . The is a wild card representing either a 0 or a 1. We leverage TCAMs to design a variant of LSH called Ternary Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) wherein we hash database entries represented by vectors in the Euclidean space into 01. By using the added functionality of a TLSH scheme with respect to the character we solve an instance of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with 1 TCAM access and storage nearly linear in the size of the database. We believe that this work can open new avenues in very high speed data mining.</p>

	<td><p>Large scale image search has recently attracted considerable
attention due to easy availability of huge amounts of
data. Several hashing methods have been proposed to allow
approximate but highly efficient search. Unsupervised
hashing methods show good performance with metric distances
but, in image search, semantic similarity is usually
given in terms of labeled pairs of images. There exist supervised
hashing methods that can handle such semantic similarity
but they are prone to overfitting when labeled data
is small or noisy. Moreover, these methods are usually very
slow to train. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised
hashing method that is formulated as minimizing empirical
error on the labeled data while maximizing variance
and independence of hash bits over the labeled and unlabeled
data. The proposed method can handle both metric as
well as semantic similarity. The experimental results on two
large datasets (up to one million samples) demonstrate its
superior performance over state-of-the-art supervised and
unsupervised methods.</p>

Our second approach embeds the data into a vector space where the Euclidean norm reflects the desired distance between the original points and hyperplane query. Both use hashing to retrieve near points in sub-linear time. Our first methods preprocessing stage is more efficient while the second has stronger accuracy guarantees. We apply both to pool-based active learning taking the current hyperplane classifier as a query our algorithm identifies those points (approximately) satisfying the well-known minimal distance-to-hyperplane selection criterion.

While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits b-bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest b bits (where b= 2 for 3-way). The extension to 3-way similarity from the prior work on 2-way similarity is technically non-trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simplified estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that b-bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 25-fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 3-way resemblance.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is the process of associating a short vector of bits to an image. The resulting summaries are useful in many applications including image indexing image authentication and pattern recognition. These hashes need to be invariant under transformations of the image that result in similar visual content but should drastically differ for conceptually distinct contents. This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a saliency graph connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph that is its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image making the hash robust to image transformation yet distinct for different visual content. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on a set of MRI 2-D slices and on a database of faces.</p>

The dual ternary indexing algorithm is adapted for Carnatic music by segmenting using the segmentation technique for Carnatic music. The dual ternary algorithm is compared with the multi-key hashing algorithm designed by us for indexing and retrieval in which features like MFCC spectral flux melody string and spectral centroid are used as features for indexing data into a hash table. The way in which collision resolution was handled by this hash table is different than the normal hash table approaches. It was observed that multi-key hashing based retrieval had a lesser time complexity than dual-ternary based indexing The algorithms were also compared for their precision and recall in which multi-key hashing had a better recall than modified dual ternary indexing for the sample data considered.</p>

	<td><p>Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text image and video processing. While it is relatively easy to determine a suitable word dictionary for text documents there is no simple mapping from raw images or videos to dictionary terms. The classical approach builds a dictionary using vector quantization over a large set of useful visual descriptors extracted from a training set and uses a nearest-neighbor algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each dictionary word in documents to be encoded. More robust approaches have been proposed recently that represent each visual descriptor as a sparse weighted combination of dictionary words. While favoring a sparse representation at the level of visual descriptors those methods however do not ensure that images have sparse representation. In this work we use mixed-norm regularization to achieve sparsity at the image level as well as a small overall dictionary. This approach can also be used to encourage using the same dictionary words for all the images in a class providing a discriminative signal in the construction of image representations. Experimental results on a benchmark image classification dataset show that when compact image or dictionary representations are needed for computational efficiency the proposed approach yields better mean average precision in classification.</p>

between the orginal vectors. The method is advantageously used in an asymmetric
manner, by computing the distance between a vector and code, unlike
competing techniques such as spectral hashing that only compare codes.
Our approach approximates the Euclidean distance based on memory efficient codes and, thus, permits efficient nearest neighbor search. Experiments
performed on SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy.

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.</p>

	<td><p>Perfect hash functions can potentially be used to compress data in connection with a variety of data management tasks. Though there has been considerable work on how to construct good perfect hash functions there is a gap between theory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On one side there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven practicality for large key sets. On the other side there are the theoretically analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash functions are available for free which is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice using a number of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel theoretically optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods and the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64 for which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the range 0…2n-1 the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e. one bit more than optimal for representing the key). This is significantly below of what has been achieved previously for very large values of n.</p>

While hashing by irreducible polynomials is pairwise independent our implementations either run in time O(n) or use an exponential amount of memory. As a more scalable alternative we make hashing by cyclic polynomials pairwise independent by ignoring n-1 bits. Experimentally we show that hashing by cyclic polynomials is is twice as fast as hashing by irreducible polynomials.

	<td><p>Similarity indices for high-dimensional data are very desirable for building content-based search systems for featurerich data such as audio, images, videos, and other sensor
data. Recently, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its
variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for
approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of
these approaches is the requirement for a large number of
hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH
that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on
the well-known LSH technique, but it intelligently probes
multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in
a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon
recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to
reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We
have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional
datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH
method substantially improves upon previously proposed
methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the
same search quality, multi-probe LSH has a similar timeefficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison
with the entropy-based LSH method, to achieve the same
search quality, multi-probe LSH uses less query time and 5
to 8 times fewer number of hash tables.</p>

hashing”: Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a
way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses.
Documents similar to a query document can then be found
by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits
from the address of the query document. This way of extending the
efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster
than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method.

	<td><p>Hashing with linear probing dates back to the 1950s and is among the most studied algorithms. In recent years it has become one of the most important hash table organizations since it uses the cache of modern computers very well. Unfortunately previous analysis rely either on complicated and space consuming hash functions or on the unrealistic assumption of free access to a truly random hash function. Already Carter and Wegman in their seminal paper on universal hashing raised the question of extending their analysis to linear probing. However we show in this paper that linear probing using a pairwise independent family may have expected em logarithmic cost per operation. On the positive side we show that 5-wise independence is enough to ensure constant expected time per operation. This resolves the question of finding a space and time efficient hash function that provably ensures good performance for linear probing.</p>

R typically consists of entries of standard normal N(0,1). It is well known that random projections preserve pairwise distances (in the expectation). Achlioptas proposed sparse random projections by replacing the N(0,1) entries in R with entries in -1,0,1 with probabilities 1/6, 2/3, 1/6, achieving a threefold speedup in processing time.We recommend using R of entries in -1,0,1 with probabilities 1/2√D, 1-1√D, 1/2√D for achieving a significant √D-fold speedup, with little loss in accuracy.</p>

Most related work has focused on repeatedly hashing the data which is prohibitive for large data sources. We prove that a one-pass one-hash algorithm is sufficient for accurate estimates if the hashing is sufficiently independent. To reduce costs further we investigate recursive random hashing algorithms and show that they are sufficiently independent in practice. We compare our running times with exact counts using suffix arrays and show that while we use hardly any storage we are an order of magnitude faster. The approach further is extended to a one-pass/one-hash computation of n-gram entropy and iceberg counts.

peer-to-peer systems desire distributed similarity indexes with low

Forest which is applicable in all the above contexts. Our index uses the well-known technique of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH),
but improves upon previous designs by (a) eliminating the different data-dependent parameters for which LSH must be constantly hand-tuned, and (b) improving on LSH’s performance guarantees for skewed data distributions while retaining the same storage

The earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions (that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash tables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest neighbor in at least one table. Our approach is different – we use one (or a few) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket containing its nearest neighbor. We show that the number of randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point q required depends on the entropy of the hash value h(p) of a random point p at the same distance from q at its nearest neighbor given q and the locality preserving hash function h chosen randomly from the hash family. Precisely we show that if the entropy I(h(p)qh) = M and g is a bound on the probability that two far-off points will hash to the same bucket then we can find the approximate nearest neighbor in O(n^rho) time and near linear tilde O(n) space where rho = M/log(1/g). Alternatively we can build a data structure of size tilde O(n^1/(1-rho)) to answer queries in tilde O(d) time. By applying this analysis to the locality preserving hash functions in and adjusting the parameters we show that the c nearest neighbor can be computed in time tilde O(n^rho) and near linear space where rho approx 2.06/c as c becomes large.</p>

	<td><p>Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer science and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory and is used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement and is a common activity performed frequently in a variety of applications. Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison and in doing so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity. Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative method for ordering the data than comparison to exceed the linearithmic time complexity boundary on algorithmic performance. The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by hashing which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional sorting algorithm the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time complexity factor – even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.</p>

	<td><p>We present a novel Locality-Sensitive Hashing scheme for the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Problem under lp norm, based on p-stable distributions.Our scheme improves the running time of the earlier algorithm for the case of the lp norm. It also yields the first known provably efficient approximate NN algorithm for the case p&lt;1. We also show that the algorithm finds the exact near neigbhor in O(log n) time for data satisfying certain “bounded growth” condition.Unlike earlier schemes, our LSH scheme works directly on points in the Euclidean space without embeddings. Consequently, the resulting query time bound is free of large factors and is simple and easy to implement. Our experiments (on synthetic data sets) show that the our data structure is up to 40 times faster than kd-tree.</p>

	<td><p>The nearest- or near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety of database applications, usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately,
all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality;
in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence that our
method gives significant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition.
Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50).</p>
