	<td><p>In this paper we show how word embeddings can be used to increase the effectiveness of a state-of-the art Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based first story detection (FSD) system over a standard tweet corpus. Vocabulary mismatch in which related tweets use different words is a serious hindrance to the effectiveness of a modern FSD system. In this case a tweet could be flagged as a first story even if a related tweet which uses different but synonymous words was already returned as a first story. In this work we propose a novel approach to mitigate this problem of lexical variation based on tweet expansion. In particular we propose to expand tweets with semantically related paraphrases identified via automatically mined word embeddings over a background tweet corpus. Through experimentation on a large data stream comprised of 50 million tweets we show that FSD effectiveness can be improved by 9.537; over a state-of-the-art FSD system.</p>

	<td><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of the emerging hashing techniques in large-scale image retrieval. Owing to the great learning capacity deep hashing has become one of the most promising solutions and achieved attractive performance in practice. However without semantic label information the unsupervised deep hashing still remains an open question. In this paper we propose a novel progressive generative hashing (PGH) framework to help learn a discriminative hashing network in an unsupervised way. Different from existing studies it first treats the hash codes as a kind of semantic condition for the similar image generation and simultaneously feeds the original image and its codes into the generative adversarial networks (GANs). The real images together with the synthetic ones can further help train a discriminative hashing network based on a triplet loss. By iteratively inputting the learnt codes into the hash conditioned GANs we can progressively enable the hashing network to discover the semantic relations. Extensive experiments on the widely-used image datasets demonstrate that PGH can significantly outperform stateof-the-art unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>This article studies deep unsupervised hashing which has attracted increasing attention in large-scale image retrieval. The majority of recent approaches usually reconstruct semantic similarity information which then guides the hash code learning. However they still fail to achieve satisfactory performance in reality for two reasons. On the one hand without accurate supervised information these methods usually fail to produce independent and robust hash codes with semantics information well preserved which may hinder effective image retrieval. On the other hand due to discrete constraints how to effectively optimize the hashing network in an end-to-end manner with small quantization errors remains a problem. To address these difficulties we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method called HARR to learn discriminative and high-quality hash codes. To comprehensively explore semantic similarity structure HARR adopts the Winner-Take-All hash to model the similarity structure. Then similarity-preserving hash codes are learned under the reliable guidance of the reconstructed similarity structure. Additionally we improve the quality of hash codes by a bit correlation reduction module which forces the cross-correlation matrix between a batch of hash codes under different augmentations to approach the identity matrix. In this way the generated hash bits are expected to be invariant to disturbances with minimal redundancy which can be further interpreted as an instantiation of the information bottleneck principle. Finally for effective hashing network training we minimize the cosine distances between real-value network outputs and their binary codes for small quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HARR.</p>

	<td><p>In this paper we focus on improving the effectiveness of hashing-based approximate nearest neighbour search. Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds or vice-versa. In our experiments over two standard image datasets we find statistically significant increases in retrieval effectiveness versus a host of state-of-the-art data-dependent and independent hashing models.</p>

	<td><p>Despite significant progress in supervised hashing there are three common limitations of existing methods. First most pioneer methods discretely learn hash codes bit by bit making the learning procedure rather time-consuming. Second to reduce the large complexity of the n by n pairwise similarity matrix most methods apply sampling strategies during training which inevitably results in information loss and suboptimal performance; some recent methods try to replace the large matrix with a smaller one but the size is still large. Third among the methods that leverage the pairwise similarity matrix most of them only encode the semantic label information in learning the hash codes failing to fully capture the characteristics of data. In this paper we present a novel supervised hashing method called Fast Scalable Supervised Hashing (FSSH) which circumvents the use of the large similarity matrix by introducing a pre-computed intermediate term whose size is independent with the size of training data. Moreover FSSH can learn the hash codes with not only the semantic information but also the features of data. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and scalability.

	<td><p>Hashing has attracted widespread attention in image retrieval because of its fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Compared with supervised methods unsupervised hashing methods are more reasonable and suitable for large-scale image retrieval since it is always difficult and expensive to collect true labels of the massive data. Without label information however unsupervised hashing methods can not guarantee the quality of learned binary codes. To resolve this dilemma this paper proposes a novel unsupervised hashing method called Label Self-Adaption Hashing (LSAH) which contains effective hashing function learning part and self-adaption label generation part. In the first part we utilize anchor graph to keep the local structure of the data and introduce joint sparsity into the model to extract effective features for high-quality binary code learning. In the second part a self-adaptive cluster label matrix is learned from the data under the assumption that the nearest neighbor points should have a large probability to be in the same cluster. Therefore the proposed LSAH can make full use of the potential discriminative information of the data to guide the learning of binary code. It is worth noting that LSAH can learn effective binary codes hashing function and cluster labels simultaneously in a unified optimization framework. To solve the resulting optimization problem an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based iterative algorithm is elaborately designed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale data sets indicate the promising performance of the proposed LSAH.</p>

	<td><p>Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far existing methods still suffer from several problems including 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations in this paper we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly our method can benefit from the semantic labels and simultaneously avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover to accurately capture the query variations at the online retrieval stage we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach from various aspects.</p>

Hashing is one of the most widely used methods for its computational and storage efficiency. With the development of deep learning deep hashing methods show more advantages than traditional methods. In this survey we detailedly investigate current deep hashing algorithms including deep supervised hashing and deep unsupervised hashing. Specifically we categorize deep supervised hashing methods into pairwise methods ranking-based methods pointwise methods as well as quantization according to how measuring the similarities of the learned hash codes. Moreover deep unsupervised hashing is categorized into similarity reconstruction-based methods pseudo-label-based methods and prediction-free self-supervised learning-based methods based on their semantic learning manners. We also introduce three related important topics including semi-supervised deep hashing domain adaption deep hashing and multi-modal deep hashing. Meanwhile we present some commonly used public datasets and the scheme to measure the performance of deep hashing algorithms. Finally we discuss some potential research directions in conclusion.</p>

It has been shown that the hashing quality could be boosted by leveraging supervised information into hash function learning. However the existing supervised methods either lack adequate performance or often incur cumbersome model training. In this paper we propose a novel kernel-based supervised hashing model which requires a limited amount of supervised information i.e. similar and dissimilar data pairs and a feasible training cost in achieving high quality hashing. The idea is to map the data to compact binary codes whose Hamming distances are minimized on similar pairs and simultaneously maximized on dissimilar pairs. Our approach is distinct from prior works by utilizing the equivalence between optimizing the code inner products and the Hamming distances. This enables us to sequentially and efficiently train the hash functions one bit at a time yielding very short yet discriminative codes. We carry out extensive experiments on two image benchmarks with up to one million samples demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in searching both metric distance neighbors and semantically similar neighbors with accuracy gains ranging from 1337; to 4637;.</p>

	<td><p>The recent advances in deep neural networks have demonstrated high capability in a wide variety of scenarios. Nevertheless fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented which mainly consists of three components a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator and on the other to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses i.e. triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks including cross-domain digits retrieval image to image and image to video transfers on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing-based cross-modal search which aims to map multiple modality features into binary codes has attracted increasingly attention due to its storage and search efficiency especially in large-scale database retrieval. Recent unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods have shown promising results. However existing approaches typically suffer from two limitations (1) They usually learn cross-modal similarity information separately or in a redundant fusion manner which may fail to capture semantic correlations among instances from different modalities sufficiently and effectively. (2) They seldom consider the sampling and weighting schemes for unsupervised cross-modal hashing resulting in the lack of satisfactory discriminative ability in hash codes. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing method called Joint-modal Distribution-based Similarity Hashing (JDSH) for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Firstly we propose a novel cross-modal joint-training method by constructing a joint-modal similarity matrix to fully preserve the cross-modal semantic correlations among instances. Secondly we propose a sampling and weighting scheme termed the Distribution-based Similarity Decision and Weighting (DSDW) method for unsupervised cross-modal hashing which is able to generate more discriminative hash codes by pushing semantic similar instance pairs closer and pulling semantic dissimilar instance pairs apart. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of JDSH compared with several unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods on two public datasets NUS-WIDE and MIRFlickr.</p>

This paper presents a graph-based unsupervised hashing model to preserve the neighborhood structure of massive data in a discrete code space. We cast the graph hashing problem into a discrete optimization framework which directly learns the binary codes. A tractable alternating maximization algorithm is then proposed to explicitly deal with the discrete constraints yielding high-quality codes to well capture the local neighborhoods. Extensive experiments performed on four large datasets with up to one million samples show that our discrete optimization based graph hashing method obtains superior search accuracy over state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods especially for longer codes.</p>

To fully explore the duality between the two views we propose a collaborative hashing scheme for the data in matrix form to enable fast search in various applications such as image search using bag of words and recommendation using user-item ratings.

	<td><p>Learning to hash has been recognized to accomplish highly efficient storage and retrieval for large-scale visual data. Particularly ranking-based hashing techniques have recently attracted broad research attention because ranking accuracy among the retrieved data is well explored and their objective is more applicable to realistic search tasks. However directly optimizing discrete hash codes without continuous-relaxations on a nonlinear ranking objective is infeasible by either traditional optimization methods or even recent discrete hashing algorithms. To address this challenging issue in this paper we introduce a novel supervised hashing method dubbed Discrete Semantic Ranking Hashing (DSeRH) which aims to directly embed semantic rank orders into binary codes. In DSeRH a generalized Adaptive Discrete Minimization (ADM) approach is proposed to discretely optimize binary codes with the quadratic nonlinear ranking objective in an iterative manner and is guaranteed to converge quickly. Additionally instead of using 0/1 independent labels to form rank orders as in previous works we generate the listwise rank orders from the high-level semantic word embeddings which can quantitatively capture the intrinsic correlation between different categories. We evaluate our DSeRH coupled with both linear and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) hash functions on three image datasets i.e. CIFAR-10 SUN397 and ImageNet100 and the results manifest that DSeRH can outperform the state-of-the-art ranking-based hashing methods.</p>

To make such an approach computationally feasible we utilize Anchor Graphs to obtain tractable low-rank adjacency matrices. Our formulation allows constant time hashing of a new data point by extrapolating graph Laplacian eigenvectors to eigenfunctions.

In this paper we first present a novel multi-view complementary hash table method that learns complementary hash tables from the data with multiple views. For single multiview table using exemplar based feature fusion we approximate the inherent data similarities with a low-rank matrix and learn discriminative hash functions in an efficient way. To build complementary tables and meanwhile maintain scalable training and fast out-of-sample extension an exemplar reweighting scheme is introduced to update the induced low-rank similarity in the sequential table construction framework which indeed brings mutual benefits between tables by placing greater importance on exemplars shared by mis-separated neighbors.

	<td><p>Similarity indices for high-dimensional data are very desirable for building content-based search systems for featurerich data such as audio images videos and other sensor data. Recently locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of these approaches is the requirement for a large number of hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on the well-known LSH technique but it intelligently probes multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH method substantially improves upon previously proposed methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the same search quality multi-probe LSH has a similar timeefficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison with the entropy-based LSH method to achieve the same search quality multi-probe LSH uses less query time and 5 to 8 times fewer number of hash tables.</p>

We demonstrate that this is a sub-optimal bit allocation approach that can easily destroy the neighbourhood structure in the original feature space. Our proposed method dubbed Neighbourhood Preserving Quantization (NPQ) assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds. NPQ exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits. NPQ is not only applicable to LSH but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme. Despite using half the number of hyperplanes NPQ is shown to improve LSH-based retrieval accuracy by up to 6537; compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

Unlike most existing deep hashing methods which use a series of convolution and fully-connected layers to learn binary features we develop a probabilistic framework to infer latent feature representation inside the network. Then we design a struct layer rather than a bottleneck hash layer to obtain binary codes through a simple encoding procedure. By doing these we are able to obtain binary codes discriminatively and generatively. To make it applicable to cross-modal scalable multimedia retrieval we extend our method to a cross-modal deep variational and structural hashing (CM-DVStH). We design a deep fusion network with a struct layer to maximize the correlation between image-text input pairs during the training stage so that a unified binary vector can be obtained. We then design modality-specific hashing networks to handle the out-of-sample extension scenario. Specifically we train a network for each modality which outputs a latent representation that is as close as possible to the binary codes which are inferred from the fusion network. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

	<td><p>Most existing approaches to hashing apply a single form of hash function and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of the method to respond to the data and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here we propose a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. This framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context and simplifies the development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes hashing learning problem into two steps hash bit learning and hash function learning based on the learned bits. The first step can typically be formulated as binary quadratic problems and the second step can be accomplished by training standard binary classifiers. Both problems have been extensively studied in the literature. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p>

Non-linear hash functions have demonstrated their advantage over linear ones due to their powerful generalization capability. In the literature kernel functions are typically used to achieve non-linearity in hashing which achieve encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training time. Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving non-linearity in hashing which are fast to train and evaluate hence more suitable for hashing with high dimensional data. In our approach we first propose sub-modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem and an efficient GraphCut based block search method for solving large-scale inference. Then we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the binary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in retrieval precision and training time. Especially for highdimensional data our method is orders of magnitude faster than many methods in terms of training time.</p>

Discrete hashing methods are thus beneficial because they map high-dimensional data to compact binary codes that are efficient to store and process while preserving semantic similarity. To optimize powerful deep learning methods for image hashing gradient-based methods are required. Binary codes however are discrete and thus have no continuous derivatives. Relaxing the problem by solving it in a continuous space and then quantizing the solution is not guaranteed to yield separable binary codes. The quantization needs to be included in the optimization. In this paper we push for quantization We optimize maximum class separability in the binary space. We introduce a margin on distances between dissimilar image pairs as measured in the binary space. In addition to pair-wise distances we draw inspiration from Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisher LDA) to maximize the binary distances between classes and at the same time minimize the binary distance of images within the same class.

We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k Nus-wide Cifar-10 Mscoco Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>We develop 0-bit consistent weighted sampling (CWS) for efficiently estimating min-max kernel which is a generalization of the resemblance kernel originally designed for binary data. Because the estimator of 0-bit CWS constitutes a positive definite kernel this method can be naturally applied to large-scale data mining problems. Basically if we feed the sampled data from 0-bit CWS to a highly efficient linear classifier (e.g. linear SVM) we effectively (and approximately) train a nonlinear classifier based on the min-max kernel. The accuracy improves as we increase the sample size. In this paper we first demonstrate through an extensive classification study using kernel machines that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. This helps justify the use of min-max kernel. However as the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data we propose to linearize the min-max kernel via 0-bit CWS a simplification of the original CWS method. The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces samples in the form of (i t) where the i records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the t is theoretically unbounded it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. We provide a simple solution by discarding t (which we refer to as the 0-bit scheme). Via an extensive empirical study we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information. We then apply 0-bit CWS for building linear classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers as extensively validated on a wide range of public datasets. We expect this work will generate interests among data mining practitioners who would like to efficiently utilize the nonlinear information of non-binary and nonnegative data.</p>

Recently a number of approaches to learning datadependent hash functions have been developed. In this work we propose a column generation based method for learning datadependent hash functions on the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identi- fied. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a widely-used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. For most existing hashing methods an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. However such visual feature vectors may not be optimally compatible with the coding process thus producing sub-optimal hashing codes. In this paper we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing in which images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image datasets show that the proposed simultaneous feature learning and hash coding pipeline brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art supervised or unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>The last few years have witnessed the rise of the big data era in which approximate nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem in many applications such as large-scale image retrieval. Recently many research results have demonstrated that hashing can achieve promising performance due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. Since complex optimization problems for loss functions are difficult to solve most hashing methods decompose the hash code learning problem into two steps projection and quantization. In the quantization step binary codes are widely used because ranking them by the Hamming distance is very efficient. However the massive information loss produced by the quantization step should be reduced in applications where high search accuracy is required such as in image retrieval. Since many two-step hashing methods produce uneven projected dimensions in the projection step in this paper we propose a novel dimension analysis-based quantization (DAQ) on two-step hashing methods for image retrieval. We first perform an importance analysis of the projected dimensions and select a subset of them that are more informative than others and then we divide the selected projected dimensions into several regions with our quantizer. Every region is quantized with its corresponding codebook. Finally the similarity between two hash codes is estimated by the Manhattan distance between their corresponding codebooks which is also efficient. We conduct experiments on three public benchmarks containing up to one million descriptors and show that the proposed DAQ method consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art quantization methods.</p>

Recent work has explored ways to embed high-dimensional features or complex distance functions into a low-dimensional Hamming space where items can be efficiently searched. However existing methods do not apply for high-dimensional kernelized data when the underlying feature embedding for the kernel is unknown. We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions making it possible to preserve the algorithm’s sub-linear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks. We validate our technique on several large-scale datasets and show that it enables accurate and fast performance for example-based object classification feature matching and content-based retrieval.</p>

In modern settings the compression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional binary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be accurate. In this work we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional binary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not require any side-information like annotated attributes or label meta-data and learns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The learnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal classification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the learnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data by discovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively measure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image retrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For ImageNet-100 retrieval problem our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit HashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real representations. Finally our learnt binary codes can perform OOD detection out-of-the-box as accurately as a baseline that needs ~3000 samples to tune its threshold while we require none.</p>

However due to the large scale of many applications the data is often stored or even collected in a distributed manner. Learning hash functions by aggregating all the data into a fusion center is infeasible because of the prohibitively expensive communication and computation overhead. In this paper we develop a novel hashing model to learn hash functions in a distributed setting. We cast a centralized hashing model as a set of subproblems with consensus constraints. We find these subproblems can be analytically solved in parallel on the distributed compute nodes. Since no training data is transmitted across the nodes in the learning process the communication cost of our model is independent to the data size. Extensive experiments on several large scale datasets containing up to 100 million samples demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary codes for data representation has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive databases due to its fast query speed and low storage cost. Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best binary codes for a given data set mainstream hashing methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the first stage several projected dimensions of real values are generated. Then in the second stage the real values will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding. Currently most existing methods use one single bit to quantize each projected dimension. One problem with this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold typically lies in the region of the highest point density and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing. In this paper we propose a novel quantization strategy called double-bit quantization (DBQ) to solve the problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can signifi- cantly outperform traditional SBQ strategy for hashing.</p>

It allows after a close to linear time preprocessing of the input dataset to find an approximately nearest neighbor of any fixed query in sublinear time in the dataset size. The resulting data structure is randomized and succeeds with high probability for every fixed query. In many modern applications of nearest neighbor search the queries are chosen adaptively. In this paper we study the robustness of the locality-sensitive hashing to adaptive queries in Hamming space. We present a simple adversary that can under mild assumptions on the initial point set provably find a query to the approximate near neighbor search data structure that the data structure fails on.

	<td><p>Deep hashing enables computation and memory efficient image search through end-to-end learning of feature representations and binary codes. While linear scan over binary hash codes is more efficient than over the high-dimensional representations its linear-time complexity is still unacceptable for very large databases. Hamming space retrieval enables constant-time search through hash lookups where for each query there is a Hamming ball centered at the query and the data points within the ball are returned as relevant. Since inside the Hamming ball implies retrievable while outside irretrievable it is crucial to explicitly characterize the Hamming ball. The main idea of this work is to directly embody the Hamming radius into the loss functions leading to Maximum-Margin Hamming Hashing (MMHH) a new model specifically optimized for Hamming space retrieval. We introduce a max-margin t-distribution loss where the t-distribution concentrates more similar data points to be within the Hamming ball and the margin characterizes the Hamming radius such that less penalization is applied to similar data points within the Hamming ball. The loss function also introduces robustness to data noise where the similarity supervision may be inaccurate in practical problems. The model is trained end-to-end using a new semi-batch optimization algorithm tailored to extremely imbalanced data. Our method yields state-of-the-art results on four datasets and shows superior performance on noisy data.</p>

	<td><p>By leveraging semantic (label) information supervised hashing has demonstrated better accuracy than unsupervised hashing in many real applications. Because the hashing-code learning problem is essentially a discrete optimization problem which is hard to solve most existing supervised hashing methods try to solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by dropping the discrete constraints. However these methods typically suffer from poor performance due to the errors caused by the relaxation. Some other methods try to directly solve the discrete optimization problem. However they are typically time-consuming and unscalable. In this paper we propose a novel method called column sampling based discrete supervised hashing (COSDISH) to directly learn the discrete hashing code from semantic information. COSDISH is an iterative method in each iteration of which several columns are sampled from the semantic similarity matrix and then the hashing code is decomposed into two parts which can be alternately optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval.</p>

Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper we propose a novel method called isotropic hashing (IsoHash) to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances).

	<td><p>Following the success of hashing methods for multidimensional indexing more and more works are interested in embedding visual feature space in compact hash codes. Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures but a complementary way to reduce both the memory usage and the distance computation cost. Several data dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to closely fit data distribution and provide better selectivity than usual random projections such as LSH. However improvements occur only for relatively small hash code sizes up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper this is mainly due to the lack of independence between the produced hash functions. We introduce a new hash function family that attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather than boosting the collision probability of close points our method focus on data scattering. By training purely random splits of the data regardless the closeness of the training samples it is indeed possible to generate consistently more independent hash functions. On the other side the use of large margin classifiers allows to maintain good generalization performances. Experiments show that our new Random Maximum Margin Hashing scheme (RMMH) outperforms four state-of-the-art hashing methods notably in kernel spaces.</p>

However the existing general hashing methods have limited discriminative power for describing fine-grained objects that share similar overall appearance but have subtle difference. To solve this problem we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to the learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically we propose a novel deep hashing model named deep saliency hashing (DSaH) which automatically mines salient regions and learns semanticpreserving hashing codes simultaneously. DSaH is a twostep end-to-end model consisting of an attention network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic components including the semantic loss the saliency loss and the quantization loss. As the core of DSaH the saliency loss guides the attention network to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images. We conduct extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine grained dataset including Oxford Flowers-17 Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird demonstrate that our DSaH performs the best for fine-grained retrieval task and beats strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 1037; on both Stanford Dogs-120 and CUB Bird.

A good hashing method should satisfy the following two requirements 1) mapping the nearby data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions which explicitly considers the above two requirements. Specifically CPH aims at sequentially finding a series of hyperplanes (hashing functions) which cross the sparse region of the data. At the same time the data points are evenly distributed in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes. The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images first the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets.</p>

By directly exploiting the similarity to guide the hashing code learning procedure graph hashing has attracted much attention. However most existing graph hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance in real applications due to the high complexity for graph modeling. In this paper we propose a novel method called scalable graph hashing with feature transformation (SGH) for large-scale graph hashing.

However the label-hungry property requires massive label collection making it intractable in practical scenarios. To liberate the model training procedure from laborious manual annotations some unsupervised methods are proposed. However the following two factors make unsupervised algorithms inferior to their supervised counterparts (1) Without manually-defined labels it is difficult to capture the semantic information across data which is of crucial importance to guide robust binary code learning. (2) The widely adopted relaxation on binary constraints results in quantization error accumulation in the optimization procedure. To address the above-mentioned problems in this paper we propose a novel Unsupervised Discrete Hashing method (UDH). Specifically to capture the semantic information we propose a balanced graph-based semantic loss which explores the affinity priors in the original feature space. Then we propose a novel self-supervised loss termed orthogonal consistent loss which can leverage semantic loss of instance and impose independence of codes. Moreover by integrating the discrete optimization into the proposed unsupervised framework the binary constraints are consistently preserved alleviating the influence of quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for image retrieval.</p>

Due to its fast query speed and reduced storage cost hashing has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor search in a large variety of applications like text and image retrieval. Most existing hashing methods adopt Hamming distance to measure the similarity (neighborhood) between points in the hashcode space. However one problem with Hamming distance is that it may destroy the neighborhood structure in the original feature space which violates the essential goal of hashing. In this paper Manhattan hashing (MH) which is based on Manhattan distance is proposed to solve the problem of Hamming distance based hashing. The basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with multiple bits of natural binary code (NBC) based on which the Manhattan distance between points in the hashcode space is calculated for nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the neighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to adopt Manhattan distance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several largescale image data sets containing up to one million points show that our MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years a number of online hashing methods have emerged which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples especially in the multi-label case. In this paper we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

As deep learning has shown its superior performance on many computer vision applications recent designs of learning-based hashing models have been moving from shallow ones to deep architectures. However based on our analysis we find that gradient descent based algorithms used in deep hashing models would potentially cause hash codes of a pair of training instances to be updated towards the directions of each other simultaneously during optimization. In the worst case the paired hash codes switch their directions after update and consequently their corresponding distance in the Hamming space remain unchanged. This makes the overall learning process highly inefficient. To address this issue we propose a new deep hashing model integrated with a novel gradient attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm is able to accelerate the learning process and obtain competitive retrieval performance compared with state-of-the-art deep hashing models.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing due to its low storage cost and high query speed has been successfully used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications. It projects high-dimensional data into a shared isomorphic Hamming space with similar binary codes for semantically-similar data. In some applications all modalities may not be obtained or trained simultaneously for some reasons such as privacy secret storage limitation and computational resource limitation. However most existing cross-modal hashing methods need all modalities to jointly learn the common Hamming space thus hindering them from handling these problems. In this paper we propose a novel approach called Separated Variational Hashing Networks (SVHNs) to overcome the above challenge. Firstly it adopts a label network (LabNet) to exploit available and nonspecific label annotations to learn a latent common Hamming space by projecting each semantic label into a common binary representation. Then each modality-specific network can separately map the samples of the corresponding modality into their binary semantic codes learned by LabNet. We achieve it by conducting variational inference to match the aggregated posterior of the hashing code of LabNet with an arbitrary prior distribution. The effectiveness and efficiency of our SVHNs are verified by extensive experiments carried out on four widely-used multimedia databases in comparison with 11 state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>In the era of big data methods for improving memory and computational efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies. Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary codes. However due to binary constraints the optimization becomes intractable. To mitigate this challenge different relaxation approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is unnecessary. To this end we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore instead of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to the data points we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization techniques namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold to obtain the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets we show that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low complexity.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing based approximate nearest neighbor search embeds high dimensional data to compact binary codes which enables efficient similarity search and storage. However the non-isometry sign(·) function makes it hard to project the nearest neighbors in continuous data space into the closest codewords in discrete Hamming space. In this work we revisit the sign(·) function from the perspective of space partitioning. In specific we bridge the gap between k-nearest neighbors and binary hashing codes with Shannon entropy. We further propose a novel K-Nearest Neighbors Hashing (KNNH) method to learn binary representations from KNN within the subspaces generated by sign(·). Theoretical and experimental results show that the KNN relation is of central importance to neighbor preserving embeddings and the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Deep image hashing aims to map input images into simple binary hash codes via deep neural networks and thus enable effective large-scale image retrieval. Recently hybrid networks that combine convolution and Transformer have achieved superior performance on various computer tasks and have attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless the potential benefits of such hybrid networks in image retrieval still need to be verified. To this end we propose a hybrid convolutional and self-attention deep hashing method known as HybridHash. Specifically we propose a backbone network with stage-wise architecture in which the block aggregation function is introduced to achieve the effect of local self-attention and reduce the computational complexity. The interaction module has been elaborately designed to promote the communication of information between image blocks and to enhance the visual representations. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper has superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.

	<td><p>An effective unsupervised hashing algorithm leads to compact binary codes preserving the neighborhood structure of data as much as possible. One of the most established schemes for unsupervised hashing is to reduce the dimensionality of data and then find a rigid (neighbourhood-preserving) transformation that reduces the quantization error. Although employing rigid transformations is effective we may not reduce quantization loss to the ultimate limits. As well reducing dimensionality and quantization loss in two separate steps seems to be sub-optimal. Motivated by these shortcomings we propose to employ both rigid and non-rigid transformations to reduce quantization error and dimensionality simultaneously. We relax the orthogonality constraint on the projection in a PCA-formulation and regularize this by a quantization term. We show that both the non-rigid projection matrix and rotation matrix contribute towards minimizing quantization loss but in different ways. A scalable nested coordinate descent approach is proposed to optimize this mixed-integer optimization problem. We evaluate the proposed method on five public benchmark datasets providing almost half a million images. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method mostly outperforms state-of-art linear methods and competes with end-to-end deep solutions.</p>

	<td><p>Many binary code encoding schemes based on hashing have been actively studied recently since they can provide efficient similarity search especially nearest neighbor search and compact data representations suitable for handling large scale image databases in many computer vision problems. Existing hashing techniques encode highdimensional data points by using hyperplane-based hashing functions. In this paper we propose a novel hyperspherebased hashing function spherical hashing to map more spatially coherent data points into a binary code compared to hyperplane-based hashing functions. Furthermore we propose a new binary code distance function spherical Hamming distance that is tailored to our hyperspherebased binary coding scheme and design an efficient iterative optimization process to achieve balanced partitioning of data points for each hash function and independence between hashing functions. Our extensive experiments show that our spherical hashing technique significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art hashing techniques based on hyperplanes across various image benchmarks of sizes ranging from one to 75 million of GIST descriptors. The performance gains are consistent and large up to 10037; improvements. The excellent results confirm the unique merits of the proposed idea in using hyperspheres to encode proximity regions in high-dimensional spaces. Finally our method is intuitive and easy to implement.</p>

	<td><p>A deep hashing model typically has two main learning objectives to make the learned binary hash codes discriminative and to minimize a quantization error. With further constraints such as bit balance and code orthogonality it is not uncommon for existing models to employ a large number (4) of losses. This leads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their effectiveness. In this work we propose a novel deep hashing model with only a single learning objective. Specifically we show that maximizing the cosine similarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding binary orthogonal codes can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization error minimization. Further with this learning objective code balancing can be achieved by simply using a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label classification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is an one-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights of various losses. Importantly extensive experiments show that our model is highly effective outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-loss hashing models on three large-scale instance retrieval benchmarks often by significant margins.</p>

We present a content-aware neural hashing-based collaborative filtering approach (NeuHash-CF) which generates binary hash codes for users and items such that the highly efficient Hamming distance can be used for estimating user-item relevance. NeuHash-CF is modelled as an autoencoder architecture consisting of two joint hashing components for generating user and item hash codes. Inspired from semantic hashing the item hashing component generates a hash code directly from an items content information (i.e. it generates cold-start and seen item hash codes in the same manner). This contrasts existing state-of-the-art models which treat the two item cases separately. The user hash codes are generated directly based on user id through learning a user embedding matrix. We show experimentally that NeuHash-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 1237; NDCG and 1337; MRR in cold-start recommendation settings and up to 437; in both NDCG and MRR in standard settings where all items are present while training. Our approach uses 2-4x shorter hash codes while obtaining the same or better performance compared to the state of the art thus consequently also enabling a notable storage reduction.</p>

	<td><p>Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.</p>

Of late there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data e.g. image databases document collections time-series databases and genome databases. Unfortunately all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the curse of dimensionality. That is the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20 searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence that our method gives significant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition. Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50).</p>

The basic idea is to formulate the projections so as to approximately preserve a given similarity function of interest. Having done so one can then search the data efficiently using hash tables or by exploring the Hamming ball volume around a novel query. Both enable sub-linear time retrieval with respect to the database size. Further depending on the design of the projections in some cases it is possible to bound the number of database examples that must be searched in order to achieve a given level of accuracy. This chapter overviews data structures for fast search with binary codes and then describes several supervised and unsupervised strategies for generating the codes. In particular we review supervised methods that integrate metric learning boosting and neural networks into the hash key construction and unsupervised methods based on spectral analysis or kernelized random projections that compute affinity-preserving binary codes.Whether learning from explicit semantic supervision or exploiting the structure among unlabeled data these methods make scalable retrieval possible for a variety of robust visual similarity measures.We focus on defining the algorithms and illustrate the main points with results using millions of images.</p>

	<td><p>This paper proposes a novel deep polarized network (DPN) for learning to hash in which each channel in the network outputs is pushed far away from zero by employing a differentiable bit-wise hinge-like loss which is dubbed as polarization loss. Reformulated within a generic Hamming Distance Metric Learning framework Norouzi et al. 2012 the proposed polarization loss bypasses the requirement to prepare pairwise labels for (dis-)similar items and yet the proposed loss strictly bounds from above the pairwise Hamming Distance based losses. The intrinsic connection between pairwise and pointwise label information as disclosed in this paper brings about the following methodological improvements (a) we may directly employ the proposed differentiable polarization loss with no large deviations incurred from the target Hamming distance based loss; and (b) the subtask of assigning binary codes becomes extremely simple — even random codes assigned to each class suffice to result in state-of-the-art performances as demonstrated in CIFAR10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet100 datasets.</p>

Although lots of approaches have been developed to learn data-dependent hash functions in recent years how to learn hash functions to yield good performance with acceptable computational and memory cost is still a challenging problem. Based on the observation that retrieval precision is highly related to the kNN classification accuracy this paper proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make it scalable well to large problem we propose a factorized neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result the proposed method is able to learn accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and storage cost. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p>

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ImageNet a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale accuracy diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search due to its storage and search efficiency. Recent supervised hashing research has shown that deep learning-based methods can significantly outperform nondeep methods. Most existing supervised deep hashing methods exploit supervisory signals to generate similar and dissimilar image pairs for training. However natural images can have large intraclass and small interclass variations which may degrade the accuracy of hash codes. To address this problem we propose a novel two-stream ConvNet architecture which learns hash codes with class-specific representation centers. Our basic idea is that if we can learn a unified binary representation for each class as a center and encourage hash codes of images to be close to the corresponding centers the intraclass variation will be greatly reduced. Accordingly we design a neural network that leverages label information and outputs a unified binary representation for each class. Moreover we also design an image network to learn hash codes from images and force these hash codes to be close to the corresponding class-specific centers. These two neural networks are then seamlessly incorporated to create a unified end-to-end trainable framework. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks corroborate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the quick development of social websites there are more opportunities to have different media types (such as text image video etc.) describing the same topic from large-scale heterogeneous data sources. To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki MIRFlickr NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO). The results demonstrate that RUCMH can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods especially for the partially paired case which validates the effectiveness of RUCMH.</p>

Recently matrix factorization has achieved great success in cross-modal hashing. However how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy.

	<td><p>Learning to hash is a fundamental technique widely used in large-scale image retrieval. Most existing methods for learning to hash address the involved discrete optimization problem by the continuous relaxation of the binary constraint which usually leads to large quantization errors and consequently suboptimal binary codes. A few discrete hashing methods have emerged recently. However they either completely ignore some useful constraints (specifically the balance and decorrelation of hash bits) or just turn those constraints into regularizers that would make the optimization easier but less accurate. In this paper we propose a novel supervised hashing method named Strongly Constrained Discrete Hashing (SCDH) which overcomes such limitations. It can learn the binary codes for all examples in the training set and meanwhile obtain a hash function for unseen samples with the above mentioned constraints preserved. Although the model of SCDH is fairly sophisticated we are able to find closed-form solutions to all of its optimization subproblems and thus design an efficient algorithm that converges quickly. In addition we extend SCDH to a kernelized version SCDH K . Our experiments on three large benchmark datasets have demonstrated that not only can SCDH and SCDH K achieve substantially higher MAP scores than state-of-the-art baselines but they train much faster than those that are also supervised as well.</p>

In this paper we study the novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for fine-grained images leveraging the search and storage efficiency of hash learning to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints it can firstly obtain both local and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects respectively. Furthermore to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meaning’s consistency of these part-level features across images we design a local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments our proposal consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets which shows our effectiveness. Moreover compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction revealing its efficiency and practicality.</p>

Recently a few discrete multi-modal hashing methods that try to address such issues have emerged but they still ignore several important discrete constraints (such as the balance and decorrelation of hash bits). In this paper we overcome those limitations by proposing a novel method named Enhanced Discrete Multi-modal Hashing (EDMH) which learns binary codes and hashing functions simultaneously from the pairwise similarity matrix of data under the aforementioned discrete constraints. Although the model of EDMH looks a lot more complex than the other models for multi-modal hashing we are actually able to develop a fast iterative learning algorithm for it since the subproblems of its optimization all have closed-form solutions after introducing two auxiliary variables.

	<td><p>Recently a series of deep supervised hashing methods were proposed for binary code learning. However due to the high computation cost and the limited hardwares memory these methods will first select a subset from the training set and then form a mini-batch data to update the network in each iteration. Therefore the remaining labeled data cannot be fully utilized and the model cannot directly obtain the binary codes of the entire training set for retrieval. To address these problems this paper proposes an interesting regularized deep model to seamlessly integrate the advantages of deep hashing and efficient binary code learning by using the anchor graph. As such the deep features and label matrix can be jointly used to optimize the binary codes and the network can obtain more discriminative feedback from the linear combinations of the learned bits. Moreover we also reveal the algorithm mechanism and its computation essence. Experiments on three large-scale datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves better retrieval performance with less training time compared to previous deep hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Computing approximate nearest neighbors in high dimensional spaces is a central problem in large-scale data mining with a wide range of applications in machine learning and data science. A popular and effective technique in computing nearest neighbors approximately is the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme. In this paper we aim to develop LSH schemes for distance functions that measure the distance between two probability distributions particularly for f-divergences as well as a generalization to capture mutual information loss. First we provide a general framework to design LHS schemes for f-divergence distance functions and develop LSH schemes for the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence and triangular discrimination in this framework. We show a two-sided approximation result for approximation of the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence by the Hellinger distance which may be of independent interest. Next we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search. We exemplify this method by applying it to the mutual information loss due to its several important applications such as model compression.</p>

	<td><p>Finding nearest neighbors has become an important operation on databases with applications to text search multimedia indexing and many other areas. One popular algorithm for similarity search especially for high dimensional data (where spatial indexes like kdtrees do not perform well) is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) an approximation algorithm for finding similar objects. In this paper we describe a new variant of LSH called Parallel LSH (PLSH) designed to be extremely efficient capable of scaling out on multiple nodes and multiple cores and which supports highthroughput streaming of new data. Our approach employs several novel ideas including cache-conscious hash table layout using a 2-level merge algorithm for hash table construction; an efficient algorithm for duplicate elimination during hash-table querying; an insert-optimized hash table structure and efficient data expiration algorithm for streaming data; and a performance model that accurately estimates performance of the algorithm and can be used to optimize parameter settings. We show that on a workload where we perform similarity search on a dataset of 1 Billion tweets with hundreds of millions of new tweets per day we can achieve query times of 1–2.5 ms. We show that this is an order of magnitude faster than existing indexing schemes such as inverted indexes. To the best of our knowledge this is the fastest implementation of LSH with table construction times up to 3.7x faster and query times that are 8.3x faster than a basic implementation.</p>

	<td><p>Recently due to the unprecedented growth of multimedia data cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention for the efficient cross-media retrieval. Typically existing methods on crossmodal hashing treat labels of one instance independently but overlook the correlations among labels. Indeed in many real-world scenarios like the online fashion domain instances (items) are labeled with a set of categories correlated by certain hierarchy. In this paper we propose a new end-to-end solution for supervised cross-modal hashing named HiCHNet which explicitly exploits the hierarchical labels of instances. In particular by the pre-established label hierarchy we comprehensively characterize each modality of the instance with a set of layer-wise hash representations. In essence hash codes are encouraged to not only preserve the layerwise semantic similarities encoded by the label hierarchy but also retain the hierarchical discriminative capabilities. Due to the lack of benchmark datasets apart from adapting the existing dataset FashionVC from fashion domain we create a dataset from the online fashion platform Ssense consisting of 15 696 image-text pairs labeled by 32 hierarchical categories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Deep cross-modal hashing further improves the retrieval performance as the deep neural networks can generate more semantic relevant features and hash codes. In this paper we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash coding and propose Deep Joint Semantics Reconstructing Hashing (DJSRH) which has the following two main advantages. First to learn binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure of the original data DJSRH constructs a novel joint-semantics affinity matrix which elaborately integrates the original neighborhood information from different modalities and accordingly is capable to capture the latent intrinsic semantic affinity for the input multi-modal instances. Second DJSRH later trains the networks to generate binary codes that maximally reconstruct above joint-semantics relations via the proposed reconstructing framework which is more competent for the batch-wise training as it reconstructs the specific similarity value unlike the common Laplacian constraint merely preserving the similarity order. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement by DJSRH in various cross-modal retrieval tasks.</p>

	<td><p>To convert the input into binary code hashing algorithm has been widely used for approximate nearest neighbor search on large-scale image sets due to its computation and storage efficiency. Deep hashing further improves the retrieval quality by combining the hash coding with deep neural network. However a major difficulty in deep hashing lies in the discrete constraints imposed on the network output which generally makes the optimization NP hard. In this work we adopt the greedy principle to tackle this NP hard problem by iteratively updating the network toward the probable optimal discrete solution in each iteration. A hash coding layer is designed to implement our approach which strictly uses the sign function in forward propagation to maintain the discrete constraints while in back propagation the gradients are transmitted intactly to the front layer to avoid the vanishing gradients. In addition to the theoretical derivation we provide a new perspective to visualize and understand the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods in both supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the continuous growth of large-scale multi-modal data and increasing requirements for retrieval speed deep cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention recently. Most of existing studies take a similarity matrix as supervision to optimize their models and the inner product between continuous surrogates of hash codes is utilized to depict the similarity in the Hamming space. However all of them merely consider the relevant information to build the similarity matrix ignoring the contribution of the irrelevant one i.e. the categories that samples do not belong to. Therefore they cannot effectively alleviate the effect of dissimilar samples. Moreover due to the modality distribution difference directly utilizing continuous surrogates of hash codes to calculate similarity may induce suboptimal retrieval performance. To tackle these issues in this paper we propose a novel deep normalized cross-modal hashing scheme with bi-direction relation reasoning named Bi_NCMH. Specifically we build the multi-level semantic similarity matrix by considering bi-direction relation i.e. consistent and inconsistent relation. It hence can holistically characterize relations among instances. Besides we execute feature normalization on continuous surrogates of hash codes to eliminate the deviation caused by modality gap which further reduces the negative impact of binarization on retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on two cross-modal benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

We specifically address two central problems 1) how to design an encoder-decoder architecture to generate binary codes for videos; and 2) how to equip the binary codes with the ability of accurate video retrieval. We design a hierarchical binary autoencoder to model the temporal dependencies in videos with multiple granularities and embed the videos into binary codes with less computations than the stacked architecture. Then we encourage the binary codes to simultaneously reconstruct the visual content and neighborhood structure of the videos.

Searching with (un-normalized) inner product as the underlying similarity measure is a known difficult problem and finding hashing schemes for MIPS was considered hard. While the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS in this paper we extend the LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on a key observation that the problem of finding maximum inner products after independent asymmetric transformations can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search in classical settings. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing scheme for MIPS possible. Under the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework this paper provides an example of explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. The proposed hashing scheme leads to significant computational savings over the two popular conventional LSH schemes (i) Sign Random Projection (SRP) and (ii) hashing based on p-stable distributions for L2 norm (L2LSH) in the collaborative filtering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens (10M) datasets.</p>

	<td><p>The query complexity of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based similarity search is dominated by the number of hash evaluations and this number grows with the data size (Indyk amp; Motwani 1998). In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g. text n-grams) minwise hashing is widely adopted which requires applying a large number of permutations on the data. This is costly in computation and energy-consumption. In this paper we propose a hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search using one single permutation. The heart of the proposed hash function is a rotation scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of one permutation hashing (Li et al. 2012) in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent interest for densifying other types of sparse sketches. Using our proposed hashing method the query time of a (K L)-parameterized LSH is reduced from the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely O(KL + dL) where d is the number of nonzeros of the data vector K is the number of hashes in each hash table and L is the number of hash tables. Our experimental evaluation on real data confirms that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the query processing time over minwise hashing without loss in retrieval accuracies.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is widely used to solve fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search problems involves converting the original real-valued samples to binary-valued representations. The conventional quantization strategies such as Single-Bit Quantization and Multi-Bit quantization are considered ineffective because of their serious information loss. To address this issue we propose a novel variable-length quantization (VLQ) strategy for hashing. In the proposed VLQ technique we divide all samples into different regions in each dimension firstly given the real-valued features of samples. Then we compute the dispersion degrees of these regions. Subsequently we attempt to optimally assign different number of bits to each dimensions to obtain the minimum dispersion degree. Our experiments show that the VLQ strategy achieves not only superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods but also has a faster retrieval speed on public datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Machine learning on source code (MLOnCode) is a popular research field that has been driven by the availability of large-scale code repositories and the development of powerful probabilistic and deep learning models for mining source code. Code-to-code recommendation is a task in MLOnCode that aims to recommend relevant diverse and concise code snippets that usefully extend the code currently being written by a developer in their development environment (IDE). Code-to-code recommendation engines hold the promise of increasing developer productivity by reducing context switching from the IDE and increasing code-reuse. Existing code-to-code recommendation engines do not scale gracefully to large codebases exhibiting a linear growth in query time as the code repository increases in size. In addition existing code-to-code recommendation engines fail to account for the global statistics of code repositories in the ranking function such as the distribution of code snippet lengths leading to sub-optimal retrieval results. We address both of these weaknesses with emphSenatus a new code-to-code recommendation engine. At the core of Senatus is emphDe-Skew LSH a new locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that indexes the data for fast (sub-linear time) retrieval while also counteracting the skewness in the snippet length distribution using novel abstract syntax tree-based feature scoring and selection algorithms. We evaluate Senatus via automatic evaluation and with an expert developer user study and find the recommendations to be of higher quality than competing baselines while achieving faster search. For example on the CodeSearchNet dataset we show that Senatus improves performance by 6.737; F1 and query time 16x is faster compared to Facebook Aroma on the task of code-to-code recommendation.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years binary coding techniques are becoming increasingly popular because of their high efficiency in handling large-scale computer vision applications. It has been demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that leverage supervised information can significantly enhance the coding quality and hence greatly benefit visual search tasks. Typically a modern binary coding method seeks to learn a group of coding functions which compress data samples into binary codes. However few methods pursued the coding functions such that the precision at the top of a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized. In this paper we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach namely Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC) which explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train the disciplined coding functions by which the mistakes at the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions we relax the original discrete optimization objective with a continuous surrogate and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost we also design an online learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more efficiently. Empirical studies based upon three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed binary coding approach achieves superior image search accuracy over the state-of-the-arts.</p>

	<td><p>Conventional unsupervised hashing methods usually take advantage of similarity graphs which are either pre-computed in the high-dimensional space or obtained from random anchor points. On the one hand existing methods uncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On the other hand graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce biased prior knowledge of data relevance leading to sub-optimal retrieval performance. In this paper we tackle the above problems by proposing an efficient and adaptive code-driven graph which is updated by decoding in the context of an auto-encoder. Specifically we introduce into our framework twin bottlenecks (i.e. latent variables) that exchange crucial information collaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e. binary codes) conveys the high-level intrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e. continuous variables for low-level detail information) which in turn propagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more discriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally rewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover the proposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating the binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

However one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics and can be related to many recent learning to hash paradigms. We show that when properly designed even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models. Experiments are conducted on conventional large-scale benchmarks i.e. CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and ImageNet where the proposed simple model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32) the graphical model performs semantic hashing Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire document set.</p>

Based on the high waveform similarity between reoccurring earthquakes our application identifies potential earthquakes by searching for similar time series segments via LSH. However a straightforward implementation of this LSH-enabled application has difficulty scaling beyond 3 months of continuous time series data measured at a single seismic station. As a case study of a data-driven science workflow we illustrate how domain knowledge can be incorporated into the workload to improve both the efficiency and result quality. We describe several end-toend optimizations of the analysis pipeline from pre-processing to post-processing which allow the application to scale to time series data measured at multiple seismic stations. Our optimizations enable an over 100× speedup in the end-to-end analysis pipeline. This improved scalability enabled seismologists to perform seismic analysis on more than ten years of continuous time series data from over ten seismic stations and has directly enabled the discovery of 597 new earthquakes near the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California and 6123 new earthquakes in New Zealand.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However the cost of annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new domain. Moreover the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage may come from different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semisupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented which mainly consists of four components a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained endto-end by jointly optimizing three losses i.e. adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep hash models.</p>

	<td><p>It is well known that high-dimensional nearest-neighbor retrieval is very expensive. Dramatic performance gains are obtained using approximate search schemes such as the popular Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Several extensions have been proposed to address the limitations of this algorithm in particular by choosing more appropriate hash functions to better partition the vector space. All the proposed extensions however rely on a structured quantizer for hashing poorly fitting real data sets limiting its performance in practice. In this paper we compare several families of space hashing functions in a real setup namely when searching for high-dimension SIFT descriptors. The comparison of random projections lattice quantizers k-means and hierarchical k-means reveal that unstructured quantizer significantly improves the accuracy of LSH as it closely fits the data in the feature space. We then compare two querying mechanisms introduced in the literature with the one originally proposed in LSH and discuss their respective merits and limitations.</p>

We show a novel way of integrating paraphrases with locality sensitive hashing (LSH) in order to obtain an efficient FSD system that can scale to very large datasets.

	<td><p>Although hashing techniques have been popular for the large scale similarity search problem most of the existing methods for designing optimal hash functions focus on homogeneous similarity assessment i.e. the data entities to be indexed are of the same type. Realizing that heterogeneous entities and relationships are also ubiquitous in the real world applications there is an emerging need to retrieve and search similar or relevant data entities from multiple heterogeneous domains e.g. recommending relevant posts and images to a certain Facebook user. In this paper we address the problem of comparing apples to oranges under the large scale setting. Specifically we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Hashing (RaHH) which provides a general framework for generating hash codes of data entities sitting in multiple heterogeneous domains. Unlike some existing hashing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space the RaHH approach constructs a Hamming space for each type of data entities and learns optimal mappings between them simultaneously. This makes the learned hash codes flexibly cope with the characteristics of different data domains. Moreover the RaHH framework encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous relationships between the data entities to design hash functions with improved accuracy. To validate the proposed RaHH method we conduct extensive evaluations on two large datasets; one is crawled from a popular social media sites Tencent Weibo and the other is an open dataset of Flickr(NUS-WIDE). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RaHH outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods with significant performance gains.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing methods typically aim to preserve the similarity between data points in a feature space by mapping them to binary hash codes. However these methods often overlook the fact that the similarity between data points in the continuous feature space may not be preserved in the discrete hash code space due to the limited similarity range of hash codes. The similarity range is bounded by the code length and can lead to a problem known as similarity collapse. That is the positive and negative pairs of data points become less distinguishable from each other in the hash space. To alleviate this problem in this paper a novel Simialrity Distribution Calibration (SDC) method is introduced. SDC aligns the hash code similarity distribution towards a calibration distribution (e.g. beta distribution) with sufficient spread across the entire similarity range thus alleviating the similarity collapse problem. Extensive experiments show that our SDC outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art alternatives on coarse category-level and instance-level image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>The pervasiveness of massive data repositories has led to much interest in efficient methods for indexing search and retrieval. For image data a rapidly developing body of work for these applications shows impressive performance with methods that broadly fall under the umbrella term of Binary Hashing. Given a distance matrix a binary hashing algorithm solves for a binary code for the given set of examples whose Hamming distance nicely approximates the original distances. The formulation is non-convex — so existing solutions adopt spectral relaxations or perform coordinate descent (or quantization) on a surrogate objective that is numerically more tractable. In this paper we first derive an Augmented Lagrangian approach to optimize the standard binary Hashing objective (i.e. maintain fidelity with a given distance matrix). With appropriate step sizes we find that this scheme already yields results that match or substantially outperform state of the art methods on most benchmarks used in the literature. Then to allow the model to scale to large datasets we obtain an interesting reformulation of the binary hashing objective as a non-negative matrix factorization. Later this leads to a simple multiplicative updates algorithm — whose parallelization properties are exploited to obtain a fast GPU based implementation. We give a probabilistic analysis of our initialization scheme and present a range of experiments to show that the method is simple to implement and competes favorably with available methods (both for optimization and generalization).</p>

While proxy embeddings achieve good performance on both tasks they are non-trivial to binarize due to a rotational ambiguity that encourages non-binary embeddings. The use of a fixed set of proxies (weights of the CNN classification layer) is proposed to eliminate this ambiguity and a procedure to design proxy sets that are nearly optimal for both classification and hashing is introduced. The resulting hash-consistent large margin (HCLM) proxies are shown to encourage saturation of hashing units thus guaranteeing a small binarization error while producing highly discriminative hash-codes. A semantic extension (sHCLM) aimed to improve hashing performance in a transfer scenario is also proposed. Extensive experiments show that sHCLM embeddings achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art hashing procedures on several small and large datasets both within and beyond the set of training classes.</p>

	<td><p>This paper tackles a rarely explored but critical problem within learning to hash i.e. to learn hash codes that effectively discriminate hard similar and dissimilar examples to empower large-scale image retrieval. Hard similar examples refer to image pairs from the same semantic class that demonstrate some shared appearance but have different fine-grained appearance. Hard dissimilar examples are image pairs that come from different semantic classes but exhibit similar appearance. These hard examples generally have a small distance due to the shared appearance. Therefore effective encoding of the hard examples can well discriminate the relevant images within a small Hamming distance enabling more accurate retrieval in the top-ranked returned images. However most existing hashing methods cannot capture this key information as their optimization is dominated byeasy examples i.e. distant similar/dissimilar pairs that share no or limited appearance. To address this problem we introduce a novel Gamma distribution-enabled and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence-based loss which is dubbed dual hinge loss because it works similarly as imposing two smoothed hinge losses on the respective similar and dissimilar pairs. Specifically the loss enforces exponentially variant penalization on the hard similar (dissimilar) examples to emphasize and learn their fine-grained difference. It meanwhile imposes a bounding penalization on easy similar (dissimilar) examples to prevent the dominance of the easy examples in the optimization while preserving the high-level similarity (dissimilarity). This enables our model to well encode the key information carried by both easy and hard examples. Extensive empirical results on three widely-used image retrieval datasets show that (i) our method consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods using hash codes of the same length and (ii) our method can use significantly (e.g. 5037;-7537;) shorter hash codes to perform substantially better than or comparably well to the competing methods.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing framework called Deep Incremental Hashing Network (DIHN) for learning hash codes in an incremental manner. DIHN learns the hash codes for the new coming images directly while keeping the old ones unchanged.

In this paper we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space.

	<td><p>Hashing is a popular approximate nearest neighbor search approach for large-scale image retrieval. Supervised hashing which incorporates similarity/dissimilarity information on entity pairs to improve the quality of hashing function learning has recently received increasing attention. However in the existing supervised hashing methods for images an input image is usually encoded by a vector of hand-crafted visual features. Such hand-crafted feature vectors do not necessarily preserve the accurate semantic similarities of images pairs which may often degrade the performance of hashing function learning. In this paper we propose a supervised hashing method for image retrieval in which we automatically learn a good image representation tailored to hashing as well as a set of hash functions. The proposed method has two stages. In the first stage given the pairwise similarity matrix S over training images we propose a scalable coordinate descent method to decompose S into a product of HHT where H is a matrix with each of its rows being the approximate hash code associated to a training image. In the second stage we propose to simultaneously learn a good feature representation for the input images as well as a set of hash functions via a deep convolutional network tailored to the learned hash codes in H and optionally the discrete class labels of the images. Extensive empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets with different kinds of images show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing-based fast nearest neighbor search technique has attracted great attention in both research and industry areas recently. Many existing hashing approaches encode data with projection-based hash functions and represent each projected dimension by 1-bit. However the dimensions with high variance hold large energy or information of data but treated equivalently as dimensions with low variance which leads to a serious information loss. In this paper we introduce a novel hashing algorithm called Harmonious Hashing which aims at learning hash functions with low information loss. Specifically we learn a set of optimized projections to preserve the maximum cumulative energy and meet the constraint of equivalent variance on each dimension as much as possible. In this way we could minimize the information loss after binarization. Despite the extreme simplicity our method outperforms superiorly to many state-of-the-art hashing methods in large-scale and high-dimensional nearest neighbor search experiments.</p>

By relaxing the original problem we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel datapoint.

	<td><p>en a surge of interest in methods based on semantic hashing i.e. compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with similarity. In reviewing and comparing existing methods we show that their relative performance can change drastically depending on the definition of ground-truth neighbors. Motivated by this finding we propose a new formulation for learning binary codes which seeks to reconstruct the affinity between datapoints rather than their distances. We show that this criterion is intractable to solve exactly but a spectral relaxation gives an algorithm where the bits correspond to thresholded eigenvectors of the affinity matrix and as the number of datapoints goes to infinity these eigenvectors converge to eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operators similar to the recently proposed Spectral Hashing (SH) method. Unlike SH whose performance may degrade as the number of bits increases the optimal code using our formulation is guaranteed to faithfully reproduce the affinities as the number of bits increases. We show that the number of eigenfunctions needed may increase exponentially with dimension but introduce a kernel trick to allow us to compute with an exponentially large number of bits but using only memory and computation that grows linearly with dimension. Experiments shows that MDSH outperforms the state-of-the art especially in the challenging regime of small distance thresholds.</p>

It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper we propose an Attribute-Aware hashing Network (A-Net) for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically based on the captured visual representations by attention we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. A-Net is also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to enhance their representation abilities. Finally the required hash codes are generated by the attribute vectors driven by preserving original similarities. Qualitative experiments on five benchmark fine-grained datasets show our superiority over competing methods. More importantly quantitative results demonstrate the obtained hash codes can strongly correspond to certain kinds of crucial properties of fine-grained objects.</p>

Previous efforts formulate video hashing as training a binary auto-encoder for which noncontinuous latent representations are optimized by the biased straight-through (ST) back-propagation heuristic. We propose to formulate video hashing as learning a discrete variational auto-encoder with the factorized Bernoulli latent distribution termed as Bernoulli variational auto-encoder (BerVAE). The corresponding evidence lower bound (ELBO) in our BerVAE implementation leads to closed-form gradient expression which can be applied to achieve principled training along with some other unbiased gradient estimators. BerVAE enables uncertainty-aware video hashing by predicting the probability distribution of video hash code-words thus providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Experiments on both simulated and real-world large-scale video data demonstrate that our BerVAE trained with unbiased gradient estimators can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Furthermore we show that quantified uncertainty is highly correlated to video retrieval performance which can be leveraged to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

	<td><p>The problem of cross-modal similarity search which aims at making efficient and accurate queries across multiple domains has become a significant and important research topic. Composite quantization a compact coding solution superior to hashing techniques has shown its effectiveness for similarity search. However most existing works utilizing composite quantization to search multi-domain content only consider either pairwise similarity information or class label information across different domains which fails to tackle the semi-supervised problem in composite quantization. In this paper we address the semi-supervised quantization problem by considering (i) pairwise similarity information (without class label information) across different domains which captures the intra-document relation (ii) cross-domain data with class label which can help capture inter-document relation and (iii) cross-domain data with neither pairwise similarity nor class label which enables the full use of abundant unlabelled information. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to consider both supervised information (pairwise similarity + class label) and unsupervised information (neither pairwise similarity nor class label) simultaneously in composite quantization. A challenging problem arises how can we jointly handle these three sorts of information across multiple domains in an efficient way To tackle this challenge we propose a novel semi-supervised deep quantization (SSDQ) model that takes both supervised and unsupervised information into account. The proposed SSDQ model is capable of incorporating the above three kinds of information into one single framework when utilizing composite quantization for accurate and efficient queries across different domains. More specifically we employ a modified deep autoencoder for better latent representation and formulate pairwise similarity loss supervised quantization loss as well as unsupervised distribution match loss to handle all three types of information. The extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement of SSDQ over several state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</p>

However deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in hashing-based retrieval field. In this paper we propose a novel prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN) which formulates a flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing attack. To the best of our knowledge this is the first generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally our proposed framework consists of three parts i.e. a PrototypeNet a generator and a discriminator. Specifically the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. Moreover the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for flexible targeted attack. Particularly the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Furthermore the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic representation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack methods of deep hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal hashing has been widely investigated recently for its efficiency in large-scale cross-media retrieval. However most existing cross-modal hashing methods learn hash functions in a batch-based learning mode. Such mode is not suitable for large-scale data sets due to the large memory consumption and loses its efficiency when training streaming data. Online cross-modal hashing can deal with the above problems by learning hash model in an online learning process. However existing online cross-modal hashing methods cannot update hash codes of old data by the newly learned model. In this paper we propose Online Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (OCMFH) based on collective matrix factorization hashing (CMFH) which can adaptively update hash codes of old data according to dynamic changes of hash model without accessing to old data. Specifically it learns discriminative hash codes for streaming data by collective matrix factorization in an online optimization scheme. Unlike conventional CMFH which needs to load the entire data points into memory the proposed OCMFH retrains hash functions only by newly arriving data points. Meanwhile it generates hash codes of new data and updates hash codes of old data by the latest updated hash model. In such way hash codes of new data and old data are well-matched. Furthermore a zero mean strategy is developed to solve the mean-varying problem in the online hash learning process. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMFH on online cross-media retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Multimodal hashing is essential to cross-media similarity search for its low storage cost and fast query speed. Most existing multimodal hashing methods embedded heterogeneous data into a common low-dimensional Hamming space and then rounded the continuous embeddings to obtain the binary codes. Yet they usually neglect the inherent discrete nature of hashing for relaxing the discrete constraints which will cause degraded retrieval performance especially for long codes. For this purpose a novel Semantic Topic Multimodal Hashing (STMH) is developed by considering latent semantic information in coding procedure. It first discovers clustering patterns of texts and robust factorizes the matrix of images to obtain multiple semantic topics of texts and concepts of images. Then the learned multimodal semantic features are transformed into a common subspace by their correlations. Finally each bit of unified hash code can be generated directly by figuring out whether a topic or concept is contained in a text or an image. Therefore the obtained model by STMH is more suitable for hashing scheme as it directly learns discrete hash codes in the coding process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Traditional single-bit quantization (SBQ) in most hashing methods incurs lots of quantization error which seriously degrades the search performance. To address the limitation of SBQ researchers have proposed promising multi-bit quantization (MBQ) methods to quantize each projection dimension with multiple bits. However some MBQ methods need to adopt specific distance for binary code matching instead of the original Hamming distance which would significantly decrease the retrieval speed. Two typical MBQ methods Hierarchical Quantization and Double Bit Quantization retain the Hamming distance but both of them only consider the projection dimensions during quantization ignoring the neighborhood structure of raw data inherent in Euclidean space. In this paper we propose a multi-bit quantization method named Hamming Compatible Quantization (HCQ) to preserve the capability of similarity metric between Euclidean space and Hamming space by utilizing the neighborhood structure of raw data.

	<td><p>Semantic hashing is a powerful paradigm for representing texts as compact binary hash codes. The explosion of short text data has spurred the demand of few-bits hashing. However the performance of existing semantic hashing methods cannot be guaranteed when applied to few-bits hashing because of severe information loss. In this paper we present a simple but effective unsupervised neural generative semantic hashing method with a focus on few-bits hashing. Our model is built upon variational autoencoder and represents each hash bit as a Bernoulli variable which allows the model to be end-to-end trainable. To address the issue of information loss we introduce a set of auxiliary implicit topic vectors. With the aid of these topic vectors the generated hash codes are not only low-dimensional representations of the original texts but also capture their implicit topics. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art semantic hashing methods in few-bits hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing techniques have recently been successfully applied to solve similarity search problems in the information retrieval field because of their significantly reduced storage and high-speed search capabilities. However the hash codes learned from most recent cross-modal hashing methods lack the ability to comprehensively preserve adequate information resulting in a less than desirable performance. To solve this limitation we propose a novel method termed Nonlinear Robust Discrete Hashing (NRDH) for cross-modal retrieval. The main idea behind NRDH is motivated by the success of neural networks i.e. nonlinear descriptors in the field of representation learning and the use of nonlinear descriptors instead of simple linear transformations is more in line with the complex relationships that exist between common latent representation and heterogeneous multimedia data in the real world. In NRDH we first learn a common latent representation through nonlinear descriptors to encode complementary and consistent information from the features of the heterogeneous multimedia data. Moreover an asymmetric learning scheme is proposed to correlate the learned hash codes with the common latent representation. Empirically we demonstrate that NRDH is able to successfully generate a comprehensive common latent representation that significantly improves the quality of the learned hash codes. Then NRDH adopts a linear learning strategy to fast learn the hash function with the learned hash codes. Extensive experiments performed on two benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of NRDH over several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

We introduce AdaLabelHash a binary hash function learning approach via deep neural networks in this paper. In AdaLabelHash class label representations are variables that are adapted during the backward network training procedure. We express the labels as hypercube vertices in a K-dimensional space and the class label representations together with the network weights are updated in the learning process. As the label representations (or referred to as codewords in this work) are learned from data semantically similar classes will be assigned with the codewords that are close to each other in terms of Hamming distance in the label space. The codewords then serve as the desired output of the hash function learning and yield compact and discriminating binary hash representations. AdaLabelHash is easy to implement which can jointly learn label representations and infer compact binary codes from data. It is applicable to both supervised and semi-supervised hash. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the satisfactory performance of AdaLabelHash.</p>

Specifically we investigate the relationship between the initial noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by a Bayes optimal classifier. We show that under a mild assumption some data pairs of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the Bayes optimal classifier can be potentially distilled. Inspired by this fact we design a simple yet effective strategy to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hash functions from the distilled data set.

While a variety of deep hashing methods have been proposed in recent years most of them are confronted by the dilemma to obtain optimal binary codes in a truly end-to-end manner with nonsmooth sign activations. Unlike existing methods which usually employ a general relaxation framework to adapt to the gradient-based algorithms our approach formulates the non-smooth part of the hashing network as sampling with a stochastic policy so that the retrieval performance degradation caused by the relaxation can be avoided. Specifically our method directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation where the network can be trained directly via policy gradient. Hence the differentiation challenge for discrete optimization can be naturally addressed which leads to effective gradients and binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has become a hot topic recently. Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However current UCMH methods calculate the similarity between two data mainly relying on the two datas cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space because the cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the complex data relationships such as situations where two data have different feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper we devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN). Specifically DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors. DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three types of data similarities (i.e. the graph-neighbor coherence the coexistent similarity and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization errors during hashing. Essentially DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity problem by exploring and exploiting the datas intrinsic relationships in a graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN e.g. by improving the mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit hashing codes to retrieval texts from images. We will release the source code package and the trained model on https://github.com/Atmegal/DGCPN.</p>

In this work we propose a new global similarity metric termed as central similarity with which the hash codes for similar data pairs are encouraged to approach a common center and those for dissimilar pairs to converge to different centers to improve hash learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy. We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept i.e. hash center that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally we propose the Central Similarity Hashing (CSH) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. The CSH is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval demonstrate CSH can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs and achieve noticeable boost in retrieval performance i.e. 337;-2037; in mAP over the previous state-of-the-art.

To address this problem we propose Circulant Binary Embedding (CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant matrix. The circulant structure enables the use of Fast Fourier Transformation to speed up the computation. Compared to methods that use unstructured matrices the proposed method improves the time complexity from O(d^2 ) to O(d log d) and the space complexity from O(d^2) to O(d) where d is the input dimensionality. We also propose a novel time-frequency alternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections which alternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. We show by extensive experiments that the proposed approach gives much better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches for fixed time and provides much faster computation with no performance degradation for fixed number of bits.</p>

A popular strategy is to represent original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of machine learning methods have been utilized but they often lack expressiveness and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex data. Especially deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural networks which is very suitable for text modeling. However little work has leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing. In this paper we propose a series of novel deep document generative models for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides a principled framework for model extension uncertainty estimation simulation and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.</p>

However existing hashing methods all try to learn binary codes from artificially balanced datasets which are not commonly available in real-world scenarios. In this paper we propose Long-Tail Hashing Network (LTHNet) a novel two-stage deep hashing approach that addresses the problem of learning to hash for more realistic datasets where the data labels roughly exhibit a long-tail distribution. Specifically the first stage is to learn relaxed embeddings of the given dataset with its long-tail characteristic taken into account via an end-to-end deep neural network; the second stage is to binarize those obtained embeddings. A critical part of LTHNet is its extended dynamic meta-embedding module which can adaptively realize visual knowledge transfer between head and tail classes and thus enrich image representations for hashing. Our experiments have shown that LTHNet achieves dramatic performance improvements over all state-of-the-art competitors on long-tail datasets with no or little sacrifice on balanced datasets. Further analyses reveal that while to our surprise directly manipulating class weights in the loss function has little effect the extended dynamic meta-embedding module the usage of cross-entropy loss instead of square loss and the relatively small batch-size for training all contribute to LTHNet’s success.</p>

	<td><p>Cross-modal similarity retrieval is a problem about designing a retrieval system that supports querying across content modalities e.g. using an image to retrieve for texts. This paper presents a compact coding solution for efficient cross-modal retrieval with a focus on the quantization approach which has already shown the superior performance over the hashing solutions in single-modal similarity retrieval. We propose a collective deep quantization (CDQ) approach which is the first attempt to introduce quantization in end-to-end deep architecture for cross-modal retrieval. The major contribution lies in jointly learning deep representations and the quantizers for both modalities using carefully-crafted hybrid networks and well-specified loss functions. In addition our approach simultaneously learns the common quantizer codebook for both modalities through which the crossmodal correlation can be substantially enhanced. CDQ enables efficient and effective cross-modal retrieval using inner product distance computed based on the common codebook with fast distance table lookup. Extensive experiments show that CDQ yields state of the art cross-modal retrieval results on standard benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its computation efficiency and retrieval quality hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval while deep hashing further improves the retrieval quality by end-toend representation learning and hash coding. With compact hash codes Hamming space retrieval enables the most efficient constant-time search that returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query by hash table lookups instead of linear scan. However subject to the weak capability of concentrating relevant images to be within a small Hamming ball due to mis-specified loss functions existing deep hashing methods may underperform for Hamming space retrieval. This work presents Deep Cauchy Hashing (DCH) a novel deep hashing model that generates compact and concentrated binary hash codes to enable efficient and effective Hamming space retrieval. The main idea is to design a pairwise cross-entropy loss based on Cauchy distribution which penalizes significantly on similar image pairs with Hamming distance larger than the given Hamming radius threshold. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DCH can generate highly concentrated hash codes and yield state-of-the-art Hamming space retrieval performance on three datasets NUS-WIDE CIFAR-10 and MS-COCO.</p>

To overcome these challenges we propose an online learning algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent in which the hash functions are updated iteratively with streaming data.

This performance improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets which highlights the need to learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks.

We propose an indexing scheme called LSH Forest which is applicable in all the above contexts. Our index uses the well-known technique of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) but improves upon previous designs by (a) eliminating the different data-dependent parameters for which LSH must be constantly hand-tuned and (b) improving on LSH’s performance guarantees for skewed data distributions while retaining the same storage and query overhead. We show how to construct this index in main memory on disk in parallel systems and in peer-to-peer systems. We evaluate the design with experiments on multiple text corpora and demonstrate both the self-tuning nature and the superior performance of LSH Forest.</p>

Oftentimes these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real datasets but almost always come at the cost of losing the guarantees of either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries or apply to datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper we design an NNS algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially matching that of theoretical algorithms while optimizing the hashing to the structure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on the minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithms ability to optimize for a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical side we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much better than the standard theoretical one.

	<td><p>In recent years many hashing methods have been proposed for the cross-modal retrieval task. However there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example some of them relax the binary constraints to generate the hash codes which may generate large quantization error. Although some discrete schemes have been proposed most of them are time-consuming. In addition most of the existing supervised hashing methods use an n x n similarity matrix during the optimization making them unscalable. To address these issues in this paper we present a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method—Scalable disCRete mATrix faCtorization Hashing SCRATCH for short. It leverages the collective matrix factorization on the kernelized features and the semantic embedding with labels to find a latent semantic space to preserve the intra- and inter-modality similarities. In addition it incorporates the label matrix instead of the similarity matrix into the loss function. Based on the proposed loss function and the iterative optimization algorithm it can learn the hash functions and binary codes simultaneously. Moreover the binary codes can be generated discretely reducing the quantization error generated by the relaxation scheme. Its time complexity is linear to the size of the dataset making it scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets namely Wiki MIRFlickr-25K and NUS-WIDE have verified that our proposed SCRATCH model outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval.</p>

This work presents HashNet a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training until it eventually goes back to being the original difficult to optimize deep network with the sign activation function.

	<td><p>Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is in principle an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models but previous researchers who have tried this have found it difficult to learn a good set of filters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels we show that object recognition is significantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of web images hashing has received increasing interests in large scale image retrieval. Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multilabel images. In our approach deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-theart hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.</p>

A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper we emphasise this issue and propose a novel SelfTaught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing we first find the optimal l-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning and then train l classifiers via supervised learning to predict the l-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms stateof-the-art techniques significantly.</p>

Despite the great success achieved unsupervised cross-modal hashing still suffers from lacking reliable similarity supervision and struggles with handling the heterogeneity issue between different modalities. To cope with these in this paper we devise a new deep hashing model termed as High-order Nonlocal Hashing (HNH) to facilitate cross-modal retrieval with the following advantages. First different from existing methods that mainly leverage low-level local-view similarity as the guidance for hashing learning we propose a high-order affinity measure that considers the multi-modal neighbourhood structures from a nonlocal perspective thereby comprehensively capturing the similarity relationships between data items. Second a common representation is introduced to correlate different modalities. By enforcing the modal-specific descriptors and the common representation to be aligned with each other the proposed HNH significantly bridges the modality gap and maintains the intra-consistency. Third an effective affinity preserving objective function is delicately designed to generate high-quality binary codes. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of the proposed HNH in unsupervised cross-modal retrieval tasks over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Deep hashing the state-of-the-art fast image retrieval scheme introduces deep learning to learn the hash functions and generate binary hash codes and outperforms the other image retrieval methods in terms of accuracy. However all the existing deep hashing methods could only generate one level hash codes and require a linear traversal of all the hash codes to figure out the closest one when a new query arrives which is very time-consuming and even intractable for large scale applications. In this work we propose a Hierarchical Deep Hashing(HDHash) scheme to speed up the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. More specifically hierarchical deep hash codes of multiple levels can be generated and indexed with tree structures rather than linear ones and pruning irrelevant branches can sharply decrease the retrieval time. To our best knowledge this is the first work to introduce hierarchical indexed deep hashing for fast large scale image retrieval. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed HDHash scheme achieves better or comparable accuracy with significantly improved efficiency and reduced memory as compared to state-of- the-art fast image retrieval schemes.</p>

However large-scale face image retrieval with significant intra-class variations is still challenging. Neither existing pairwise/triplet labels-based nor softmax classification loss-based deep hashing works can generate compact and discriminative binary codes. Considering these issues we propose a center-based framework integrating end-to-end hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. The framework minimizes the intra-class variance by clustering intra-class samples into a learnable class center. To strengthen inter-class separability it additionally imposes a novel regularization term to enlarge the Hamming distance between pairwise class centers. Moreover a simple yet effective regression matrix is introduced to encourage intra-class samples to generate the same binary codes which further enhances the hashing codes compactness. Experiments on four large-scale datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under various code lengths and commonly-used evaluation metrics.</p>

	<td><p>Extracting informative image features and learning effective approximate hashing functions are two crucial steps in image retrieval . Conventional methods often study these two steps separately e.g. learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency i.e. images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.</p>

In most existing binary hashing methods the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient however in practice there are often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to a query which makes this distance measure ambiguous and poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is important. In this paper we propose a weighted Hamming distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level weights to different hash bits the returned binary codes are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p>

One useful strategy is to represent the examples in databases as compact binary codes through semantic hashing which has attracted much attention due to its fast query/search speed and drastically reduced storage requirement. All of the current semantic hashing methods only deal with the case when each example is represented by one type of features. However examples are often described from several different information sources in many real world applications. For example the characteristics of a webpage can be derived from both its content part and its associated links. To address the problem of learning good hashing codes in this scenario we propose a novel research problem – Composite Hashing with Multiple Information Sources (CHMIS). The focus of the new research problem is to design an algorithm for incorporating the features from different information sources into the binary hashing codes efficiently and effectively. In particular we propose an algorithm CHMISAW (CHMIS with Adjusted Weights) for learning the codes. The proposed algorithm integrates information from several different sources into the binary hashing codes by adjusting the weights on each individual source for maximizing the coding performance and enables fast conversion from query examples to their binary hashing codes. Experimental results on five different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against several other state-of-the-art semantic hashing techniques.</p>

Many hashing approaches have been proposed for the cross-media search task. However there are still open problems that warrant investigation. For example most existing supervised hashing approaches employ a binary label matrix which achieves small margins between wrong labels (0) and true labels (1). This may affect the retrieval performance by generating many false negatives and false positives. In addition some methods adopt a relaxation scheme to solve the binary constraints which may cause large quantization errors. There are also some discrete hashing methods that have been presented but most of them are time-consuming. To conquer these problems we present a label relaxation and discrete matrix factorization method (LRMF) for cross-modal retrieval. It offers a number of innovations. First of all the proposed approach employs a novel label relaxation scheme to control the margins adaptively which has the benefit of reducing the quantization error. Second by virtue of the proposed discrete matrix factorization method designed to learn the binary codes large quantization errors caused by relaxation can be avoided. The experimental results obtained on two widely-used databases demonstrate that LRMF outperforms state-of-the-art cross-media methods.</p>

	<td><p>Due to the storage and retrieval efficiency hashing has been widely deployed to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimedia retrieval. Supervised hashing which improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features followed by another separate quantization step that generates binary codes. However suboptimal hash coding may be produced because the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the binary coding. In this paper we propose a novel Deep Hashing Network (DHN) architecture for supervised hashing in which we jointly learn good image representation tailored to hash coding and formally control the quantization error. The DHN model constitutes four key components (1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture image representations; (2) a fully-connected hashing layer to generate compact binary hash codes; (3) a pairwise cross-entropy loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a pairwise quantization loss for controlling hashing quality. Extensive experiments on standard image retrieval datasets show the proposed DHN model yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Most existing cross-modal hashing methods suffer from the scalability issue in the training phase. In this paper we propose a novel cross-modal hashing approach with a linear time complexity to the training data size to enable scalable indexing for multimedia search across multiple modals. Taking both the intra-similarity in each modal and the inter-similarity across different modals into consideration the proposed approach aims at effectively learning hash functions from large-scale training datasets. More specifically for each modal we first partition the training data into (k) clusters and then represent each training data point with its distances to (k) centroids of the clusters. Interestingly such a k-dimensional data representation can reduce the time complexity of the training phase from traditional O(n2) or higher to O(n) where (n) is the training data size leading to practical learning on large-scale datasets. We further prove that this new representation preserves the intra-similarity in each modal. To preserve the inter-similarity among data points across different modals we transform the derived data representations into a common binary subspace in which binary codes from all the modals are consistent and comparable. The transformation simultaneously outputs the hash functions for all modals which are used to convert unseen data into binary codes. Given a query of one modal it is first mapped into the binary codes using the modals hash functions followed by matching the database binary codes of any other modals. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets confirm the scalability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the state of the art.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is at the heart of large-scale image similarity search and recent methods have been substantially improved through deep learning techniques. Such algorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a subsequent costly binarization step a common solution is to employ loss functions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are grouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that the embedding entries are close to binarized entries e.g. -1 or 1). Still the interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the embeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that decomposes the learning problem in two stages first perform similarity learning over the embedding space with no quantization; second find an optimal orthogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding is close to its sign and then quantize the transformed embedding through the sign function. In the second step we parametrize orthogonal transformations using Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent. Since similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal transformations this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of performance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised fast hyperparameter-free and can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning algorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets and unlike other quantization strategies brings consistent improvements in performance to existing deep hashing algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years hashing methods have been popular in the large-scale media search for low storage and strong representation capabilities. To describe objects with similar overall appearance but subtle differences more and more studies focus on hashing-based fine-grained image retrieval. Existing hashing networks usually generate both local and global features through attention guidance on the same deep activation tensor which limits the diversity of feature representations. To handle this limitation we substitute convolutional descriptors for attention-guided features and propose an Attributes Grouping and Mining Hashing (AGMH) which groups and embeds the category-specific visual attributes in multiple descriptors to generate a comprehensive feature representation for efficient fine-grained image retrieval. Specifically an Attention Dispersion Loss (ADL) is designed to force the descriptors to attend to various local regions and capture diverse subtle details. Moreover we propose a Stepwise Interactive External Attention (SIEA) to mine critical attributes in each descriptor and construct correlations between fine-grained attributes and objects. The attention mechanism is dedicated to learning discrete attributes which will not cost additional computations in hash codes generation. Finally the compact binary codes are learned by preserving pairwise similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that AGMH consistently yields the best performance against state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained benchmark datasets.</p>

	<td><p>An efficient solution to the large-scale recommender system is to represent users and items as binary hash codes in the Hamming space. Towards this end existing methods tend to code users by modeling their Hamming similarities with the items they historically interact with which are termed as the first-order similarities in this work. Despite their efficiency these methods suffer from the suboptimal representative capacity since they forgo the correlation established by connecting multiple first-order similarities i.e. the relation among the indirect instances which could be defined as the high-order similarity. To tackle this drawback we propose to model both the first- and the high-order similarities in the Hamming space through the user-item bipartite graph. Therefore we develop a novel learning to hash framework namely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN) which explicitly models the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing models and obtains performance comparable with the real-valued recommendation models.</p>

The cost of hashing is proportional to data dimensions and thus often the performance bottleneck when dimensionality is high and the number of hash functions involved is large. Surprisingly however little work has been done to improve the efficiency of LSH computation. In this paper we design a simple yet efficient LSH scheme named FastLSH under l2 norm. By combining random sampling and random projection FastLSH reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(m) (m&lt;n) where n is the data dimensionality and m is the number of sampled dimensions. Moreover FastLSH has provable LSH property which distinguishes it from the non-LSH fast sketches. We conduct comprehensive experiments over a collection of real and synthetic datasets for the nearest neighbor search task. Experimental results demonstrate that FastLSH is on par with the state-of-the-arts in terms of answer quality space occupation and query efficiency while enjoying up to 80x speedup in hash function evaluation. We believe that FastLSH is a promising alternative to the classic LSH scheme.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing methods typically aim to preserve the similarity between data points in a feature space by mapping them to binary hash codes. However these methods often overlook the fact that the similarity between data points in the continuous feature space may not be preserved in the discrete hash code space due to the limited similarity range of hash codes. The similarity range is bounded by the code length and can lead to a problem known as similarity collapse. That is the positive and negative pairs of data points become less distinguishable from each other in the hash space. To alleviate this problem in this paper a novel Similarity Distribution Calibration (SDC) method is introduced. SDC aligns the hash code similarity distribution towards a calibration distribution (e.g. beta distribution) with sufficient spread across the entire similarity range thus alleviating the similarity collapse problem. Extensive experiments show that our SDC outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art alternatives on coarse category-level and instance-level image retrieval.

Specifically each input data is encoded into a binary code and a continuous variable or the so-called twin bottlenecks. The similarity graph is then computed from these binary codes which get updated consistently during the training.

	<td><p>Hierarchical semantic structures naturally existing in real-world datasets can assist in capturing the latent distribution of data to learn robust hash codes for retrieval systems. Although hierarchical semantic structures can be simply expressed by integrating semantically relevant data into a high-level taxon with coarser-grained semantics the construction embedding and exploitation of the structures remain tricky for unsupervised hash learning. To tackle these problems we propose a novel unsupervised hashing method named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Hashing (HHCH). We propose to embed continuous hash codes into hyperbolic space for accurate semantic expression since embedding hierarchies in hyperbolic space generates less distortion than in hyper-sphere space and Euclidean space. In addition we extend the K-Means algorithm to hyperbolic space and perform the proposed hierarchical hyperbolic K-Means algorithm to construct hierarchical semantic structures adaptively. To exploit the hierarchical semantic structures in hyperbolic space we designed the hierarchical contrastive learning algorithm including hierarchical instance-wise and hierarchical prototype-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods. Codes will be released.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash pictures a list-wise sorting problem. Its testing metrics e.g. mean-average precision count on a sorted candidate list ordered by pair-wise code similarity. However scarcely does one train a deep hashing model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.</p>

	<td><p>This paper investigates theoretical properties of subsampling and hashing as tools for approximate Euclidean norm-preserving embeddings for vectors with (unknown) additive Gaussian noises. Such embeddings are sometimes called Johnson-lindenstrauss embeddings due to their celebrated lemma. Previous work shows that as sparse embeddings the success of subsampling and hashing closely depends on the (l_infty) to (l_2) ratios of the vector to be mapped. This paper shows that the presence of noise removes such constrain in high-dimensions in other words sparse embeddings such as subsampling and hashing with comparable embedding dimensions to dense embeddings have similar approximate norm-preserving dimensionality-reduction properties. The key is that the noise should be treated as an information to be exploited not simply something to be removed. Theoretical bounds for subsampling and hashing to recover the approximate norm of a high dimension vector in the presence of noise are derived with numerical illustrations showing better performances are achieved in the presence of noise.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely researched to solve the large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search problem owing to its time and storage superiority. In recent years a number of online hashing methods have emerged which can update the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic retrieval. However existing online hashing methods are required to update the whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives which leads to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On the other hand these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the examples especially in the multi-label case. In this paper we propose a novel Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small part of the database. To be specific we first build a query pool in which the nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In addition we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.</p>

We introduce a novel mutual attention module to alleviate the problem of information asymmetry in network features caused by the missing image structure during contrative augmentation. Furthermore we explore the fine-grained semantic relations between images i.e. we divide the images into multiple patches and calculate similarities between patches. The aggregated weighted similarities which reflect the deep image relations are distilled to facilitate the hash codes learning with a distillation loss so as to obtain better retrieval performance.

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied in large-scale data retrieval due to its superior retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. However data are often scattered in data silos with privacy concerns so performing centralized data storage and retrieval is not always possible. Leveraging the concept of federated learning (FL) to perform deep hashing is a recent research trend. However existing frameworks mostly rely on the aggregation of the local deep hashing models which are trained by performing similarity learning with local skewed data only. Therefore they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a real federated environment. To overcome these challenges we propose a novel federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for each class. Globally the transmission of global prototypes with only one prototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost and privacy risk. Locally the use of global prototypes are maximized by jointly training a discriminator network and the local hashing network. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of the deep hashing model in the federated environments with non-IID data distributions.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is a principled approximate nearest neighbor approach to find similar items to a query in a large collection of images. Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stages continuous relaxation and the inference stages discrete quantization is important. However in the existing deep supervised hashing methods coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach substantially improves the performance of several representative hashing~methods.</p>

In this work we propose a jointly learned deep hashing and quantization network (HQ) for cross-modal retrieval. We simultaneously learn binary hash codes and quantization codes to preserve semantic information in multiple modalities by an end-to-end deep learning architecture. At the retrieval step binary hashing is used to retrieve a subset of items from the search space then quantization is used to re-rank the retrieved items. We theoretically and empirically show that this two-stage retrieval approach provides faster retrieval results while preserving accuracy. Experimental results on the NUS-WIDE MIR-Flickr and Amazon datasets demonstrate that HQ achieves boosts of more than 737; in precision compared to supervised neural network-based compact coding models.</p>

Numerous heuristic Hamming space metric learning objectives are designed to obtain high-quality hash codes. Nevertheless a theoretical analysis of criteria for learning good hash codes remains largely unexploited. In this paper we prove that inter-class distinctiveness and intra-class compactness among hash codes determine the lower bound of hash codes performance. Promoting these two characteristics could lift the bound and improve hash learning. We then propose a surrogate model to fully exploit the above objective by estimating the posterior of hash codes and controlling it which results in a low-bias optimization. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. By testing on a series of hash-models we obtain performance improvements among all of them with an up to (26.5) increase in mean Average Precision and an up to (20.5) increase in accuracy.

	<td><p>Case-based Reasoning (CBR) on high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is a trending yet challenging and computationally expensive task in the real world. A promising approach is to obtain low-dimensional hash codes representing cases and perform a similarity retrieval of cases in Hamming space. However previous methods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual construction inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g. high-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data characteristics. To address these issues this work introduces a novel deep hashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient case retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR. Specifically we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous features and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings which effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality and sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then we feed the case embeddings into fully-connected layers and subsequently a hash layer generates hash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss during relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR we further propose an adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that HeCBR greatly reduces storage and significantly accelerates case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance compared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly better than hashing-based CBR methods in classification.</p>

	<td><p>Unsupervised hashing has attracted much attention for binary representation learning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary codes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with similarity preservation between instances. However most existing methods learn hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local geometric structures (i.e. pairwise relationships) of data and lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To address this challenge in this work we propose an effective unsupervised method namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH) for binary representation learning. To be specific firstly we propose a novel personalized hashing module i.e. Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes for different clusters adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to the same Hamming space. In addition we deploy sparse constraints for different personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding over-fitting. Then to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise similarities in our JPSH we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash learning into the seamless formulation. As such JPSH not only distinguishes the instances from different clusters but also preserves local neighborhood structures within the cluster. Finally an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.</p>

However directly tackling the distance or similarity measure between images could also be efficient. To this end we revisit the idea of re-ranking the top-k retrieved images in the context of image retrieval (e.g. the k-reciprocal nearest neighbors) and generalize this idea to transductive few-shot learning. We propose to meta-learn the re-ranking updates such that the similarity graph converges towards the target similarity graph induced by the image labels. Specifically the re-ranking module takes as input an initial similarity graph between the query image and the contextual images using a pre-trained feature extractor and predicts an improved similarity graph by leveraging the structure among the involved images. We show that our re-ranking approach can be applied to unseen images and can further boost existing approaches for both image retrieval and few-shot learning problems. Our approach operates either independently or in conjunction with classical re-ranking approaches yielding clear and consistent improvements on image retrieval (CUB Cars SOP rOxford5K and rParis6K) and transductive few-shot classification (Mini-ImageNet tiered-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS) benchmarks.

	<td><p>Supervised deep learning-based hash and vector quantization are enabling fast and large-scale image retrieval systems. By fully exploiting label annotations they are achieving outstanding retrieval performances compared to the conventional methods. However it is painstaking to assign labels precisely for a vast amount of training data and also the annotation process is error-prone. To tackle these issues we propose the first deep unsupervised image retrieval method dubbed Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ) network which is label-free and trained in a self-supervised manner. We design a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy that jointly learns codewords and deep visual descriptors by comparing individually transformed images (views). Our method analyzes the image contents to extract descriptive features allowing us to understand image representations for accurate retrieval. By conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks we demonstrate that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results even without supervised pretraining.</p>

	<td><p>In hash-based image retrieval systems degraded or transformed inputs usually generate different codes from the original deteriorating the retrieval accuracy. To mitigate this issue data augmentation can be applied during training. However even if augmented samples of an image are similar in real feature space the quantization can scatter them far away in Hamming space. This results in representation discrepancies that can impede training and degrade performance. In this work we propose a novel self-distilled hashing scheme to minimize the discrepancy while exploiting the potential of augmented data. By transferring the hash knowledge of the weakly-transformed samples to the strong ones we make the hash code insensitive to various transformations. We also introduce hash proxy-based similarity learning and binary cross entropy-based quantization loss to provide fine quality hash codes. Ultimately we construct a deep hashing framework that not only improves the existing deep hashing approaches but also achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted and confirm the effectiveness of our work.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing approaches including deep quantization and deep binary hashing have become a common solution to large-scale image retrieval due to their high computation and storage efficiency. Most existing hashing methods cannot produce satisfactory results for fine-grained retrieval because they usually adopt the outputs of the last CNN layer to generate binary codes. Since deeper layers tend to summarize visual clues e.g. texture into abstract semantics e.g. dogs and cats the feature produced by the last CNN layer is less effective in capturing subtle but discriminative visual details that mostly exist in shallow layers. To improve fine-grained image hashing we propose Pyramid Hybrid Pooling Quantization (PHPQ). Specifically we propose a Pyramid Hybrid Pooling (PHP) module to capture and preserve fine-grained semantic information from multi-level features which emphasizes the subtle discrimination of different sub-categories. Besides we propose a learnable quantization module with a partial codebook attention mechanism which helps to optimize the most relevant codewords and improves the quantization. Comprehensive experiments on two widely-used public benchmarks i.e. CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs demonstrate that PHPQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>As hashing becomes an increasingly appealing technique for large-scale image retrieval multi-label hashing is also attracting more attention for the ability to exploit multi-level semantic contents. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method for scalable multi-label image search. Unlike existing approaches with conventional objectives such as contrast and triplet losses we employ a rank list rather than pairs or triplets to provide sufficient global supervision information for all the samples. Specifically a new rank-consistency objective is applied to align the similarity orders from two spaces the original space and the hamming space. A powerful loss function is designed to penalize the samples whose semantic similarity and hamming distance are mismatched in two spaces. Besides a multi-label softmax cross-entropy loss is presented to enhance the discriminative power with a concise formulation of the derivative function. In order to manipulate the neighborhood structure of the samples with different labels we design a multi-label clustering loss to cluster the hashing vectors of the samples with the same labels by reducing the distances between the samples and their multiple corresponding class centers. The state-of-the-art experimental results achieved on three public multi-label datasets MIRFLICKR-25K IAPRTC12 and NUS-WIDE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Semantic hashing represents documents as compact binary vectors (hash codes) and allows both efficient and effective similarity search in large-scale information retrieval. The state of the art has primarily focused on learning hash codes that improve similarity search effectiveness while assuming a brute-force linear scan strategy for searching over all the hash codes even though much faster alternatives exist. One such alternative is multi-index hashing an approach that constructs a smaller candidate set to search over which depending on the distribution of the hash codes can lead to sub-linear search time. In this work we propose Multi-Index Semantic Hashing (MISH) an unsupervised hashing model that learns hash codes that are both effective and highly efficient by being optimized for multi-index hashing. We derive novel training objectives which enable to learn hash codes that reduce the candidate sets produced by multi-index hashing while being end-to-end trainable. In fact our proposed training objectives are model agnostic i.e. not tied to how the hash codes are generated specifically in MISH and are straight-forward to include in existing and future semantic hashing models. We experimentally compare MISH to state-of-the-art semantic hashing baselines in the task of document similarity search. We find that even though multi-index hashing also improves the efficiency of the baselines compared to a linear scan they are still upwards of 3337; slower than MISH while MISH is still able to obtain state-of-the-art effectiveness.</p>

Most existing deep supervised hashing works which are based on pairwise/triplet labels suffer from the expensive computational cost and insufficient utilization of the semantics information. Recently deep classwise hashing introduced a classwise loss supervised by class labels information alternatively; however we find it still has its drawback. In this paper we propose an improved deep classwise hashing which enables hashing learning and class centers learning simultaneously. Specifically we design a two-step strategy on center similarity learning. It interacts with the classwise loss to attract the class center to concentrate on the intra-class samples while pushing other class centers as far as possible. The centers similarity learning contributes to generating more compact and discriminative hashing codes. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets. It shows that the proposed method effectively surpasses the original method and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under various commonly-used evaluation metrics for image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by encoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient retrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning central similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data distribution. For multi-label image retrieval however previous methods only use multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the learning target which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash centers and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the above issue we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach Instance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS) to automatically learn the center weight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly we apply the maximum entropy regularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function and compute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly we update neural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center weights. More importantly the learned center weights can well reflect the proportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks and especially improves the mAP by 1.637;-6.437; on the MS COCO dataset.</p>

	<td><p>Many unsupervised hashing methods are implicitly established on the idea of reconstructing the input data which basically encourages the hashing codes to retain as much information of original data as possible. However this requirement may force the models spending lots of their effort on reconstructing the unuseful background information while ignoring to preserve the discriminative semantic information that is more important for the hashing task. To tackle this problem inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in learning continuous representations we propose to adapt this framework to learn binary hashing codes. Specifically we first propose to modify the objective function to meet the specific requirement of hashing and then introduce a probabilistic binary representation layer into the model to facilitate end-to-end training of the entire model. We further prove the strong connection between the proposed contrastive-learning-based hashing method and the mutual information and show that the proposed model can be considered under the broader framework of the information bottleneck (IB). Under this perspective a more general hashing model is naturally obtained. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its computational and storage efficiency. Recently deep unsupervised hashing methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology. However most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning in which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is confronted with the following defects 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process which cannot explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the aforementioned problems we propose a Deep Self-Adaptive Hashing (DSAH) model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two special designs Adaptive Neighbor Discovery (AND) and Pairwise Information Content (PIC). Firstly we adopt the AND to initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix and then refine this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to them which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance.</p>

	<td><p>Learning from set-structured data is an essential problem with many applications in machine learning and computer vision. This paper focuses on non-parametric and data-independent learning from set-structured data using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) solutions particularly locality-sensitive hashing. We consider the problem of set retrieval from an input set query. Such retrieval problem requires 1) an efficient mechanism to calculate the distances/dissimilarities between sets and 2) an appropriate data structure for fast nearest neighbor search. To that end we propose Sliced-Wasserstein set embedding as a computationally efficient set-2-vector mechanism that enables downstream ANN with theoretical guarantees. The set elements are treated as samples from an unknown underlying distribution and the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is used to compare sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm denoted as Set-LOcality Sensitive Hashing (SLOSH) on various set retrieval datasets and compare our proposed embedding with standard set embedding approaches including Generalized Mean (GeM) embedding/pooling Featurewise Sort Pooling (FSPool) and Covariance Pooling and show consistent improvement in retrieval results.

	<td><p>In content-based image retrieval the first-round retrieval result by simple visual feature comparison may be unsatisfactory which can be refined by visual re-ranking techniques. In image retrieval it is observed that the contextual similarity among the top-ranked images is an important clue to distinguish the semantic relevance. Inspired by this observation in this paper we propose a visual re-ranking method by contextual similarity aggregation with self-attention. In our approach for each image in the top-K ranking list we represent it into an affinity feature vector by comparing it with a set of anchor images. Then the affinity features of the top-K images are refined by aggregating the contextual information with a transformer encoder. Finally the affinity features are used to recalculate the similarity scores between the query and the top-K images for re-ranking of the latter. To further improve the robustness of our re-ranking model and enhance the performance of our method a new data augmentation scheme is designed. Since our re-ranking model is not directly involved with the visual feature used in the initial retrieval it is ready to be applied to retrieval result lists obtained from various retrieval algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed visual re-ranking method.</p>

It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper we propose an Attribute-Aware hashing Network (A(^2)-Net) for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically based on the captured visual representations by attention we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. A(^2)-Net is also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to enhance their representation abilities. Finally the required hash codes are generated by the attribute vectors driven by preserving original similarities. Qualitative experiments on five benchmark fine-grained datasets show our superiority over competing methods. More importantly quantitative results demonstrate the obtained hash codes can strongly correspond to certain kinds of crucial properties of fine-grained objects.</p>

We extend this method to our novel Set-query LSH (SLSH) such that it can find the nearest neighbors of a set of points given as a query. Let ( s(xy) ) be the similarity between two points ( x ) and ( y ). We define a similarity between a set ( Q) and a point ( x ) by aggregating the similarities ( s(px) ) for all ( pin Q ). For example we can take ( s(px) ) to be the angular similarity between ( p ) and ( x ) (i.e. 1-angle (xp)/pi) and aggregate by arithmetic or geometric averaging or taking the lowest similarity. We develop locality sensitive hash families and data structures for a large set of such arithmetic and geometric averaging similarities and analyze their collision probabilities. We also establish an analogous framework and hash families for distance functions. Specifically we give a structure for the euclidean distance aggregated by either averaging or taking the maximum. We leverage SLSH to solve a geometric extension of the approximate near neighbors problem. In this version we consider a metric for which the unit ball is an ellipsoid and its orientation is specified with the query. An important application that motivates our work is group recommendation systems. Such a system embeds movies and users in the same feature space and the task of recommending a movie for a group to watch together translates to a set-query ( Q ) using an appropriate similarity.</p>

Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing attention. However existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are based on batch mode which violates the nature of social images i.e. social images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion. Although there exist many online image hashing methods they either adopt unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags or are designed in the supervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper to overcome the above limitations we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online Hashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes WOH exploits the weak supervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise. Besides We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH which is efficient and scalable.

However most similarity search methods are designed for binary sketches and inefficient for integer sketches. Moreover most methods are either inapplicable or inefficient for dynamic datasets although modern real-world datasets are updated over time. We propose dynamic filter trie (DyFT) a dynamic similarity search method for both binary and integer sketches. An extensive experimental analysis using large real-world datasets shows that DyFT performs superiorly with respect to scalability time performance and memory efficiency.

The use of a fixed set of proxies (weights of the CNN classification layer) is proposed to eliminate this ambiguity and a procedure to design proxy sets that are nearly optimal for both classification and hashing is introduced. The resulting hash-consistent large margin (HCLM) proxies are shown to encourage saturation of hashing units thus guaranteeing a small binarization error while producing highly discriminative hash-codes. A semantic extension (sHCLM) aimed to improve hashing performance in a transfer scenario is also proposed. Extensive experiments show that sHCLM embeddings achieve significant improvements over state-of-the-art hashing procedures on several small and large datasets both within and beyond the set of training classes.</p>

It seeks to preserve fine-grained similarity among data with rich semantics while explicitly require distances between dissimilar points to be larger than a specific value for strong robustness. For this we give an effective bound of this value based on the information coding-theoretic analysis and the above goals are embodied into a margin-adaptive triplet loss.

	<td><p>Due to its effectivity and efficiency deep hashing approaches are widely used for large-scale visual search. However it is still challenging to produce compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple semantics for two main reasons 1) similarity constraints designed in most of the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity assignment(i.e. 0 for instance pairs sharing no label 1 for instance pairs sharing at least 1 label) 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for the semantics of the given dataset which efficiently and precisely guides a feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries a new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity searching and robust hash code generation. Extensive empirical research on four popular benchmarks validates the proposed method and shows it outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

Inspired by this we present Semantic Hashing with Pairwise Reconstruction (PairRec) which is a discrete variational autoencoder based hashing model. PairRec first encodes weakly supervised training pairs (a query document and a semantically similar document) into two hash codes and then learns to reconstruct the same query document from both of these hash codes (i.e. pairwise reconstruction). This pairwise reconstruction enables our model to encode local neighbourhood structures within the hash code directly through the decoder. We experimentally compare PairRec to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches and obtain significant performance improvements in the task of document similarity search.</p>

	<td><p>Image hashing is one of the fundamental problems that demand both efficient and effective solutions for various practical scenarios. Adversarial autoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust locality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash codes. However the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be employed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically they require an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash codes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper we show that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal retrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this challenge we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically by exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional discrete space our method efficiently estimates a better variant of Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional Wasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude better sample complexity thus better generalization property compared to the other adversarial hashing methods. In addition the computational cost is significantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing methods achieving up to 1037; improvement over the current state-of-the-art image hashing methods. The code accompanying this paper is available on Github (https://github.com/khoadoan/adversarial-hashing).</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in large-scale data space by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. However large-scale high-speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash learning field and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10 NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Learning to hash is an efficient paradigm for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search from massive databases. Binary hash codes are typically extracted from an image by rounding output features from a CNN which is trained on a supervised binary similar/ dissimilar task. Drawbacks of this approach are (i) resulting codes do not necessarily capture semantic similarity of the input data (ii) rounding results in information loss manifesting as decreased retrieval performance and (iii) Using only class-wise similarity as a target can lead to trivial solutions simply encoding classifier outputs rather than learning more intricate relations which is not detected by most performance metrics. We overcome (i) via a novel loss function encouraging the relative hash code distances of learned features to match those derived from their targets. We address (ii) via a differentiable estimate of the KL divergence between network outputs and a binary target distribution resulting in minimal information loss when the features are rounded to binary. Finally we resolve (iii) by focusing on a hierarchical precision metric. Efficiency of the methods is demonstrated with semantic image retrieval on the CIFAR-100 ImageNet and Conceptual Captions datasets using similarities inferred from the WordNet label hierarchy or sentence embeddings.</p>

We propose a pairwise loss function with discrete latent VAE to reward within-class similarity and between-class dissimilarity for supervised hashing. Instead of solving the optimization relying on existing biased gradient estimators an unbiased low-variance gradient estimator is adopted to optimize the hashing function by evaluating the non-differentiable loss function over two correlated sets of binary hashing codes to control the variance of gradient estimates.

This component can be combined with convolutional layers to realize a hash algorithm.

The emergence of heterogeneous memory (HM) brings a solution to significantly increase memory capacity and break the above tradeoff Using HM billions of data points can be placed in the main memory on a single machine without using any data compression. However HM consists of both fast (but small) memory and slow (but large) memory and using HM inappropriately slows down query significantly. In this work we present a novel graph-based similarity search algorithm called HM-ANN which takes both memory and data heterogeneity into consideration and enables billion-scale similarity search on a single node without using compression. On two billion-sized datasets BIGANN and DEEP1B HM-ANN outperforms state-of-the-art compression-based solutions such as Lamp;C and IMI+OPQ in recall-vs-latency by a large margin obtaining 4637; higher recall under the same search latency. We also extend existing graph-based methods such as HNSW and NSG with two strong baseline implementations on HM. At billion-point scale HM-ANN is 2X and 5.8X faster than our HNSWand NSG baselines respectively to reach the same accuracy.</p>

However FlyHash uses random projections and cannot learn from data. Building on inspiration from FlyHash and the ubiquity of sparse expansive representations in neurobiology our work proposes a novel hashing algorithm BioHash that produces sparse high dimensional hash codes in a data-driven manner.

Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k Nus-wide Cifar-10 Mscoco Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

	<td><p>Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed hashing has been widely used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data points within a given Hamming radius to each query which can enable search at a constant or sub-linear time cost. However existing hashing methods cannot achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex scenarios since they learn only one hash code for each image. More specifically by using one hash code to represent one image existing methods might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a result a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving similar images based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper we propose a novel hashing framework called multiple code hashing (MCH) to improve the performance of hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for each image with each code representing a different region of the image. Furthermore we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash bucket search compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for each image.</p>

Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity-preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre-trained model as the guiding information i.e. treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre-trained model many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover few of the methods consider the robustness of models which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper we propose a new method named textbfComprehensive stextbfImilarity textbfMining and ctextbfOnsistency leartextbfNing (CIMON).

Second both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb-invariant and discriminative hash codes.

	<td><p>Due to the compelling efficiency in retrieval and storage similarity-preserving hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval. However existing methods have poor performance in retrieval using an extremely short-length hash code due to weak ability of classification and poor distribution of hash bit. To address this issue in this study we propose a novel reinforcing short-length hashing (RSLH). In this proposed RSLH mutual reconstruction between the hash representation and semantic labels is performed to preserve the semantic information. Furthermore to enhance the accuracy of hash representation a pairwise similarity matrix is designed to make a balance between accuracy and training expenditure on memory. In addition a parameter boosting strategy is integrated to reinforce the precision with hash bits fusion. Extensive experiments on three large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of RSLH under various short-length hashing scenarios.</p>

	<td><p>Online hashing methods are efficient in learning the hash functions from the streaming data. However when the hash functions change the binary codes for the database have to be recomputed to guarantee the retrieval accuracy. Recomputing the binary codes by accumulating the whole database brings a timeliness challenge to the online retrieval process. In this paper we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space. The queries and the binary code database are projected asymmetrically to further improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on two multi-label image databases demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method for multi-label image retrieval.</p>

In recent years various hashing methods based on deep neural networks have been proposed and achieved higher precision than the other hashing methods. In these methods multiple losses for hash codes and the parameters of neural networks are defined. They generate hash codes that minimize the weighted sum of the losses. Therefore an expert has to tune the weights for the losses heuristically and the probabilistic optimality of the loss function cannot be explained. In order to generate explainable hash codes without weight tuning we theoretically derive a single loss function with no hyperparameters for the hash code from the probability distribution of the images. By generating hash codes that minimize this loss function highly accurate image retrieval with probabilistic optimality is performed. We evaluate the performance of hashing using MNIST CIFAR-10 SVHN and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recently randomly mapping vectorial data to strings of discrete symbols (i.e. sketches) for fast and space-efficient similarity searches has become popular. Such random mapping is called similarity-preserving hashing and approximates a similarity metric by using the Hamming distance. Although many efficient similarity searches have been proposed most of them are designed for binary sketches. Similarity searches on integer sketches are in their infancy. In this paper we present a novel space-efficient trie named (b)-bit sketch trie on integer sketches for scalable similarity searches by leveraging the idea behind succinct data structures (i.e. space-efficient data structures while supporting various data operations in the compressed format) and a favorable property of integer sketches as fixed-length strings. Our experimental results obtained using real-world datasets show that a trie-based index is built from integer sketches and efficiently performs similarity searches on the index by pruning useless portions of the search space which greatly improves the search time and space-efficiency of the similarity search. The experimental results show that our similarity search is at most one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art similarity searches. Besides our method needs only 10 GiB of memory on a billion-scale database while state-of-the-art similarity searches need 29 GiB of memory.</p>

	<td><p>Feature hashing and other random projection schemes are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. The goal is to efficiently project a high-dimensional feature vector living in R^n into a much lower-dimensional space R^m while approximately preserving Euclidean norm. These schemes can be constructed using sparse random projections for example using a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform. A line of work introduced by Weinberger et. al (ICML 09) analyzes the accuracy of sparse JL with sparsity 1 on feature vectors with small linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio. Recently Freksen Kamma and Larsen (NeurIPS 18) closed this line of work by proving a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for sparse JL with sparsity 1. In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of using sparsity s greater than 1 in sparse JL on feature vectors. Our main result is a tight tradeoff between linfinity-to-l2 norm ratio and accuracy for a general sparsity s that significantly generalizes the result of Freksen et. al. Our result theoretically demonstrates that sparse JL with s 1 can have significantly better norm-preservation properties on feature vectors than sparse JL with s = 1; we also empirically demonstrate this finding.</p>

To this end we propose a novel two-pyramid hashing architecture to learn both the semantic information and the subtle appearance details for fine-grained image search. Inspired by the feature pyramids of convolutional neural network a vertical pyramid is proposed to capture the high-layer features and a horizontal pyramid combines multiple low-layer features with structural information to capture the subtle differences. To fuse the low-level features a novel combination strategy called consensus fusion is proposed to capture all subtle information from several low-layers for finer retrieval.

The pairwise and triplet losses are two widely used similarity preserving manners for deep hashing. These manners ignore the fact that hashing is a prediction task on the list of binary codes. However learning deep hashing with listwise supervision is challenging in 1) how to obtain the rank list of whole training set when the batch size of the deep network is always small and 2) how to utilize the listwise supervision. In this paper we present a novel deep policy hashing architecture with two systems are learned in parallel a query network and a shared and slowly changing database network. The following three steps are repeated until convergence 1) the database network encodes all training samples into binary codes to obtain a whole rank list 2) the query network is trained based on policy learning to maximize a reward that indicates the performance of the whole ranking list of binary codes e.g. mean average precision (MAP) and 3) the database network is updated as the query network.

We principally formulate the computation of the proposed central similarity metric by introducing a new concept i.e. emphhash center that refers to a set of data points scattered in the Hamming space with a sufficient mutual distance between each other. We then provide an efficient method to construct well separated hash centers by leveraging the Hadamard matrix and Bernoulli distributions. Finally we propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. CSQ is generic and applicable to both image and video hashing scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale image and video retrieval tasks demonstrate that CSQ can generate cohesive hash codes for similar data pairs and dispersed hash codes for dissimilar pairs achieving a noticeable boost in retrieval performance i.e. 337;-2037; in mAP over the previous state-of-the-arts.

Most online hashing methods learning binary codes based on pairwise similarities of training instances fail to capture the semantic relationship and suffer from a poor generalization in large-scale applications due to large variations. In this paper we propose to model the similarity distributions between the input data and the hashing codes upon which a novel supervised online hashing method dubbed as Similarity Distribution based Online Hashing (SDOH) is proposed to keep the intrinsic semantic relationship in the produced Hamming space. Specifically we first transform the discrete similarity matrix into a probability matrix via a Gaussian-based normalization to address the extremely imbalanced distribution issue. And then we introduce a scaling Student t-distribution to solve the challenging initialization problem and efficiently bridge the gap between the known and unknown distributions. Lastly we align the two distributions via minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-diverence) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by which an intuitive similarity constraint is imposed to update hashing model on the new streaming data with a powerful generalizing ability to the past data. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed SDOH over the state-of-the-art methods in the online retrieval task.</p>

In combination with a hash algorithm that maps those weighted sets to compact signatures which allow fast estimation of pairwise similarities it constitutes a valuable method for big data applications such as near-duplicate detection nearest neighbor search or clustering. This paper introduces a class of one-pass locality-sensitive hash algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster than the original approach. The performance gain is achieved by calculating signature components not independently but collectively. Four different algorithms are proposed based on this idea. Two of them are statistically equivalent to the original approach and can be used as drop-in replacements. The other two may even improve the estimation error by introducing statistical dependence between signature components. Moreover the presented techniques can be specialized for the conventional Jaccard similarity resulting in highly efficient algorithms that outperform traditional minwise hashing and that are able to compete with the state of the art.</p>

	<td><p>Recently kernelized locality sensitive hashcodes have been successfully employed as representations of natural language text especially showing high relevance to biomedical relation extraction tasks. In this paper we propose to optimize the hashcode representations in a nearly unsupervised manner in which we only use data points but not their class labels for learning. The optimized hashcode representations are then fed to a supervised classifier following the prior work. This nearly unsupervised approach allows fine-grained optimization of each hash function which is particularly suitable for building hashcode representations generalizing from a training set to a test set. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach for biomedical relation extraction tasks obtaining significant accuracy improvements w.r.t. state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised approaches.</p>

However existing hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval cannot fully capture the heterogeneous multi-modal correlation and exploit the semantic information. In this paper we propose a novel emphFusion-supervised Deep Cross-modal Hashing (FDCH) approach. Firstly FDCH learns unified binary codes through a fusion hash network with paired samples as input which effectively enhances the modeling of the correlation of heterogeneous multi-modal data. Then these high-quality unified hash codes further supervise the training of the modality-specific hash networks for encoding out-of-sample queries. Meanwhile both pair-wise similarity information and classification information are embedded in the hash networks under one stream framework which simultaneously preserves cross-modal similarity and keeps semantic consistency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of FDCH.</p>

	<td><p>Representing images by compact hash codes is an attractive approach for large-scale content-based image retrieval. In most state-of-the-art hashing-based image retrieval systems for each image local descriptors are first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous works the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. Hence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors. Furthermore we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.</p>

Particularly cross-modal retrieval that searches across different modalities becomes an active but challenging problem. Although dozens of cross-modal hashing algorithms are proposed to yield compact binary codes the exhaustive search is impractical for the real-time purpose and Hamming distance computation suffers inaccurate results. In this paper we propose a novel search method that utilizes a probability-based index scheme over binary hash codes in cross-modal retrieval. The proposed hash code indexing scheme exploits a few binary bits of the hash code as the index code. We construct an inverted index table based on index codes and train a neural network to improve the indexing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets for retrieval across image and text modalities where hash codes are generated by three cross-modal hashing methods. Results show the proposed method effectively boost the performance on these hash methods.</p>

	<td><p>Large-scale cross-modal hashing similarity retrieval has attracted more and more attention in modern search applications such as search engines and autopilot showing great superiority in computation and storage. However current unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods still have some limitations (1)many methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization objective which may significantly degrade the retrieval performance;(2)most existing hashing model project heterogenous data into a common latent space which may always lose sight of diversity in heterogenous data;(3)transforming real-valued data point to binary codes always results in abundant loss of information producing the suboptimal continuous latent space. To overcome above problems in this paper a novel Cluster-wise Unsupervised Hashing (CUH) method is proposed. Specifically CUH jointly performs the multi-view clustering that projects the original data points from different modalities into its own low-dimensional latent semantic space and finds the cluster centroid points and the common clustering indicators in its own low-dimensional space and learns the compact hash codes and the corresponding linear hash functions. An discrete optimization framework is developed to learn the unified binary codes across modalities under the guidance cluster-wise code-prototypes. The reasonableness and effectiveness of CUH is well demonstrated by comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets.</p>

In particularcross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in multimedia similarity search applications. However almost all existing methods employing cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their ignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains richer semantic information leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for cross-modal retrieval. First we utilize the triplet labels which describes the relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to capture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We then establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal view to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally graph regularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the original semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on two popular cross-modal datasets.</p>

Most cross-modal hashing methods follow the traditional supervised hashing framework in which the (O(n^2)) data pairs and (O(n^3)) data triplets are generated for training but the training procedure is less efficient because the complexity is high for large-scale dataset. To address these issues we propose a novel and efficient cross-modal hashing algorithm in which the unary loss is introduced. First of all We introduce the Cross-Modal Unary Loss (CMUL) with (O(n)) complexity to bridge the traditional triplet loss and classification-based unary loss. A more accurate bound of the triplet loss for structured multilabel data is also proposed in CMUL. Second we propose the novel Joint Cluster Cross-Modal Hashing (JCCH) algorithm for efficient hash learning in which the CMUL is involved. The resultant hashcodes form several clusters in which the hashcodes in the same cluster share similar semantic information and the heterogeneity gap on different modalities is diminished by sharing the clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to be applied to various types of data and experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior over or comparable with state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods and training with the proposed method is more efficient than others.</p>

Particularly supervised hashing has recently received considerable research attention by leveraging the label information to preserve the pairwise similarities of data points in the Hamming space. However there still remain two crucial bottlenecks 1) the learning process of the full pairwise similarity preservation is computationally unaffordable and unscalable to deal with big data; 2) the available category information of data are not well-explored to learn discriminative hash functions. To overcome these challenges we propose a unified Semantic-Aware DIscrete Hashing (SADIH) framework which aims to directly embed the transformed semantic information into the asymmetric similarity approximation and discriminative hashing function learning. Specifically a semantic-aware latent embedding is introduced to asymmetrically preserve the full pairwise similarities while skillfully handle the cumbersome n times n pairwise similarity matrix. Meanwhile a semantic-aware autoencoder is developed to jointly preserve the data structures in the discriminative latent semantic space and perform data reconstruction. Moreover an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that our SADIH can clearly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the additional benefit of lower computational costs.</p>

Most supervised deep hashing methods have similar loss designs with embedding learning while quantizing the continuous high-dim feature into compact binary space. We argue that the existing deep hashing schemes are defective in two issues that seriously affect the performance i.e. bit independence and bit balance. The former refers to hash codes of different classes should be independent of each other while the latter means each bit should have a balanced distribution of +1s and -1s. In this paper we propose a novel supervised deep hashing method termed Hadamard Codebook based Deep Hashing (HCDH) which solves the above two problems in a unified formulation. Specifically we utilize an off-the-shelf algorithm to generate a binary Hadamard codebook to satisfy the requirement of bit independence and bit balance which subsequently serves as the desired outputs of the hash functions learning. We also introduce a projection matrix to solve the inconsistency between the order of Hadamard matrix and the number of classes. Besides the proposed HCDH further exploits the supervised labels by constructing a classifier on top of the outputs of hash functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCDH can yield discriminative and balanced binary codes which well outperforms many state-of-the-arts on three widely-used benchmarks.</p>

	<td><p>Computing approximate nearest neighbors in high dimensional spaces is a central problem in large-scale data mining with a wide range of applications in machine learning and data science. A popular and effective technique in computing nearest neighbors approximately is the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme. In this paper we aim to develop LSH schemes for distance functions that measure the distance between two probability distributions particularly for f-divergences as well as a generalization to capture mutual information loss. First we provide a general framework to design LHS schemes for f-divergence distance functions and develop LSH schemes for the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence and triangular discrimination in this framework. We show a two-sided approximation result for approximation of the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence by the Hellinger distance which may be of independent interest. Next we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search. We exemplify this method by applying it to the mutual information loss due to its several important applications such as model compression.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely studied for big data retrieval due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) aims to learn a hashing model that is trained using only samples from seen categories but can generalize well to samples of unseen categories. ZSH generally uses category attributes to seek a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen categories to unseen ones. As a result it may perform poorly when labeled data are insufficient. ZSH methods are mainly designed for single-modality data which prevents their application to the widely spread multi-modal data. On the other hand existing cross-modal hashing solutions assume that all the modalities share the same category labels while in practice the labels of different data modalities may be different. To address these issues we propose a general Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing (CZHash) solution to effectively leverage unlabeled and labeled multi-modality data with different label spaces. CZHash first quantifies the composite similarity between instances using label and feature information. It then defines an objective function to achieve deep feature learning compatible with the composite similarity preserving category attribute space learning and hashing coding function learning. CZHash further introduces an alternative optimization procedure to jointly optimize these learning objectives. Experiments on benchmark multi-modal datasets show that CZHash significantly outperforms related representative hashing approaches both on effectiveness and adaptability.</p>

Given semantic annotations such as class labels and pairwise similarities of the training data hashing methods can learn and generate effective and compact binary codes. While some newly introduced images may contain undefined semantic labels which we call unseen images zeor-shot hashing techniques have been studied. However existing zeor-shot hashing methods focus on the retrieval of single-label images and cannot handle multi-label images. In this paper for the first time a novel transductive zero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In order to predict the labels of the unseen/target data a visual-semantic bridge is built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data. Then pairwise similarity loss and focal quantization loss are constructed for training a hashing model using both the seen/source and unseen/target data. Extensive evaluations on three popular multi-label datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significantly better results than the competing methods.</p>

However the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem in this paper we propose a novel hashing approach dubbed as emphDiscrete Semantic Transfer Hashing (DSTH). The key idea is to emphdirectly augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss we explicitly impose the discrete constraint bit–uncorrelation constraint and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Supervised cross-modal hashing has gained increasing research interest on large-scale retrieval task owning to its satisfactory performance and efficiency. However it still has some challenging issues to be further studied 1) most of them fail to well preserve the semantic correlations in hash codes because of the large heterogenous gap; 2) most of them relax the discrete constraint on hash codes leading to large quantization error and consequent low performance; 3) most of them suffer from relatively high memory cost and computational complexity during training procedure which makes them unscalable. In this paper to address above issues we propose a supervised cross-modal hashing method based on matrix factorization dubbed Efficient Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically collective matrix factorization on heterogenous features and semantic embedding with class labels are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore the feature based similarities and semantic correlations can be both preserved in hash codes which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative. Then an efficient discrete optimal algorithm is proposed to handle the scalable issue. Instead of learning hash codes bit-by-bit hash codes matrix can be obtained directly which is more efficient. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that EDSH produces a superior performance in both accuracy and scalability over some existing cross-modal hashing methods.</p>

In this work we propose a different approach where we leverage graph convolutional networks to directly encode neighbor information into image descriptors. We further leverage ideas from clustering and manifold learning and introduce an unsupervised loss based on pairwise separation of image similarities. Empirically we demonstrate that our model is able to successfully learn a new descriptor space that significantly improves retrieval accuracy while still allowing efficient inner product inference.

	<td><p>Hashing methods have been recently found very effective in retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images due to their computational efficiency and fast search speed. The traditional hashing methods in RS usually exploit hand-crafted features to learn hash functions to obtain binary codes which can be insufficient to optimally represent the information content of RS images. To overcome this problem in this paper we introduce a metric-learning based hashing network which learns 1) a semantic-based metric space for effective feature representation; and 2) compact binary hash codes for fast archive search. Our network considers an interplay of multiple loss functions that allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when binarized. Experiments carried out on two benchmark RS archives point out that the proposed network significantly improves the retrieval performance under the same retrieval time when compared to the state-of-the-art hashing methods in RS.</p>

	<td><p>In large scale systems approximate nearest neighbour search is a crucial algorithm to enable efficient data retrievals. Recently deep learning-based hashing algorithms have been proposed as a promising paradigm to enable data dependent schemes. Often their efficacy is only demonstrated on data sets with fixed limited numbers of classes. In practical scenarios those labels are not always available or one requires a method that can handle a higher input variability as well as a higher granularity. To fulfil those requirements we look at more flexible similarity measures. In this work we present a novel flexible end-to-end trainable network for large-scale data hashing. Our method works by transforming the data distribution to behave as a uniform distribution on a product of spheres. The transformed data is subsequently hashed to a binary form in a way that maximises entropy of the output (i.e. to fully utilise the available bit-rate capacity) while maintaining the correctness (i.e. close items hash to the same key in the map). We show that the method outperforms baseline approaches such as locality-sensitive hashing and product quantisation in the limited capacity regime.</p>

The proposed approach consists of a region localization module and a hash coding module. The region localization module aims to provide informative regions to the hash coding module. The hash coding module aims to generate effective binary codes and give feedback for learning better localizer. Moreover to better capture subtle differences multi-scale regions at different layers are learned without the need of bounding-box/part annotations.

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale data retrieval in many domains due to its low storage cost and high retrieval speed. Existing cross-modal hashing methods optimistically assume that the correspondence between training samples across modalities are readily available. This assumption is unrealistic in practical applications. In addition these methods generally require the same number of samples across different modalities which restricts their flexibility. We propose a flexible cross-modal hashing approach (Flex-CMH) to learn effective hashing codes from weakly-paired data whose correspondence across modalities are partially (or even totally) unknown. FlexCMH first introduces a clustering-based matching strategy to explore the local structure of each cluster and thus to find the potential correspondence between clusters (and samples therein) across modalities. To reduce the impact of an incomplete correspondence it jointly optimizes in a unified objective function the potential correspondence the cross-modal hashing functions derived from the correspondence and a hashing quantitative loss. An alternative optimization technique is also proposed to coordinate the correspondence and hash functions and to reinforce the reciprocal effects of the two objectives. Experiments on publicly multi-modal datasets show that FlexCMH achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods and it indeed offers a high degree of flexibility for practical cross-modal hashing tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Hash based nearest neighbor search has become attractive in many applications. However the quantization in hashing usually degenerates the discriminative power when using Hamming distance ranking. Besides for large-scale visual search existing hashing methods cannot directly support the efficient search over the data with multiple sources and while the literature has shown that adaptively incorporating complementary information from diverse sources or views can significantly boost the search performance. To address the problems this paper proposes a novel and generic approach to building multiple hash tables with multiple views and generating fine-grained ranking results at bitwise and tablewise levels. For each hash table a query-adaptive bitwise weighting is introduced to alleviate the quantization loss by simultaneously exploiting the quality of hash functions and their complement for nearest neighbor search. From the tablewise aspect multiple hash tables are built for different data views as a joint index over which a query-specific rank fusion is proposed to rerank all results from the bitwise ranking by diffusing in a graph. Comprehensive experiments on image search over three well-known benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves up to 17.1137; and 20.2837; performance gains on single and multiple table search over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Image similarity measures play an important role in nearest neighbor search and duplicate detection for large-scale image datasets. Recently Minwise Hashing (or Minhash) and its related hashing algorithms have achieved great performances in large-scale image retrieval systems. However there are a large number of comparisons for image pairs in these applications which may spend a lot of computation time and affect the performance. In order to quickly obtain the pairwise images that theirs similarities are higher than the specific threshold T (e.g. 0.5) we propose a dynamic threshold filter of Minwise Hashing for image similarity measures. It greatly reduces the calculation time by terminating the unnecessary comparisons in advance. We also find that the filter can be extended to other hashing algorithms on when the estimator satisfies the binomial distribution such as b-Bit Minwise Hashing One Permutation Hashing etc. In this pager we use the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model based on the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to represent the image features. We have proved that the filter is correct and effective through the experiment on real image datasets.</p>

	<td><p>In social networks heterogeneous multimedia data correlate to each other such as videos and their corresponding tags in YouTube and image-text pairs in Facebook. Nearest neighbor retrieval across multiple modalities on large data sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an efficient solution since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise XOR operations can be fast handled the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing code length becomes longer the retrieval performance improvement becomes slower. In this paper we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR) for multimodal hashing. First the sigmoid function is used to embed the data matrices. Then the MCR is applied on the output of sigmoid function. As the output of sigmoid function approximates a binary code matrix the proposed MCR can efficiently decorrelate the hashing codes. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed method becomes greater as the code length increases.</p>

	<td><p>Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain useful information although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario we formulate the problem of semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly we name our model Weakly Supervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly supervised image hashing.</p>

	<td><p>Learning compact binary codes for image retrieval task using deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention recently. However training deep hashing networks for the task is challenging due to the binary constraints on the hash codes the similarity preserving property and the requirement for a vast amount of labelled images. To the best of our knowledge none of the existing methods has tackled all of these challenges completely in a unified framework. In this work we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for the task in which the network is trained to produce binary codes directly from image pixels without the need of manual annotation. In particular to deal with the non-smoothness of binary constraints we propose a novel pairwise constrained loss function which simultaneously encodes the distances between pairs of hash codes and the binary quantization error. In order to train the network with the proposed loss function we propose an efficient parameter learning algorithm. In addition to provide similar / dissimilar training images to train the network we exploit 3D models reconstructed from unlabelled images for automatic generation of enormous training image pairs. The extensive experiments on image retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art compact representation methods on the image retrieval problem.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance which has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. With the rapid development of deep learning deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data but the training is difficult and less efficient because (O(n^2)) data pairs and (O(n^3)) triplets are involved. To address these issues we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. We first of all introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss thus reducing the complexity to (O(n)) and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss named Semantic Cluster Unary Loss (SCUL). The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters which means hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to be extended to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing techniques are in great demand for a wide range of real-world applications such as image retrieval and network compression. Nevertheless existing approaches could hardly guarantee a satisfactory performance with the extremely low-bit (e.g. 4-bit) hash codes due to the severe information loss and the shrink of the discrete solution space. In this paper we propose a novel textitCollaborative Learning strategy that is tailored for generating high-quality low-bit hash codes. The core idea is to jointly distill bit-specific and informative representations for a group of pre-defined code lengths. The learning of short hash codes among the group can benefit from the manifold shared with other long codes where multiple views from different hash codes provide the supplementary guidance and regularization making the convergence faster and more stable. To achieve that an asymmetric hashing framework with two variants of multi-head embedding structures is derived termed as Multi-head Asymmetric Hashing (MAH) leading to great efficiency of training and querying. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed MAH and have shown that the 8-bit hash codes generated by MAH achieve (94.3) of the MAP (Mean Average Precision (MAP)) score on the CIFAR-10 dataset which significantly surpasses the performance of the 48-bit codes by the state-of-the-arts in image retrieval tasks.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel asymmetric supervised deep hashing method to preserve the semantic structure among different categories and generate the binary codes simultaneously. Specifically two asymmetric deep networks are constructed to reveal the similarity between each pair of images according to their semantic labels. The deep hash functions are then learned through two networks by minimizing the gap between the learned features and discrete codes. Furthermore since the binary codes in the Hamming space also should keep the semantic affinity existing in the original space another asymmetric pairwise loss is introduced to capture the similarity between the binary codes and real-value features. This asymmetric loss not only improves the retrieval performance but also contributes to a quick convergence at the training phase. By taking advantage of the two-stream deep structures and two types of asymmetric pairwise functions an alternating algorithm is designed to optimize the deep features and high-quality binary codes efficiently. Experimental results on three real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach as compared with state-of-the-art.</p>

Subject to the distribution skewness underlying the similarity information most existing deep hashing methods may underperform for imbalanced data due to misspecified loss functions. This paper presents Deep Priority Hashing (DPH) an end-to-end architecture that generates compact and balanced hash codes in a Bayesian learning framework. The main idea is to reshape the standard cross-entropy loss for similarity-preserving learning such that it down-weighs the loss associated to highly-confident pairs. This idea leads to a novel priority cross-entropy loss which prioritizes the training on uncertain pairs over confident pairs. Also we propose another priority quantization loss which prioritizes hard-to-quantize examples for generation of nearly lossless hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPH can generate high-quality hash codes and yield state-of-the-art image retrieval results on three datasets ImageNet NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO.</p>

	<td><p>Deep supervised hashing has emerged as an influential solution to large-scale semantic image retrieval problems in computer vision. In the light of recent progress convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning. However complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by similar/dissimilar labels which limits the retrieval performance. Generally pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard we propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code. Specifically a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian distribution is proposed which preserves semantic variations while penalizes the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes a two-step optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Moreover when training samples are limited our method surpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins.</p>

	<td><p>Hash coding has been widely used in the approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Recently many deep hashing methods have been proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise similarity on the semantic-level labels where the pairwise similarity is generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is the pairwise similarity is 1 if they share no less than one class label and 0 if they do not share any. However such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper a new deep hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the pairwise similarity into an instance similarity where the instance similarity is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based on the instance similarity a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction and are efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Feature hashing also known as em the hashing trick introduced by Weinberger et al. (2009) is one of the key techniques used in scaling-up machine learning algorithms. Loosely speaking feature hashing uses a random sparse projection matrix (A ^n to ^m) (where (m ll n)) in order to reduce the dimension of the data from (n) to (m) while approximately preserving the Euclidean norm. Every column of (A) contains exactly one non-zero entry equals to either (-1) or (1). Weinberger et al. showed tail bounds on (Ax_2^2). Specifically they showed that for every (varepsilon delta) if (x_infty / x_2) is sufficiently small and (m) is sufficiently large then beginequationPr ; ;Ax_2^2 - x_2^2; &lt; varepsilon x_2^2 ; ge 1 - delta ;.endequation These bounds were later extended by Dasgupta et al. (2010) and most recently refined by Dahlgaard et al. (2017) however the true nature of the performance of this key technique and specifically the correct tradeoff between the pivotal parameters (x_infty / x_2 m varepsilon delta) remained an open question. We settle this question by giving tight asymptotic bounds on the exact tradeoff between the central parameters thus providing a complete understanding of the performance of feature hashing. We complement the asymptotic bound with empirical data which shows that the constants hiding in the asymptotic notation are in fact very close to (1) thus further illustrating the tightness of the presented bounds in practice.</p>

To obtain better precision most studies focus on designing different objective functions with different constraints or penalty terms that consider neighborhood information. In this paper in contrast to existing hashing methods we propose a novel generalized framework called fusion hashing (FH) to improve the precision of existing hashing methods without adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed FH given an existing hashing method we first execute it several times to get several different hash codes for a set of training samples. We then propose two novel fusion strategies that combine these different hash codes into one set of final hash codes. Based on the final hash codes we learn a simple linear hash function for the samples that can significantly improve model precision. In general the proposed FH can be adopted in existing hashing method and achieve more precise and stable performance compared to the original hashing method with little extra expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments were performed based on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework</p>

However the representation capacity of a single view is insufficient and some discriminative information is not captured which results in limited improvement. In this paper we employ multiple views to represent images and texts for enriching the feature information. Our framework exploits the complementary information among multiple views to better learn the discriminative compact hash codes. A discrete hashing learning framework that jointly performs classifier learning and subspace learning is proposed to complete multiple search tasks simultaneously. Our framework includes two stages namely a kernelization process and a quantization process. Kernelization aims to find a common subspace where multi-view features can be fused. The quantization stage is designed to learn discriminative unified hashing codes. Extensive experiments are performed on single-label datasets (WiKi and MMED) and multi-label datasets (MIRFlickr and NUS-WIDE) and the experimental results indicate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this work we adopt the greedy principle to tackle this NP hard problem by iteratively updating the network toward the probable optimal discrete solution in each iteration. A hash coding layer is designed to implement our approach which strictly uses the sign function in forward propagation to maintain the discrete constraints while in back propagation the gradients are transmitted intactly to the front layer to avoid the vanishing gradients.

	<td><p>Hashing has attracted increasing research attentions in recent years due to its high efficiency of computation and storage in image retrieval. Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and hash functions learning with deep neural networks. However most existing deep hashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global semantic information while ignoring the local spatial information of images. The loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash functions therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity retrieval. In this work we propose a novel Deep Ordinal Hashing (DOH) method which learns ordinal representations by leveraging the ranking structure of feature space from both local and global views. In particular to effectively build the ranking structure we propose to learn the rank correlation space by exploiting the local spatial information from Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and the global semantic information from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) simultaneously. More specifically an effective spatial attention model is designed to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning well-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing frameworkthe local spatial and global semantic nature of images are captured in an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner. Experimental results conducted on three widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed DOH method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

Providing training and test data subjected to a fixed set of pre-defined categories the cutting-edge SBIR and cross-modal hashing works obtain acceptable retrieval performance. However most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero-shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch-image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution respectively. As an important part of ZSIH we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge ZSIH is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets i.e. Sketchy and TU-Berlin with a novel zero-shot train-test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works.</p>

This paper proposes Approximately Binary Clamping (ABC) which is non-saturating end-to-end trainable with fast convergence and can output true binary visual representations.

	<td><p>With the advantage of low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency hashing techniques have recently been an emerging topic in cross-modal similarity search. As multiple modal data reflect similar semantic content many researches aim at learning unified binary codes. However discriminative hashing features learned by these methods are not adequate. This results in lower accuracy and robustness. We propose a novel hashing learning framework which jointly performs classifier learning subspace learning and matrix factorization to preserve class-specific semantic content termed Discriminative Supervised Hashing (DSH) to learn the discrimative unified binary codes for multi-modal data. Besides reducing the loss of information and preserving the non-linear structure of data DSH non-linearly projects different modalities into the common space in which the similarity among heterogeneous data points can be measured. Extensive experiments conducted on the three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper outperforms several state-of -the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>In recent years deep hashing methods have been proved to be efficient since it employs convolutional neural network to learn features and hashing codes simultaneously. However these methods are mostly supervised. In real-world application it is a time-consuming and overloaded task for annotating a large number of images. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing method for large-scale image retrieval. Our method namely unsupervised semantic deep hashing (textbfUSDH) uses semantic information preserved in the CNN feature layer to guide the training of network. We enforce four criteria on hashing codes learning based on VGG-19 model 1) preserving relevant information of feature space in hashing space; 2) minimizing quantization loss between binary-like codes and hashing codes; 3) improving the usage of each bit in hashing codes by using maximum information entropy and 4) invariant to image rotation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 NUSWIDE have demonstrated that textbfUSDH outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval. We also conduct experiments on Oxford 17 datasets for fine-grained classification to verify its efficiency for other computer vision tasks.</p>

	<td><p>Zero-shot Hashing (ZSH) is to learn hashing models for novel/target classes without training data which is an important and challenging problem. Most existing ZSH approaches exploit transfer learning via an intermediate shared semantic representations between the seen/source classes and novel/target classes. However due to having disjoint the hash functions learned from the source dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. In this paper we study the transductive ZSH i.e. we have unlabeled data for novel classes. We put forward a simple yet efficient joint learning approach via coarse-to-fine similarity mining which transfers knowledges from source data to target data. It mainly consists of two building blocks in the proposed deep architecture 1) a shared two-streams network which the first stream operates on the source data and the second stream operates on the unlabeled data to learn the effective common image representations and 2) a coarse-to-fine module which begins with finding the most representative images from target classes and then further detect similarities among these images to transfer the similarities of the source data to the target data in a greedy fashion. Extensive evaluation results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Retrieving nearest neighbors across correlated data in multiple modalities such as image-text pairs on Facebook and video-tag pairs on YouTube has become a challenging task due to the huge amount of data. Multimodal hashing methods that embed data into binary codes can boost the retrieving speed and reduce storage requirement. As unsupervised multimodal hashing methods are usually inferior to supervised ones while the supervised ones requires too much manually labeled data the proposed method in this paper utilizes a part of labels to design a semi-supervised multimodal hashing method. It first computes the transformation matrices for data matrices and label matrix. Then with these transformation matrices fuzzy logic is introduced to estimate a label matrix for unlabeled data. Finally it uses the estimated label matrix to learn hashing functions for data in each modality to generate a unified binary code matrix. Experiments show that the proposed semi-supervised method with 5037; labels can get a medium performance among the compared supervised ones and achieve an approximate performance to the best supervised method with 9037; labels. With only 1037; labels the proposed method can still compete with the worst compared supervised one.</p>

In this paper we consider the fundamental problem of finding a nearest set from a collection of sets to a query set. This problem has obvious applications in large-scale visual retrieval and recognition and also in applied fields beyond computer vision. One challenge stands out in solving the problem—set representation and measure of similarity. Particularly the query set and the sets in dataset collection can have varying cardinalities. The training collection is large enough such that linear scan is impractical. We propose a simple representation scheme that encodes both statistical and structural information of the sets. The derived representations are integrated in a kernel framework for flexible similarity measurement. For the query set process we adopt a learning-to-hash pipeline that turns the kernel representations into hash bits based on simple learners using multiple kernel learning. Experiments on two visual retrieval datasets show unambiguously that our set-to-set hashing framework outperforms prior methods that do not take the set-to-set search setting.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is a basic tool for dimensionality reduction employed in several aspects of machine learning. However the perfomance analysis is often carried out under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function is used without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured input. In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing namely similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et al. NIPS12 and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. ICML09 both of which have found numerous applications i.e. in approximate near-neighbour search with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM. We consider the recent mixed tabulation hash function of Dahlgaard et al. FOCS15 which was proved theoretically to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications including the above OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar when the input vectors are sparse. Our main contribution however is an experimental comparison of different hashing schemes when used inside FH OPH and LSH. We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the classic multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work well on sufficiently random data but we demonstrate that in the above applications it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and synthetic data. We also compare with the very popular MurmurHash3 which has no proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to truly random hashing in our experiments. However mixed tabulation was 4037; faster than MurmurHash3 and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on all possible input making it more reliable.</p>

	<td><p>Hash codes are efficient data representations for coping with the ever growing amounts of data. In this paper we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests with near-optimal information-theoretic code aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme where random trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting 1 for the visited tree leaf and 0 for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class distance for the two random class groups. Finally we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets while performing at the level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while utilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation. This work proposes a principled and robust procedure to train and deploy in parallel an ensemble of light-weight CNNs instead of simply going deeper.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a widely-used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. There has been considerable research on generating efficient image representation via the deep-network-based hashing methods. However the issue of efficient searching in the deep representation space remains largely unsolved. To this end we propose a simple yet efficient deep-network-based multi-index hashing method for simultaneously learning the powerful image representation and the efficient searching. To achieve these two goals we introduce the multi-index hashing (MIH) mechanism into the proposed deep architecture which divides the binary codes into multiple substrings. Due to the non-uniformly distributed codes will result in inefficiency searching we add the two balanced constraints at feature-level and instance-level respectively. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image retrieval datasets show that the learned balanced binary codes bring dramatic speedups and achieve comparable performance over the existing baselines.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of image and video data on the web hashing has been extensively studied for image or video search in recent years. Benefiting from recent advances in deep learning deep hashing methods have achieved promising results for image retrieval. However there are some limitations of previous deep hashing methods (e.g. the semantic information is not fully exploited). In this paper we develop a deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm based on the assumption that the learned binary codes should be ideal for classification. Both the pairwise label information and the classification information are used to learn the hash codes within one stream framework. We constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly which is rarely investigated in deep hashing algorithm. Because of the discrete nature of hash codes an alternating minimization method is used to optimize the objective function. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p>

In this paper we first address a key challenge for online hashing the binary codes for indexed data must be recomputed to keep pace with updates to the hash functions. We propose an efficient quality measure for hash functions based on an information-theoretic quantity mutual information and use it successfully as a criterion to eliminate unnecessary hash table updates. Next we also show how to optimize the mutual information objective using stochastic gradient descent. We thus develop a novel hashing method MIHash that can be used in both online and batch settings. Experiments on image retrieval benchmarks (including a 2.5M image dataset) confirm the effectiveness of our formulation both in reducing hash table recomputations and in learning high-quality hash functions.</p>

	<td><p>There is a growing trend in studying deep hashing methods for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) where hash functions and binary codes are learnt using deep convolutional neural networks and then the binary codes can be used to do approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. All the existing deep hashing papers report their methods superior performance over the traditional hashing methods according to their experimental results. However there are serious flaws in the evaluations of existing deep hashing papers (1) The datasets they used are too small and simple to simulate the real CBIR situation. (2) They did not correctly include the search time in their evaluation criteria while the search time is crucial in real CBIR systems. (3) The performance of some unsupervised hashing algorithms (e.g. LSH) can easily be boosted if one uses multiple hash tables which is an important factor should be considered in the evaluation while most of the deep hashing papers failed to do so. We re-evaluate several state-of-the-art deep hashing methods with a carefully designed experimental setting. Empirical results reveal that the performance of these deep hashing methods are inferior to multi-table IsoH a very simple unsupervised hashing method. Thus the conclusions in all the deep hashing papers should be carefully re-examined.</p>

	<td><p>With the explosive growth of image databases deep hashing which learns compact binary descriptors for images has become critical for fast image retrieval. Many existing deep hashing methods leverage quantization loss defined as distance between the features before and after quantization to reduce the error from binarizing features. While minimizing the quantization loss guarantees that quantization has minimal effect on retrieval accuracy it unfortunately significantly reduces the expressiveness of features even before the quantization. In this paper we show that the above definition of quantization loss is too restricted and in fact not necessary for maintaining high retrieval accuracy. We therefore propose a new form of quantization loss measured in triplets. The core idea of the triplet quantization loss is to learn discriminative real-valued descriptors which lead to minimal loss on retrieval accuracy after quantization. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark data sets of different scales CIFAR-10 and In-shop demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. Moreover we show that the compact binary descriptors obtained with triplet quantization loss lead to very small performance drop after quantization.</p>

We integrate spatial information for discriminative visual representation by partitioning the pedestrian image into horizontal parts. Specifically Part-based Deep Hashing (PDH) is proposed in which batches of triplet samples are employed as the input of the deep hashing architecture. Each triplet sample contains two pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity and one pedestrian image (or part) of the different identity. A triplet loss function is employed with a constraint that the Hamming distance of pedestrian images (or parts) with the same identity is smaller than ones with the different identity. In the experiment we show that the proposed Part-based Deep Hashing method yields very competitive re-id accuracy on the large-scale Market-1501 and Market-1501+500K datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search because of its storage and search efficiency. Recent work has found that deep supervised hashing can significantly outperform non-deep supervised hashing in many applications. However most existing deep supervised hashing methods adopt a symmetric strategy to learn one deep hash function for both query points and database (retrieval) points. The training of these symmetric deep supervised hashing methods is typically time-consuming which makes them hard to effectively utilize the supervised information for cases with large-scale database. In this paper we propose a novel deep supervised hashing method called asymmetric deep supervised hashing (ADSH) for large-scale nearest neighbor search. ADSH treats the query points and database points in an asymmetric way. More specifically ADSH learns a deep hash function only for query points while the hash codes for database points are directly learned. The training of ADSH is much more efficient than that of traditional symmetric deep supervised hashing methods. Experiments show that ADSH can achieve state-of-the-art performance in real applications.</p>

In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing method named Deep Discrete Hashing (DDH) for large-scale image retrieval and classification. In the proposed framework we address two main problems 1) how to directly learn discrete binary codes 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval and classification in an unsupervised way We resolve these problems by introducing an intermediate variable and a loss function steering the learning process which is based on the neighborhood structure in the original space.

	<td><p>Hashing aims at generating highly compact similarity preserving code words which are well suited for large-scale image retrieval tasks. Most existing hashing methods first encode the images as a vector of hand-crafted features followed by a separate binarization step to generate hash codes. This two-stage process may produce sub-optimal encoding. In this paper for the first time we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing through residual learning termed Deep Residual Hashing (DRH) for an end-to-end simultaneous representation learning and hash coding. The DRH model constitutes four key elements (1) a sub-network with multiple stacked residual blocks; (2) hashing layer for binarization; (3) supervised retrieval loss function based on neighbourhood component analysis for similarity preserving embedding; and (4) hashing related losses and regularisation to control the quantization error and improve the quality of hash coding. We present results of extensive experiments on a large public chest x-ray image database with co-morbidities and discuss the outcome showing substantial improvements over the latest state-of-the art methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has emerged as a popular technique for large-scale similarity search. Most learning-based hashing methods generate compact yet correlated hash codes. However this redundancy is storage-inefficient. Hence we propose a lossless variable-length hashing (VLH) method that is both storage- and search-efficient. Storage efficiency is achieved by converting the fixed-length hash code into a variable-length code. Search efficiency is obtained by using a multiple hash table structure. With VLH we are able to deliberately add redundancy into hash codes to improve retrieval performance with little sacrifice in storage efficiency or search complexity. In particular we propose a block K-means hashing (B-KMH) method to obtain significantly improved retrieval performance with no increase in storage and marginal increase in computational cost.</p>

	<td><p>In supervised binary hashing one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem nonconvex and nonsmooth because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training solving a continuous optimization and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results but the hash function was still learned a posteriori which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as an iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.</p>

	<td><p>Binary hashing is a well-known approach for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in information retrieval. Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable but it also improves over the more complex coupled objective function and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has shown its efficiency and effectiveness in facilitating large-scale multimedia applications. Supervised knowledge e.g. semantic labels or pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However confronted with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the Web existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual labelling. In this paper we propose a novel hashing scheme termed emphzero-shot hashing (ZSH) which compresses images of unseen categories to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of seen categories. Specifically we project independent data labels i.e. 0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space where semantic relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover in order to cope with the semantic shift problem we rotate the embedded space to more suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime to exert positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions we further propose to preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes. Besides we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing methods have attracted much attention for large scale image retrieval. Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently. However existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one hand a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to the discrete Hamming distance which raises a critical issue of image retrieval where fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand different hash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently and treating them equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the above two problems we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH) approach which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by weighted Hamming distance. First a novel deep hashing network is proposed to learn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly so that the learned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different image classes. Second a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed which rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing its semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image retrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance which can provide more accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance. Experiments on four widely used datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms eight state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful tool for sublinear-time approximate nearest neighbor search and a variety of hashing schemes have been proposed for different dissimilarity measures. However hash codes significantly depend on the dissimilarity which prohibits users from adjusting the dissimilarity at query time. In this paper we propose multiple purpose LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash codes for different dissimilarities. mp-LSH supports L2 cosine and inner product dissimilarities and their corresponding weighted sums where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus mp-LSH enables us for example to retrieve similar items to a query with the user preference taken into account to find a similar material to a query with some properties (stability utility etc.) optimized and to turn on or off a part of multi-modal information (brightness color audio text etc.) in image/video retrieval. We theoretically and empirically analyze the performance of three variants of mp-LSH and demonstrate their usefulness on real-world data sets.</p>

A drawback of traditional LSH schemes is that they may have emphfalse negatives i.e. the recall is less than 10037;. This limits the applicability of LSH in settings requiring precise performance guarantees. Building on the recent theoretical CoveringLSH construction that eliminates false negatives we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for Hamming space called emphFast CoveringLSH (fcLSH). Inheriting the design benefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports all near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic improvement to the hash function computation time from ((dL)) to ((d + L)) where (d) is the dimensionality of data and (L) is the number of hash tables. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that emphfcLSH is comparable (and often superior) to traditional hashing-based approaches for search radius up to 20 in high-dimensional Hamming space.</p>

During the past decade numerous hashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm claims outperform other state-of-the-art hashing methods. However the evaluation of these hashing papers was not thorough enough and those claims should be re-examined. The ultimate goal of an ANNS method is returning the most accurate answers (nearest neighbors) in the shortest time. If implemented correctly almost all the hashing methods will have their performance improved as the code length increases. However many existing hashing papers only report the performance with the code length shorter than 128. In this paper we carefully revisit the problem of search with a hash index and analyze the pros and cons of two popular hash index search procedures. Then we proposed a very simple but effective two level index structures and make a thorough comparison of eleven popular hashing algorithms. Surprisingly the random-projection-based Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the best performed algorithm which is in contradiction to the claims in all the other ten hashing papers. Despite the extreme simplicity of random-projection-based LSH our results show that the capability of this algorithm has been far underestimated. For the sake of reproducibility all the codes used in the paper are released on GitHub which can be used as a testing platform for a fair comparison between various hashing algorithms.</p>

We propose a simple rejection type sampling scheme based on a carefully designed red-green map where we show that the number of rejected sample has exactly the same distribution as weighted minwise sampling. The running time of our method for many practical datasets is an order of magnitude smaller than existing methods. Experimental evaluations on real datasets show that for computing 500 WMH our proposal can be 60000x faster than the Ioffes method without losing any accuracy.

NIP is able to produce compact and well-performing descriptors with visual representations extracted from convolutional neural networks. We specifically incorporate scale translation and rotation invariances but the scheme can be extended to any arbitrary sets of transformations. We also show that using moments of increasing order throughout nesting is important.

Feature hashing has been used successfully to create document vectors in related tasks like document classification. In this work we show that feature hashing can be applied to obtain word embeddings in linear time with the size of the data. The results show that this algorithm that does not need training is able to capture the semantic meaning of words. We compare the results against GloVe showing that they are similar. As far as we know this is the first application of feature hashing to the word embeddings problem and the results indicate this is a scalable technique with practical results for NLP applications.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing methods have been widely used for efficient similarity retrieval on large scale image database. Traditional hashing methods learn hash functions to generate binary codes from hand-crafted features which achieve limited accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently several deep hashing methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate more discriminative feature representations. However these deep hashing methods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios which only exploit the semantic similarity information but ignore the underlying data structures. In this paper we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach to perform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving semantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are as follows (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the empirical error on labeled data as well as the embedding error on both labeled and unlabeled data which can preserve the semantic similarity and capture the meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing. (2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit both labeled and unlabeled data in which we propose an online graph construction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training to better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge the proposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash code learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion. Experimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Binary hashing is a well-known approach for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in information retrieval. Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable but it also improves over the more complex coupled objective function and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a commonly used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval. For image retrieval deep-networks-based hashing methods are appealing since they can simultaneously learn effective image representations and compact hash codes. This paper focuses on deep-networks-based hashing for multi-label images each of which may contain objects of multiple categories. In most existing hashing methods each image is represented by one piece of hash code which is referred to as semantic hashing. This setting may be suboptimal for multi-label image retrieval. To solve this problem we propose a deep architecture that learns textbfinstance-aware image representations for multi-label image data which are organized in multiple groups with each group containing the features for one category. The instance-aware representations not only bring advantages to semantic hashing but also can be used in category-aware hashing in which an image is represented by multiple pieces of hash codes and each piece of code corresponds to a category. Extensive evaluations conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that for both semantic hashing and category-aware hashing the proposed method shows substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>Recent years have seen more and more demand for a unified framework to address multiple realistic image retrieval tasks concerning both category and attributes. Considering the scale of modern datasets hashing is favorable for its low complexity. However most existing hashing methods are designed to preserve one single kind of similarity thus improper for dealing with the different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation we propose a new hashing method named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH) which jointly preserves the category and attribute similarities by exploiting the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to hierarchically capture the correlations between category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels are scarce our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework the binary codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network outputs of a binary-like layer and the attributes can be recovered from the codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval task while being more compact than the compared methods.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing is one of the most popular and powerful approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for large-scale image retrieval. Most traditional hashing methods first represent images as off-the-shelf visual features and then produce hashing codes in a separate stage. However off-the-shelf visual features may not be optimally compatible with the hash code learning procedure which may result in sub-optimal hash codes. Recently deep hashing methods have been proposed to simultaneously learn image features and hash codes using deep neural networks and have shown superior performance over traditional hashing methods. Most deep hashing methods are given supervised information in the form of pairwise labels or triplet labels. The current state-of-the-art deep hashing method DPSH~citeli2015feature which is based on pairwise labels performs image feature learning and hash code learning simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of pairwise similarities. Inspired by DPSH~citeli2015feature we propose a triplet label based deep hashing method which aims to maximize the likelihood of the given triplet labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all the baselines on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets including the state-of-the-art method DPSH~citeli2015feature and all the previous triplet label based deep hashing methods.</p>

We then propose two alternative protocols for supervised hashing one based on retrieval on a disjoint set of classes and another based on transfer learning to new classes.

To address these issues we propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be scalable to large-scale datasets. First the discrete learning procedure is decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and binary codes learning scheme which makes the learning procedure more efficient. Second we adopt the Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based Batch Coordinate Descent method such that the time and space complexity is reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to incorporate with arbitrary hash function including deep neural networks and kernel methods.

	<td><p>Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient hard sample mining is usually employed with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-based image hashing represents crucial technique for visual data storage reduction and expedited image search. Conventional hashing schemes typically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions which separates the procedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and non-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image classification and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks. On all benchmarks our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular our algorithm achieves a near-perfect 0.99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy with only 12 bits on MNIST and a new record of 0.74 on the CIFAR10 dataset. In comparison the best accuracies obtained on CIFAR10 by existing hashing algorithms without or with deep networks are known to be 0.36 and 0.58 respectively.</p>

We formulate the ranking subspace learning problem as the optimization of a piece-wise linear convex-concave function and present two versions of our algorithm one with independent optimization of each hash bit and the other exploiting a sequential learning framework.

	<td><p>Extracting informative image features and learning effective approximate hashing functions are two crucial steps in image retrieval . Conventional methods often study these two steps separately e.g. learning hash functions from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile the bit lengths of output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods neglecting the significance level of different bits and restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. Specifically we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples we maximize the margin between matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency i.e. images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.</p>

However most of the existing methods address only one or two of the above mentioned requirements. In this work we present a method based on randomized locality sensitive hashing which tries to address all of the above requirements simultaneously. While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency we argue that one can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs between accuracy and diversity. We extend our method to the problem of multi-label prediction where the goal is to output a diverse and accurate set of labels for a given document in real-time. Moreover we introduce a new notion to simultaneously evaluate a methods performance for both the precision and diversity measures. Finally we present empirical results on several different retrieval tasks and show that our method retrieves diverse and accurate images/labels while ensuring (100x)-speed-up over the existing diverse retrieval approaches.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing-based methods seek compact and efficient binary codes that preserve the neighborhood structure in the original data space. For most existing hashing methods an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-crafted visual feature followed by a hash projection and quantization step to get the compact binary vector. Most of the hand-crafted features just encode the low-level information of the input the feature may not preserve the semantic similarities of images pairs. Meanwhile the hashing function learning process is independent with the feature representation so the feature may not be optimal for the hashing projection. In this paper we propose a supervised hashing method based on a well designed deep convolutional neural network which tries to learn hashing code and compact representations of data simultaneously. The proposed model learn the binary codes by adding a compact sigmoid layer before the loss layer.

	<td><p>Supervised hashing methods are widely-used for nearest neighbor search in computer vision applications. Most state-of-the-art supervised hashing approaches employ batch-learners. Unfortunately batch-learning strategies can be inefficient when confronted with large training datasets. Moreover with batch-learners it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as a dataset continues to grow and diversify over time. Yet in many practical scenarios the dataset grows and diversifies; thus both the hash functions and the indexing must swiftly accommodate these changes. To address these issues we propose an online hashing method that is amenable to changes and expansions of the datasets. Since it is an online algorithm our approach offers linear complexity with the dataset size. Our solution is supervised in that we incorporate available label information to preserve the semantic neighborhood. Such an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the hash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is high then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the system especially for large indexes. Thus we also propose a framework to reduce hash table updates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art solutions on two benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.</p>

Each instance is assumed to be represented as a multiset of features e.g. a bag-of-words representation for documents. The major difficulty in finding cross-domain relationships is that the similarity between instances in different domains cannot be directly measured. To overcome this difficulty the proposed method embeds all the features of different domains in a shared latent space and regards each instance as a distribution of its own features in the shared latent space. To represent the distributions efficiently and nonparametrically we employ the framework of the kernel embeddings of distributions. The embedding is estimated so as to minimize the difference between distributions of paired instances while keeping unpaired instances apart. In our experiments we show that the proposed method can achieve high performance on finding correspondence between multi-lingual Wikipedia articles between documents and tags and between images and tags.</p>

	<td><p>An attractive approach for fast search in image databases is binary hashing where each high-dimensional real-valued image is mapped onto a low-dimensional binary vector and the search is done in this binary space. Finding the optimal hash function is difficult because it involves binary constraints and most approaches approximate the optimization by relaxing the constraints and then binarizing the result. Here we focus on the binary autoencoder model which seeks to reconstruct an image from the binary code produced by the hash function. We show that the optimization can be simplified with the method of auxiliary coordinates. This reformulates the optimization as alternating two easier steps one that learns the encoder and decoder separately and one that optimizes the code for each image. Image retrieval experiments using precision/recall and a measure of code utilization show the resulting hash function outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for binary hashing.</p>

	<td><p>A typical image retrieval pipeline starts with the comparison of global descriptors from a large database to find a short list of candidate matches. A good image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two contradictory requirements providing recall rates as high as possible and being as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image classification descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place of the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with better retrieval performances. Nevertheless the dimensionality of a typical DCNN descriptor –extracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the fully-connected layers– remains quite high at several thousands of scalar values. In this paper we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH) a fully unsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes –in the 32-256 bits range– from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two successive deep learning steps. First Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBM) a type of unsupervised deep neural nets are used to learn binary embedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired bitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the expense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN descriptor space. Then triplet networks a rank learning scheme based on weight sharing nets is used to fine-tune the binary embedding functions to retain as much as possible of the useful metric properties of the original space. A thorough empirical evaluation conducted on multiple publicly available dataset using DCNN descriptors shows that our method is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised schemes in the target bit range.</p>

Based on this assumption our approach dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH) constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design SSDH has a nice characteristic that classification and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover SSDH performs joint learning of image representations hash codes and classification in a point-wised manner and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy while the classification performance is not sacrificed.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity-preserving hashing is a widely-used method for nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. For most existing hashing methods an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. However such visual feature vectors may not be optimally compatible with the coding process thus producing sub-optimal hashing codes. In this paper we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing in which images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark image datasets show that the proposed simultaneous feature learning and hash coding pipeline brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art supervised or unsupervised hashing methods.</p>

	<td><p>With the rapid growth of web images hashing has received increasing interests in large scale image retrieval. Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.</p>

The efficiency of the new construction essentially emphmatches their bound when the search radius is not too large — e.g. when (cr = o(log(n)/loglog n)) where (n) is the number of points in the data set and when (cr = log(n)/k) where (k) is an integer constant. In general it differs by at most a factor (ln(4)) in the exponent of the time bounds. As a consequence LSH-based similarity search in Hamming space can avoid the problem of false negatives at little or no cost in efficiency.</p>

However their relative performance has not been studied for Subset Indexing. We investigate whether binary or n-ary coding works better under different retrieval strategies. This leads to the design of a new n-ary coding method Linear Subspace Quantization (LSQ) which unlike other n-ary encoders can be used as a similarity-preserving embedding. Experiments on image retrieval show that when Distance Estimation is used n-ary LSQ outperforms other methods. However when Subset Indexing is applied interestingly binary codings are more effective and binary LSQ achieves the best accuracy.</p>

Even though various binary hashing methods have been proposed very few methods are feasible for extremely high-dimensional features often used in visual tasks today. We propose a novel highly sparse linear hashing method based on pairwise rotations. The encoding cost of the proposed algorithm is ((n log n)) for n-dimensional features whereas that of the existing state-of-the-art method is typically ((n^2)). The proposed method is also remarkably faster in the learning phase. Along with the efficiency the retrieval accuracy is comparable to or slightly outperforming the state-of-the-art. Pairwise rotations used in our method are formulated from an analytical study of the trade-off relationship between quantization error and entropy of binary codes. Although these hashing criteria are widely used in previous researches its analytical behavior is rarely studied. All building blocks of our algorithm are based on the analytical solution and it thus provides a fairly simple and efficient procedure.</p>

The key idea is to exploit the redundancy in a large number of candidate sets obtained by independently generated random projections in order to reduce the number of expensive exact distance evaluations. The method is straightforward to implement using sparse projections which leads to a reduced memory footprint and fast index construction. Furthermore it enables grouping of the required computations into big matrix multiplications which leads to additional savings due to cache effects and low-level parallelization.

	<td><p>The explosive growth in big data has attracted much attention in designing efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications such as large-scale search and pattern matching finding the nearest neighbors to a query is a fundamental research problem. However the straightforward solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational complexity and memory requirement. In response Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior randomized hashing methods e.g. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) explore data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations. Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain metric spaces performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in many real-world applications. As a remedy new approaches incorporating data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have emerged. Such learning to hash methods exploit information such as data distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions. Importantly the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of insights pros and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash framework and representative techniques of various types including unsupervised semi-supervised and supervised. In addition we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep learning models. Finally we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area.</p>

	<td><p>The similarity searches that use high-dimensional feature vectors consisting of a vast amount of data have a wide range of application. One way of conducting a fast similarity search is to transform the feature vectors into binary vectors and perform the similarity search by using the Hamming distance. Such a transformation is a hashing method and the choice of hashing function is important. Hashing methods using hyperplanes or hyperspheres are proposed. One study reported here is inspired by Spherical LSH and we use hypersperes to hash the feature vectors. Our method called Eclipse-hashing performs a compactification of R^n by using the inverse stereographic projection which is a kind of Alexandrov compactification. By using Eclipse-hashing one can obtain the hypersphere-hash function without explicitly using hyperspheres. Hence the number of nonlinear operations is reduced and the processing time of hashing becomes shorter. Furthermore we also show that as a result of improving the approximation accuracy Eclipse-hashing is more accurate than hyperplane-hashing.</p>

	<td><p>We present a simple but powerful reinterpretation of kernelized locality-sensitive hashing (KLSH) a general and popular method developed in the vision community for performing approximate nearest-neighbor searches in an arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Our new perspective is based on viewing the steps of the KLSH algorithm in an appropriately projected space and has several key theoretical and practical benefits. First it eliminates the problematic conceptual difficulties that are present in the existing motivation of KLSH. Second it yields the first formal retrieval performance bounds for KLSH. Third our analysis reveals two techniques for boosting the empirical performance of KLSH. We evaluate these extensions on several large-scale benchmark image retrieval data sets and show that our analysis leads to improved recall performance of at least 1237; and sometimes much higher over the standard KLSH method.</p>

	<td><p>Hashing has emerged as a popular technique for fast nearest neighbor search in gigantic databases. In particular learning based hashing has received considerable attention due to its appealing storage and search efficiency. However the performance of most unsupervised learning based hashing methods deteriorates rapidly as the hash code length increases. We argue that the degraded performance is due to inferior optimization procedures used to achieve discrete binary codes. This paper presents a graph-based unsupervised hashing model to preserve the neighborhood structure of massive data in a discrete code space. We cast the graph hashing problem into a discrete optimization framework which directly learns the binary codes. A tractable alternating maximization algorithm is then proposed to explicitly deal with the discrete constraints yielding high-quality codes to well capture the local neighborhoods. Extensive experiments performed on four large datasets with up to one million samples show that our discrete optimization based graph hashing method obtains superior search accuracy over state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods especially for longer codes.</p>

	<td><p>Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving the Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques in contrast are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high-dimensional data. The complexities of these models and the problems with out-of-sample data have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding however. In this work how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties an efficient inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of t-SNE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved for example by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal rotations. In addition a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is developed by incorporating the label information which is shown to greatly advance the semantic retrieval performance.</p>

Searching with (un-normalized) inner product as the underlying similarity measure is a known difficult problem and finding hashing schemes for MIPS was considered hard. While the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS in this paper we extend the LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on a key observation that the problem of finding maximum inner products after independent asymmetric transformations can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search in classical settings. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing scheme for MIPS possible. Under the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework this paper provides an example of explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. The proposed hashing scheme leads to significant computational savings over the two popular conventional LSH schemes (i) Sign Random Projection (SRP) and (ii) hashing based on (p)-stable distributions for (L_2) norm (L2LSH) in the collaborative filtering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens (10M) datasets.</p>

While that is a substantial improvement our analysis reveals that the existing densification scheme is sub-optimal. In particular there is no enough randomness in that procedure which affects its accuracy on very sparse datasets. In this paper we provide a new densification procedure which is provably better than the existing scheme. This improvement is more significant for very sparse datasets which are common over the web. The improved technique has the same cost of (O(d + KL)) for query processing thereby making it strictly preferable over the existing procedure. Experimental evaluations on public datasets in the task of hashing based near neighbor search support our theoretical findings.</p>

In this paper we propose a way to overcome this limitation by enforcing the hash codes to be sparse. Sparse high-dimensional codes enjoy from the low false positive rates typical of long hashes while keeping the false negative rates similar to those of a shorter dense hashing scheme with equal number of degrees of freedom. We use a tailored feed-forward neural network for the hashing function. Extensive experimental evaluation involving visual and multi-modal data shows the benefits of the proposed method.</p>

	<td><p>Similarity search is critical for many database applications including the increasingly popular online services for Content-Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR). These services which include image search engines must handle an overwhelming volume of data while keeping low response times. Thus scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web-scale applications but most existing methods are sequential and target shared-memory machines. Here we address these issues with a distributed efficient and scalable index based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular techniques for similarity search but its poor referential locality properties has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data storage locality-aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing and multi-probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained an efficiency of 9037; in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In particular the original locality-aware data partition reduced the number of messages exchanged in 3037;. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with (10^9) 128-d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images. This is two orders of magnitude larger than datasets that previous LSH parallelizations could handle.</p>

In this paper we develop a simple textbfone permutation hashing scheme to address this important issue. While it is true that the preprocessing step can be parallelized it comes at the cost of additional hardware and implementation. Also reducing (k) permutations to just one would be much more textbfenergy-efficient which might be an important perspective as minwise hashing is commonly deployed in the search industry.

Recently hashing-based approaches e.g. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are proved to be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbors search. Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly a large number of hash tables (i.e. long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation we propose a novel hashing algorithm called em Density Sensitive Hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data. Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art hashing approaches.</p>

In this work we introduce a novel spherical quantization scheme to generate binary embedding of such data and analyze its properties. The number of quantization landmarks in this scheme grows exponentially with data dimensionality resulting in low-distortion quantization. We propose a very efficient method for computing the binary embedding using such large number of landmarks. Further a linear transformation is learned to minimize the quantization error by adapting the method to the input data resulting in improved embedding. Experiments on image and text retrieval applications show superior performance of the proposed method over other existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

LUCID is computable in linear time with respect to patch size and does not require floating point computation.

Typically the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper we propose a novel method called isotropic hashing (IsoHash) to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions which verifies the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances.</p>

	<td><p>High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efficiency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efficiency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efficiency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efficient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Specifically we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efficiently converted into an inverted indexing data structure which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing) as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).</p>

Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based methods have become a very popular approach for this problem. However most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search - i.e. efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this paper we present BayesLSH a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant BayesLSH-Lite which calculates similarities exactly is also presented. BayesLSH is able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally the quality of BayesLSHs output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate generation algorithms AllPairs and LSH BayesLSH enables significant speedups typically in the range 2x-20x for a wide variety of datasets.</p>

	<td><p>Minwise hashing is the standard technique in the context of search and databases for efficiently estimating set (e.g. high-dimensional 0/1 vector) similarities. Recently b-bit minwise hashing was proposed which significantly improves upon the original minwise hashing in practice by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value as opposed to using 64 bits. b-bit hashing is particularly effective in applications which mainly concern sets of high similarities (e.g. the resemblance 0.5). However there are other important applications in which not just pairs of high similarities matter. For example many learning algorithms require all pairwise similarities and it is expected that only a small fraction of the pairs are similar. Furthermore many applications care more about containment (e.g. how much one object is contained by another object) than the resemblance. In this paper we show that the estimators for minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing used in the current practice can be systematically improved and the improvements are most significant for set pairs of low resemblance and high containment.</p>

	<td><p>The ability of fast similarity search at large scale is of great importance to many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing we first find the optimal (l)-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning and then train (l) classifiers via supervised learning to predict the (l)-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.</p>

	<td><p>Computing two-way and multi-way set similarities is a fundamental problem. This study focuses on estimating 3-way resemblance (Jaccard similarity) using b-bit minwise hashing. While traditional minwise hashing methods store each hashed value using 64 bits b-bit minwise hashing only stores the lowest b bits (where b= 2 for 3-way). The extension to 3-way similarity from the prior work on 2-way similarity is technically non-trivial. We develop the precise estimator which is accurate and very complicated; and we recommend a much simplified estimator suitable for sparse data. Our analysis shows that (b)-bit minwise hashing can normally achieve a 10 to 25-fold improvement in the storage space required for a given estimator accuracy of the 3-way resemblance.</p>

Our second approach embeds the data into a vector space where the Euclidean norm reflects the desired distance between the original points and hyperplane query. Both use hashing to retrieve near points in sub-linear time. Our first methods preprocessing stage is more efficient while the second has stronger accuracy guarantees. We apply both to pool-based active learning taking the current hyperplane classifier as a query our algorithm identifies those points (approximately) satisfying the well-known minimal distance-to-hyperplane selection criterion.

By only storing the lowest (b) bits of each (minwise) hashed value (e.g. b=1 or 2) one can gain substantial advantages in terms of computational efficiency and storage space. We prove the basic theoretical results and provide an unbiased estimator of the resemblance for any b.

	<td><p>Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text image and video processing. While it is relatively easy to determine a suitable word dictionary for text documents there is no simple mapping from raw images or videos to dictionary terms. The classical approach builds a dictionary using vector quantization over a large set of useful visual descriptors extracted from a training set and uses a nearest-neighbor algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each dictionary word in documents to be encoded. More robust approaches have been proposed recently that represent each visual descriptor as a sparse weighted combination of dictionary words. While favoring a sparse representation at the level of visual descriptors those methods however do not ensure that images have sparse representation. In this work we use mixed-norm regularization to achieve sparsity at the image level as well as a small overall dictionary. This approach can also be used to encourage using the same dictionary words for all the images in a class providing a discriminative signal in the construction of image representations. Experimental results on a benchmark image classification dataset show that when compact image or dictionary representations are needed for computational efficiency the proposed approach yields better mean average precision in classification.</p>

This paper presents a simple practical algorithm allowing the user to for the first time directly control the true accuracy of NN search (in terms of ranks) while still achieving the large speedups over exact NN. Experiments with high-dimensional datasets show that it often achieves faster and more accurate results than the best-known distance-approximate method with much more stable behavior.</p>

We present a new online metric learning algorithm that updates a learned Mahalanobis metric based on LogDet regularization and gradient descent. We prove theoretical worst-case performance bounds and empirically compare the proposed method against existing online metric learning algorithms. To further boost the practicality of our approach we develop an online locality-sensitive hashing scheme which leads to efficient updates for approximate similarity search data structures.

By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigen- functions of manifolds we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel datapoint.

We show how t.o find people by finding putative body segments and then construct.- ing assemblies of those segments that are consist.ent with the con- straints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at. least nine segments it is not possible to present every group to a classi- fier. Instead the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classi- fier and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.</p>
