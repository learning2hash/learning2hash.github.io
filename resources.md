### Conferences and Workshops

* [Compact and Efficient Feature Representation and Learning in Computer Vision, ICCV 2019](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~lili/CEFRLatICCV2019.html): a workshop dedicated to compact feature learning, including binary hashing methods. 
* [International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications](http://www.sisap.org/2020/): a conference dedicated to similarity search

### Hashing Software Packages

### Presentations and Relevant Introductory Material

Please also see the excellent [tutorial slides](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/slides/L2H.pdf) of [Dr. Wu-Jun Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/) for a nice introduction to the field.

[Dr Victor Lavrenko](https://www.youtube.com/user/victorlavrenko) has two excellent youtube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arni-zkqMBA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgH0NP8Qxa8), describing the basics of locality sensitive hashing (LSH). These are ideal for those just entering the field or curious how to apply the method to their problem domain.

### Books

Some favourite books on the general topic of large-scale machine learning:

* [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/): great content throughout on all sorts of large-scale data mining topics from Hadoop to Google AdWords. Book includes a detailed treatment of LSH.

* [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html): arguably a classic book on information retrieval basics, very well-written, with a comprehensive overview of data indexing and retrieval.
