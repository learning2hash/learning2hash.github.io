<meta name="description" content="Learning high-quality feature embeddings efficiently and effectively is critical for the performance of web-scale machine learning systems. A typical model ingests hundreds of features with vocabularies on the order of millions to billions of tokens. The standard approach is to represent each feature value as a d-dimensional embedding, introducing hundreds of billions of parameters for extremely high-cardinality features. This bottleneck has led to substantial progress in alternative embedding algorithms. Many of these methods, however, make the assumption that each feature uses an independent embedding table. This work introduces a simple yet highly effective framework, Feature Multiplexing, where one single representation space is used across many different categorical features. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that multiplexed embeddings can be decomposed into components from each constituent feature, allowing models to distinguish between features. We show that multiplexed representations lead to Pareto-optimal parameter-accuracy tradeoffs for three public benchmark datasets. Further, we propose a highly practical approach called Unified Embedding with three major benefits: simplified feature configuration, strong adaptation to dynamic data distributions, and compatibility with modern hardware. Unified embedding gives significant improvements in offline and online metrics compared to highly competitive baselines across five web-scale search, ads, and recommender systems, where it serves billions of users across the world in industry-leading products." />

  <p><p>Learning high-quality feature embeddings efficiently and effectively is
critical for the performance of web-scale machine learning systems. A typical
model ingests hundreds of features with vocabularies on the order of millions
to billions of tokens. The standard approach is to represent each feature value
as a d-dimensional embedding, introducing hundreds of billions of parameters
for extremely high-cardinality features. This bottleneck has led to substantial
progress in alternative embedding algorithms. Many of these methods, however,
make the assumption that each feature uses an independent embedding table. This
work introduces a simple yet highly effective framework, Feature Multiplexing,
where one single representation space is used across many different categorical
features. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that multiplexed
embeddings can be decomposed into components from each constituent feature,
allowing models to distinguish between features. We show that multiplexed
representations lead to Pareto-optimal parameter-accuracy tradeoffs for three
public benchmark datasets. Further, we propose a highly practical approach
called Unified Embedding with three major benefits: simplified feature
configuration, strong adaptation to dynamic data distributions, and
compatibility with modern hardware. Unified embedding gives significant
improvements in offline and online metrics compared to highly competitive
