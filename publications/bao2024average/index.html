<meta name="description" content="We introduce average-distortion sketching for metric spaces. As in (worst-case) sketching, these algorithms compress points in a metric space while approximately recovering pairwise distances. The novelty is studying average-distortion: for any fixed (yet, arbitrary) distribution (\mu) over the metric, the sketch should not over-estimate distances, and it should (approximately) preserve the average distance with respect to draws from (\mu). The notion generalizes average-distortion embeddings into (\ell_1) [Rabinovich ‘03, Kush-Nikolov-Tang ‘21] as well as data-dependent locality-sensitive hashing [Andoni-Razenshteyn ‘15, Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. ‘18], which have been recently studied in the context of nearest neighbor search. (\bullet) For all (p \in (2, \infty)) and any (c) larger than a fixed constant, we give an average-distortion sketch for (([\Delta]^d, \ell_p)) with approximation (c) and bit-complexity (\text{poly}(2^{p/c} \cdot log(d\Delta))), which is provably impossible in (worst-case) sketching. (\bullet) As an application, we improve on the approximation of sublinear-time data structures for nearest neighbor search over (\ell_p) (for large (p &gt; 2)). The prior best approximation was (O(p)) [Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. ‘18, Kush-Nikolov-Tang ‘21], and we show it can be any (c) larger than a fixed constant (irrespective of (p)) by using (n^{O(p/c)}) space. We give some evidence that (2^{Ω(p/c)}) space may be necessary by giving a lower bound on average-distortion sketches which produce a certain probabilistic certificate of farness (which our sketches crucially rely on)." />

  <p><p>We introduce average-distortion sketching for metric spaces. As in
(worst-case) sketching, these algorithms compress points in a metric space
while approximately recovering pairwise distances. The novelty is studying
average-distortion: for any fixed (yet, arbitrary) distribution (\mu) over the
metric, the sketch should not over-estimate distances, and it should
(approximately) preserve the average distance with respect to draws from (\mu).
The notion generalizes average-distortion embeddings into (\ell_1) [Rabinovich
‘03, Kush-Nikolov-Tang ‘21] as well as data-dependent locality-sensitive
hashing [Andoni-Razenshteyn ‘15, Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. ‘18], which have
been recently studied in the context of nearest neighbor search.
  (\bullet) For all (p \in (2, \infty)) and any (c) larger than a fixed
constant, we give an average-distortion sketch for (([\Delta]^d, \ell_p)) with
approximation (c) and bit-complexity (\text{poly}(2^{p/c} \cdot
log(d\Delta))), which is provably impossible in (worst-case) sketching.
  (\bullet) As an application, we improve on the approximation of
sublinear-time data structures for nearest neighbor search over (\ell_p) (for
large (p &gt; 2)). The prior best approximation was (O(p))
[Andoni-Naor-Nikolov-et-al. ‘18, Kush-Nikolov-Tang ‘21], and we show it can be
any (c) larger than a fixed constant (irrespective of (p)) by using
(n^{O(p/c)}) space.
  We give some evidence that (2^{Ω(p/c)}) space may be necessary by giving
a lower bound on average-distortion sketches which produce a certain
probabilistic certificate of farness (which our sketches crucially rely on).</p>
