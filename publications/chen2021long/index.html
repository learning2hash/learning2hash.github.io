<meta name="description" content="Hashing, which represents data items as compact binary codes, has been becoming a more and more popular technique, e.g., for large-scale image retrieval, owing to its super fast search speed as well as its extremely economical memory consumption. However, existing hashing methods all try to learn binary codes from artificially balanced datasets which are not commonly available in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Long-Tail Hashing Network (LTHNet), a novel two-stage deep hashing approach that addresses the problem of learning to hash for more realistic datasets where the data labels roughly exhibit a long-tail distribution. Specifically, the first stage is to learn relaxed embeddings of the given dataset with its long-tail characteristic taken into account via an end-to-end deep neural network; the second stage is to binarize those obtained embeddings. A critical part of LTHNet is its extended dynamic meta-embedding module which can adaptively realize visual knowledge transfer between head and tail classes, and thus enrich image representations for hashing. Our experiments have shown that LTHNet achieves dramatic performance improvements over all state-of-the-art competitors on long-tail datasets, with no or little sacrifice on balanced datasets. Further analyses reveal that while to our surprise directly manipulating class weights in the loss function has little effect, the extended dynamic meta-embedding module, the usage of cross-entropy loss instead of square loss, and the relatively small batch-size for training all contribute to LTHNet’s success." />

  <p><p>Hashing, which represents data items as compact binary codes, has
been becoming a more and more popular technique, e.g., for large-scale image retrieval, owing to its super fast search speed as well
as its extremely economical memory consumption. However, existing hashing methods all try to learn binary codes from artificially
balanced datasets which are not commonly available in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Long-Tail Hashing Network
(LTHNet), a novel two-stage deep hashing approach that addresses
the problem of learning to hash for more realistic datasets where
the data labels roughly exhibit a long-tail distribution. Specifically,
the first stage is to learn relaxed embeddings of the given dataset
with its long-tail characteristic taken into account via an end-to-end deep neural network; the second stage is to binarize those
obtained embeddings. A critical part of LTHNet is its extended dynamic meta-embedding module which can adaptively realize visual
knowledge transfer between head and tail classes, and thus enrich
image representations for hashing. Our experiments have shown
that LTHNet achieves dramatic performance improvements over all
state-of-the-art competitors on long-tail datasets, with no or little
sacrifice on balanced datasets. Further analyses reveal that while to
our surprise directly manipulating class weights in the loss function
has little effect, the extended dynamic meta-embedding module, the
usage of cross-entropy loss instead of square loss, and the relatively
small batch-size for training all contribute to LTHNet’s success.</p>
