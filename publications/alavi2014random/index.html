<meta name="description" content="Recent advances suggest that encoding images through Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and then interpreting such matrices as points on Riemannian manifolds can lead to increased classification performance. Taking into account manifold geometry is typically done via (1) embedding the manifolds in tangent spaces, or (2) embedding into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). While embedding into tangent spaces allows the use of existing Euclidean-based learning algorithms, manifold shape is only approximated which can cause loss of discriminatory information. The RKHS approach retains more of the manifold structure, but may require non-trivial effort to kernelise Euclidean-based learning algorithms. In contrast to the above approaches, in this paper we offer a novel solution that allows SPD matrices to be used with unmodified Euclidean-based learning algorithms, with the true manifold shape well-preserved. Specifically, we propose to project SPD matrices using a set of random projection hyperplanes over RKHS into a random projection space, which leads to representing each matrix as a vector of projection coefficients. Experiments on face recognition, person re-identification and texture classification show that the proposed approach outperforms several recent methods, such as Tensor Sparse Coding, Histogram Plus Epitome, Riemannian Locality Preserving Projection and Relational Divergence Classification." />

  <p><p>Recent advances suggest that encoding images through Symmetric Positive
Definite (SPD) matrices and then interpreting such matrices as points on
Riemannian manifolds can lead to increased classification performance. Taking
into account manifold geometry is typically done via (1) embedding the
manifolds in tangent spaces, or (2) embedding into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Spaces (RKHS). While embedding into tangent spaces allows the use of existing
Euclidean-based learning algorithms, manifold shape is only approximated which
can cause loss of discriminatory information. The RKHS approach retains more of
the manifold structure, but may require non-trivial effort to kernelise
Euclidean-based learning algorithms. In contrast to the above approaches, in
this paper we offer a novel solution that allows SPD matrices to be used with
unmodified Euclidean-based learning algorithms, with the true manifold shape
well-preserved. Specifically, we propose to project SPD matrices using a set of
random projection hyperplanes over RKHS into a random projection space, which
leads to representing each matrix as a vector of projection coefficients.
Experiments on face recognition, person re-identification and texture
classification show that the proposed approach outperforms several recent
methods, such as Tensor Sparse Coding, Histogram Plus Epitome, Riemannian
Locality Preserving Projection and Relational Divergence Classification.</p>
