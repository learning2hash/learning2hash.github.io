  <p><p>Automated Vehicle License Plate (VLP) detection and recognition have ended up
being a significant research issue as of late. VLP localization and recognition
are some of the most essential techniques for managing traffic using digital
techniques. In this paper, four smart systems are developed to recognize
Egyptian vehicles license plates. Two systems are based on character
recognition, which are (System1, Characters Recognition with Classical Machine
Learning) and (System2, Characters Recognition with Deep Machine Learning). The
other two systems are based on the whole plate recognition which are (System3,
Whole License Plate Recognition with Classical Machine Learning) and (System4,
Whole License Plate Recognition with Deep Machine Learning). We use object
detection algorithms, and machine learning based object recognition algorithms.
The performance of the developed systems has been tested on real images, and
the experimental results demonstrate that the best detection accuracy rate for
VLP is provided by using the deep learning method. Where the VLP detection
accuracy rate is better than the classical system by 32%. However, the best
detection accuracy rate for Vehicle License Plate Arabic Character (VLPAC) is
provided by using the classical method. Where VLPAC detection accuracy rate is
better than the deep learning-based system by 6%. Also, the results show that
deep learning is better than the classical technique used in VLP recognition
processes. Where the recognition accuracy rate is better than the classical
system by 8%. Finally, the paper output recommends a robust VLP recognition
system based on both statistical and deep machine learning.</p>
