<meta name="description" content="Text classification of unseen classes is a challenging Natural Language Processing task and is mainly attempted using two different types of approaches. Similarity-based approaches attempt to classify instances based on similarities between text document representations and class description representations. Zero-shot text classification approaches aim to generalize knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of unknown classes to text documents. Although existing studies have already investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in literature do not provide a consistent comparison. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of different similarity-based and zero-shot approaches for text classification of unseen classes. Different state-of-the-art approaches are benchmarked on four text classification datasets, including a new dataset from the medical domain. Additionally, novel SimCSE and SBERT-based baselines are proposed, as other baselines used in existing work yield weak classification results and are easily outperformed. Finally, the novel similarity-based Lbl2TransformerVec approach is presented, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised text classification. Our experiments show that similarity-based approaches significantly outperform zero-shot approaches in most cases. Additionally, using SimCSE or SBERT embeddings instead of simpler text representations increases similarity-based classification results even further." />

  <p><p>Text classification of unseen classes is a challenging Natural Language
Processing task and is mainly attempted using two different types of
approaches. Similarity-based approaches attempt to classify instances based on
similarities between text document representations and class description
representations. Zero-shot text classification approaches aim to generalize
knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of
unknown classes to text documents. Although existing studies have already
investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in
literature do not provide a consistent comparison. This paper addresses this
gap by conducting a systematic evaluation of different similarity-based and
zero-shot approaches for text classification of unseen classes. Different
state-of-the-art approaches are benchmarked on four text classification
datasets, including a new dataset from the medical domain. Additionally, novel
SimCSE and SBERT-based baselines are proposed, as other baselines used in
existing work yield weak classification results and are easily outperformed.
Finally, the novel similarity-based Lbl2TransformerVec approach is presented,
which outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised text
classification. Our experiments show that similarity-based approaches
significantly outperform zero-shot approaches in most cases. Additionally,
using SimCSE or SBERT embeddings instead of simpler text representations
increases similarity-based classification results even further.</p>
