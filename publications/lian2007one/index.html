A hash function is constructed based on a three-layer neural network. The three neuron-layers are used to realize data confusion, diffusion and compression respectively, and the multi-block hash mode is presented to support the plaintext with variable length. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this hash function is one-way, with high key sensitivity and plaintext sensitivity, and secure against birthday attacks or meet-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, the neural network's property makes it practical to realize in a parallel way. These properties make it a suitable choice for data signature or authentication.
