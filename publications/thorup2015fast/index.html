<meta name="description" content="Randomized algorithms are often enjoyed for their simplicity but the hash functions employed to yield the desired probabilistic guarantees are often too complicated to be practical. Here we survey recent results on how simple hashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees. Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist 1970. Keys are viewed as consisting of c characters and we have precomputed character tables h_1…h_c mapping characters to random hash values. A key x=(x_1…x_c) is hashed to h_1x_1 oplus h_2x_2…..oplus h_cx_c. This schemes is very fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even 4-independent it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally obtained via higher independence e.g. linear probing and Cuckoo hashing. Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is twisted in a simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional properties Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for min-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number generator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and data-structures. Finally we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation functions applying one to the output of the other and show that this yields very high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman 1977. In fact w.h.p. for a given set of size proportional to that of the space consumed double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some more elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given time and space. While these tabulation schemes are all easy to implement and use their analysis is not." />
