<meta name="description" content="In this paper, we consider the problem of compressing a trie while supporting the powerful locate queries: to return the pre-order identifiers of all nodes reached by a path labeled with a given query pattern. Our result builds on top of the XBWT tree transform of Ferragina et al. [FOCS 2005] and generalizes the r-index locate machinery of Gagie et al. [SODA 2018, JACM 2020] based on the run-length encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT). Our first contribution is to propose a suitable generalization of the run-length BWT to tries. We show that this natural generalization enjoys several of the useful properties of its counterpart on strings: in particular, the transform natively supports counting occurrences of a query pattern on the trie’s paths and its size \(r\) captures the trie’s repetitiveness and lower-bounds a natural notion of trie entropy. Our main contribution is a much deeper insight into the combinatorial structure of this object. In detail, we show that a data structure of \(O(rlog n) + 2n + o(n)\) bits, where \(n\) is the number of nodes, allows locating the \(occ\) occurrences of a pattern of length \(m\) in nearly-optimal \(O(mlog\sigma + occ)\) time, where \(\sigma\) is the alphabet’s size. Our solution consists in sampling \(O(r)\) nodes that can be used as “anchor points” during the locate process. Once obtained the pre-order identifier of the first pattern occurrence (in co-lexicographic order), we show that a constant number of constant-time jumps between those anchor points lead to the identifier of the next pattern occurrence, thus enabling locating in optimal \(O(1)\) time per occurrence." />

  <p><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of compressing a trie while supporting
the powerful <em>locate</em> queries: to return the pre-order identifiers of all
nodes reached by a path labeled with a given query pattern. Our result builds
on top of the XBWT tree transform of Ferragina et al. [FOCS 2005] and
generalizes the <em>r-index</em> locate machinery of Gagie et al. [SODA 2018,
JACM 2020] based on the run-length encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT). Our
first contribution is to propose a suitable generalization of the run-length
BWT to tries. We show that this natural generalization enjoys several of the
useful properties of its counterpart on strings: in particular, the transform
natively supports counting occurrences of a query pattern on the trie’s paths
and its size \(r\) captures the trie’s repetitiveness and lower-bounds a natural
notion of trie entropy. Our main contribution is a much deeper insight into the
combinatorial structure of this object. In detail, we show that a data
structure of \(O(rlog n) + 2n + o(n)\) bits, where \(n\) is the number of nodes,
allows locating the \(occ\) occurrences of a pattern of length \(m\) in
nearly-optimal \(O(mlog\sigma + occ)\) time, where \(\sigma\) is the alphabet’s
size. Our solution consists in sampling \(O(r)\) nodes that can be used as
“anchor points” during the locate process. Once obtained the pre-order
identifier of the first pattern occurrence (in co-lexicographic order), we show
that a constant number of constant-time jumps between those anchor points lead
to the identifier of the next pattern occurrence, thus enabling locating in
optimal \(O(1)\) time per occurrence.</p>
