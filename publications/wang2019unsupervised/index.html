<meta name="description" content="Deep neural networks have gained tremendous success in a broad range of machine learning tasks due to its remarkable capability to learn semantic-rich features from high-dimensional data. However, they often require large-scale labelled data to successfully learn such features, which significantly hinders their adaption into unsupervised learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering, and limits their applications into critical domains where obtaining massive labelled data is prohibitively expensive. To enable unsupervised learning on those domains, in this work we propose to learn features without using any labelled data by training neural networks to predict data distances in a randomly projected space. Random mapping is a theoretically proven approach to obtain approximately preserved distances. To well predict these random distances, the representation learner is optimised to learn genuine class structures that are implicitly embedded in the randomly projected space. Empirical results on 19 real-world datasets show that our learned representations substantially outperform a few state-of-the-art competing methods in both anomaly detection and clustering tasks.

  <p><p>Deep neural networks have gained tremendous success in a broad range of
machine learning tasks due to its remarkable capability to learn semantic-rich
features from high-dimensional data. However, they often require large-scale
labelled data to successfully learn such features, which significantly hinders
their adaption into unsupervised learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering, and limits their applications into critical domains where obtaining
massive labelled data is prohibitively expensive. To enable unsupervised
learning on those domains, in this work we propose to learn features without
using any labelled data by training neural networks to predict data distances
in a randomly projected space. Random mapping is a theoretically proven
approach to obtain approximately preserved distances. To well predict these
random distances, the representation learner is optimised to learn genuine
class structures that are implicitly embedded in the randomly projected space.
Empirical results on 19 real-world datasets show that our learned
representations substantially outperform a few state-of-the-art competing
methods in both anomaly detection and clustering tasks. Code is available at
