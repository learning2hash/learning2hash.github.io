<meta name="description" content="Collaborative filtering (CF) is an important approach for recommendation system which is widely used in a great number of aspects of our life, heavily in the online-based commercial systems.

Consequently, CF approach is not just sensitive to the similarity measure, yet it is completely contingent on selection of that measure. While Jaccard - as one of those commonly used similarity measures for CF tasks - concerns the existence of ratings, other numerical measures such as cosine and Pearson concern the magnitude of ratings.

Therefore, in our continuous efforts to find the most effective similarity measures for CF, this research focuses on proposing new similarity measure via combining Jaccard with several numerical measures.
