<meta name="description" content="Due to its fast retrieval and storage efficiency capabilities, hashing has been widely used in nearest neighbor retrieval tasks. By using deep learning based techniques, hashing can outperform non-learning based hashing technique in many applications. However, we argue that the current deep learning based hashing methods ignore some critical problems (e.g., the learned hash codes are not discriminative due to the hashing methods being unable to discover rich semantic information and the training strategy having difficulty optimizing the discrete binary codes). In this paper, we propose a novel image hashing method, termed as \textbf{\underline{A}}symmetric \textbf{\underline{D}}eep \textbf{\underline{S}}emantic \textbf{\underline{Q}}uantization (\textbf{ADSQ}). \textbf{ADSQ} is implemented using three stream frameworks, which consist of one LabelNet and two ImgNets. The LabelNet leverages the power of three fully-connected layers, which are used to capture rich semantic information between image pairs. For the two ImgNets, they each adopt the same convolutional neural network structure, but with different weights (i.e., asymmetric convolutional neural networks). The two ImgNets are used to generate discriminative compact hash codes. Specifically, the function of the LabelNet is to capture rich semantic information that is used to guide the two ImgNets in minimizing the gap between the real-continuous features and the discrete binary codes. Furthermore, \textbf{ADSQ} can utilize the most critical semantic information to guide the feature learning process and consider the consistency of the common semantic space and Hamming space. Experimental results on three benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet) demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{ADSQ} can outperforms current state-of-the-art methods." />

  <p><p>Due to its fast retrieval and storage efficiency capabilities, hashing has
been widely used in nearest neighbor retrieval tasks. By using deep learning

in many applications. However, we argue that the current deep learning based
hashing methods ignore some critical problems (e.g., the learned hash codes are
not discriminative due to the hashing methods being unable to discover rich
semantic information and the training strategy having difficulty optimizing the
discrete binary codes). In this paper, we propose a novel image hashing method,
termed as \textbf{\underline{A}}symmetric \textbf{\underline{D}}eep

(\textbf{ADSQ}). \textbf{ADSQ} is implemented using three stream frameworks,
which consist of one <em>LabelNet</em> and two <em>ImgNets</em>. The
<em>LabelNet</em> leverages the power of three fully-connected layers, which are
used to capture rich semantic information between image pairs. For the two
