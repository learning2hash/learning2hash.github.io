<meta name="description" content="Recently, deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have, leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods." />

  <p><p>Recently, deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading
approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise
representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped
to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of
parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have,
leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose
a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the
deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake
images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative
adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec-
ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to
incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss
acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing
low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model
ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight
sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on
several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior
performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods.</p>
