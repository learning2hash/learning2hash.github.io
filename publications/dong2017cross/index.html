  <p><p>In order to retrieve unlabeled images by textual queries, cross-media
similarity computation is a key ingredient. Although novel methods are
continuously introduced, little has been done to evaluate these methods
together with large-scale query log analysis. Consequently, how far have these
methods brought us in answering real-user queries is unclear. Given baseline
methods that compute cross-media similarity using relatively simple text/image
matching, how much progress have advanced models made is also unclear. This
paper takes a pragmatic approach to answering the two questions. Queries are
automatically categorized according to the proposed query visualness measure,
and later connected to the evaluation of multiple cross-media similarity models
on three test sets. Such a connection reveals that the success of the
state-of-the-art is mainly attributed to their good performance on
visual-oriented queries, while these queries account for only a small part of
real-user queries. To quantify the current progress, we propose a simple
text2image method, representing a novel test query by a set of images selected
from large-scale query log. Consequently, computing cross-media similarity
between the test query and a given image boils down to comparing the visual
similarity between the given image and the selected images. Image retrieval
experiments on the challenging Clickture dataset show that the proposed
text2image compares favorably to recent deep learning based alternatives.</p>
