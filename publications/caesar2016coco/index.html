  <p><p>Semantic classes can be either things (objects with a well-defined shape,
e.g. car, person) or stuff (amorphous background regions, e.g. grass, sky).
While lots of classification and detection works focus on thing classes, less
attention has been given to stuff classes. Nonetheless, stuff classes are
important as they allow to explain important aspects of an image, including (1)
scene type; (2) which thing classes are likely to be present and their location
(through contextual reasoning); (3) physical attributes, material types and
geometric properties of the scene. To understand stuff and things in context we
introduce COCO-Stuff, which augments all 164K images of the COCO 2017 dataset
with pixel-wise annotations for 91 stuff classes. We introduce an efficient
stuff annotation protocol based on superpixels, which leverages the original
thing annotations. We quantify the speed versus quality trade-off of our
protocol and explore the relation between annotation time and boundary
complexity. Furthermore, we use COCO-Stuff to analyze: (a) the importance of
stuff and thing classes in terms of their surface cover and how frequently they
are mentioned in image captions; (b) the spatial relations between stuff and
things, highlighting the rich contextual relations that make our dataset
unique; (c) the performance of a modern semantic segmentation method on stuff
and thing classes, and whether stuff is easier to segment than things.</p>
