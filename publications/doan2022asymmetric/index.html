<meta name="description" content="Fast item ranking is an important task in recommender systems. In previous works graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have demonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic searching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network measures). However since these ANN approaches must go through the neural measures several times during ranking the computation is not practical if the neural measure is a large network. On the other hand fast item ranking using existing hashing-based approaches such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions. Hashing approaches however are attractive because they provide a principle and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper we propose a simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking problem that can be used for any type of measure including neural network measures. Specifically we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g. users and items) into a common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme. Then we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and contrastive samples to train the hashing model. We empirically validate the proposed method against the existing state-of-the-art fast item ranking methods in several combinations of non-linear searching functions and prominent datasets." />
