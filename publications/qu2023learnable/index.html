<meta name="description" content="Image-text retrieval aims to bridge the modality gap and retrieve cross-modal content based on semantic similarities. Prior work usually focuses on the pairwise relations (i.e., whether a data sample matches another) but ignores the higher-order neighbor relations (i.e., a matching structure among multiple data samples). Re-ranking, a popular post-processing practice, has revealed the superiority of capturing neighbor relations in single-modality retrieval tasks. However, it is ineffective to directly extend existing re-ranking algorithms to image-text retrieval. In this paper, we analyze the reason from four perspectives, i.e., generalization, flexibility, sparsity, and asymmetry, and propose a novel learnable pillar-based re-ranking paradigm. Concretely, we first select top-ranked intra- and inter-modal neighbors as pillars, and then reconstruct data samples with the neighbor relations between them and the pillars. In this way, each sample can be mapped into a multimodal pillar space only using similarities, ensuring generalization. After that, we design a neighbor-aware graph reasoning module to flexibly exploit the relations and excavate the sparse positive items within a neighborhood. We also present a structure alignment constraint to promote cross-modal collaboration and align the asymmetric modalities. On top of various base backbones, we carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrating the effectiveness, superiority, generalization, and transferability of our proposed re-ranking paradigm." />

  <p><p>Image-text retrieval aims to bridge the modality gap and retrieve cross-modal
content based on semantic similarities. Prior work usually focuses on the
pairwise relations (i.e., whether a data sample matches another) but ignores
the higher-order neighbor relations (i.e., a matching structure among multiple
data samples). Re-ranking, a popular post-processing practice, has revealed the
superiority of capturing neighbor relations in single-modality retrieval tasks.
However, it is ineffective to directly extend existing re-ranking algorithms to
image-text retrieval. In this paper, we analyze the reason from four
perspectives, i.e., generalization, flexibility, sparsity, and asymmetry, and
propose a novel learnable pillar-based re-ranking paradigm. Concretely, we
first select top-ranked intra- and inter-modal neighbors as pillars, and then
reconstruct data samples with the neighbor relations between them and the
pillars. In this way, each sample can be mapped into a multimodal pillar space
only using similarities, ensuring generalization. After that, we design a
neighbor-aware graph reasoning module to flexibly exploit the relations and
excavate the sparse positive items within a neighborhood. We also present a
structure alignment constraint to promote cross-modal collaboration and align
the asymmetric modalities. On top of various base backbones, we carry out
extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO,
demonstrating the effectiveness, superiority, generalization, and
transferability of our proposed re-ranking paradigm.</p>
