<meta name="description" content="In their seminal work, Broder \textit{et. al.}~\citep{BroderCFM98} introduces the \(\mathrm{minHash}\) algorithm that computes a low-dimensional sketch of high-dimensional binary data that closely approximates pairwise Jaccard similarity. Since its invention, \(\mathrm{minHash}\) has been commonly used by practitioners in various big data applications. Further, the data is dynamic in many real-life scenarios, and their feature sets evolve over time. We consider the case when features are dynamically inserted and deleted in the dataset. We note that a naive solution to this problem is to repeatedly recompute \(\mathrm{minHash}\) with respect to the updated dimension. However, this is an expensive task as it requires generating fresh random permutations. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic study of \(\mathrm{minHash}\) is recorded in the context of dynamic insertion and deletion of features. In this work, we initiate this study and suggest algorithms that make the \(\mathrm{minHash}\) sketches adaptable to the dynamic insertion and deletion of features. We show a rigorous theoretical analysis of our algorithms and complement it with extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Empirically we observe a significant speed-up in the running time while simultaneously offering comparable performance with respect to running \(\mathrm{minHash}\) from scratch. Our proposal is efficient, accurate, and easy to implement in practice." />
