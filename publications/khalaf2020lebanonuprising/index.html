The first is related to building a Lebanese to Modern Standard Arabic mapping dictionary that was used for the preprocessing of the tweets and the second is an attempt to move from sentiment analysis to emotion detection using emojis, and the two emotions we tried to predict were the “sarcastic” and “funny” emotions. We built a training set from the tweets collected in October 2019 and then we used this set to predict sentiments and emotions of the tweets we collected between May and August 2020.

  <p><p>Recent studies showed a huge interest in social networks sentiment analysis.
Twitter, which is a microblogging service, can be a great source of information
on how the users feel about a certain topic, or what their opinion is regarding
a social, economic and even political matter. On October 17, Lebanon witnessed
the start of a revolution; the LebanonUprising hashtag became viral on Twitter.
A dataset consisting of a 100,0000 tweets was collected between 18 and 21
October. In this paper, we conducted a sentiment analysis study for the tweets
in spoken Lebanese Arabic related to the LebanonUprising hashtag using
different machine learning algorithms. The dataset was manually annotated to
measure the precision and recall metrics and to compare between the different
algorithms. Furthermore, the work completed in this paper provides two more
contributions. The first is related to building a Lebanese to Modern Standard
Arabic mapping dictionary that was used for the preprocessing of the tweets and
the second is an attempt to move from sentiment analysis to emotion detection
using emojis, and the two emotions we tried to predict were the “sarcastic” and
“funny” emotions. We built a training set from the tweets collected in October
2019 and then we used this set to predict sentiments and emotions of the tweets
we collected between May and August 2020. The analysis we conducted shows the
variation in sentiments, emotions and users between the two datasets. The
results we obtained seem satisfactory especially considering that there was no
previous or similar work done involving Lebanese Arabic tweets, to our
knowledge.</p>
