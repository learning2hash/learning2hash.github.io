<meta name="description" content="Recently, multimodal sentiment analysis has seen remarkable advance and a lot of datasets are proposed for its development. In general, current multimodal sentiment analysis datasets usually follow the traditional system of sentiment/emotion, such as positive, negative and so on. However, when applied in the scenario of video recommendation, the traditional sentiment/emotion system is hard to be leveraged to represent different contents of videos in the perspective of visual senses and language understanding. Based on this, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, named baiDu Video Sentiment dataset (DuVideoSenti), and introduce a new sentiment system which is designed to describe the sentimental style of a video on recommendation scenery. Specifically, DuVideoSenti consists of 5,630 videos which displayed on Baidu, each video is manually annotated with a sentimental style label which describes the user’s real feeling of a video. Furthermore, we propose UNIMO as our baseline for DuVideoSenti. Experimental results show that DuVideoSenti brings new challenges to multimodal sentiment analysis, and could be used as a new benchmark for evaluating approaches designed for video understanding and multimodal fusion. We also expect our proposed DuVideoSenti could further improve the development of multimodal sentiment analysis and its application to video recommendations." />

  <p><p>Recently, multimodal sentiment analysis has seen remarkable advance and a lot
of datasets are proposed for its development. In general, current multimodal
sentiment analysis datasets usually follow the traditional system of
sentiment/emotion, such as positive, negative and so on. However, when applied
in the scenario of video recommendation, the traditional sentiment/emotion
system is hard to be leveraged to represent different contents of videos in the
perspective of visual senses and language understanding. Based on this, we
propose a multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, named baiDu Video Sentiment
dataset (DuVideoSenti), and introduce a new sentiment system which is designed
to describe the sentimental style of a video on recommendation scenery.
Specifically, DuVideoSenti consists of 5,630 videos which displayed on Baidu,
each video is manually annotated with a sentimental style label which describes
the user’s real feeling of a video. Furthermore, we propose UNIMO as our
baseline for DuVideoSenti. Experimental results show that DuVideoSenti brings
new challenges to multimodal sentiment analysis, and could be used as a new
benchmark for evaluating approaches designed for video understanding and
multimodal fusion. We also expect our proposed DuVideoSenti could further
improve the development of multimodal sentiment analysis and its application to
video recommendations.</p>
