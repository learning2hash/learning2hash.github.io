<meta name="description" content="Although self-/un-supervised methods have led to rapid progress in visual representation learning, these methods generally treat objects and scenes using the same lens. In this paper, we focus on learning representations for objects and scenes that preserve the structure among them. Motivated by the observation that visually similar objects are close in the representation space, we argue that the scenes and objects should instead follow a hierarchical structure based on their compositionality. To exploit such a structure, we propose a contrastive learning framework where a Euclidean loss is used to learn object representations and a hyperbolic loss is used to encourage representations of scenes to lie close to representations of their constituent objects in a hyperbolic space. This novel hyperbolic objective encourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing the magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and OpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of several baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also show that the properties of the learned representations allow us to solve various vision tasks that involve the interaction between scenes and objects in a zero-shot fashion.

  <p><p>Although self-/un-supervised methods have led to rapid progress in visual
representation learning, these methods generally treat objects and scenes using
the same lens. In this paper, we focus on learning representations for objects
and scenes that preserve the structure among them.
  Motivated by the observation that visually similar objects are close in the
representation space, we argue that the scenes and objects should instead
follow a hierarchical structure based on their compositionality. To exploit
such a structure, we propose a contrastive learning framework where a Euclidean
loss is used to learn object representations and a hyperbolic loss is used to
encourage representations of scenes to lie close to representations of their

encourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing
the magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and
OpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of
several baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also show that
the properties of the learned representations allow us to solve various vision
tasks that involve the interaction between scenes and objects in a zero-shot
