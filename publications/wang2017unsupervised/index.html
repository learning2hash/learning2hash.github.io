  <p><p>The recent rapid and tremendous success of deep convolutional neural networks
(CNN) on many challenging computer vision tasks largely derives from the
accessibility of the well-annotated ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets.
Nevertheless, unsupervised image categorization (i.e., without the ground-truth
labeling) is much less investigated, yet critically important and difficult
when annotations are extremely hard to obtain in the conventional way of
“Google Search” and crowd sourcing. We address this problem by presenting a
looped deep pseudo-task optimization (LDPO) framework for joint mining of deep
CNN features and image labels. Our method is conceptually simple and rests upon
the hypothesized “convergence” of better labels leading to better trained CNN
models which in turn feed more discriminative image representations to
facilitate more meaningful clusters/labels. Our proposed method is validated in
tackling two important applications: 1) Large-scale medical image annotation
has always been a prohibitively expensive and easily-biased task even for
well-trained radiologists. Significantly better image categorization results
are achieved via our proposed approach compared to the previous
state-of-the-art method. 2) Unsupervised scene recognition on representative
and publicly available datasets with our proposed technique is examined. The
LDPO achieves excellent quantitative scene classification results. On the MIT
indoor scene dataset, it attains a clustering accuracy of 75.3%, compared to
the state-of-the-art supervised classification accuracy of 81.0% (when both are
based on the VGG-VD model).</p>
