<meta name="description" content="Representation learning using network embedding has received tremendous attention due to its efficacy to solve downstream tasks. Popular embedding methods (such as deepwalk, node2vec, LINE) are based on a neural architecture, thus unable to scale on large networks both in terms of time and space usage. Recently, we proposed BinSketch, a sketching technique for compressing binary vectors to binary vectors. In this paper, we show how to extend BinSketch and use it for network hashing. Our proposal named QUINT is built upon BinSketch, and it embeds nodes of a sparse network onto a low-dimensional space using simple bi-wise operations. QUINT is the first of its kind that provides tremendous gain in terms of speed and space usage without compromising much on the accuracy of the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare QUINT with seven state-of-the-art network embedding methods for two end tasks - link prediction and node classification. We observe huge performance gain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 80x) due to its bit-wise nature to obtain node embedding. Moreover, QUINT is a consistent top-performer for both the tasks among the baselines across all the datasets. Our empirical observations are backed by rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the effectiveness of QUINT. In particular, we prove that QUINT retains enough structural information which can be used further to approximate many topological properties of networks with high confidence." />

attention due to its efficacy to solve downstream tasks. Popular embedding
methods (such as deepwalk, node2vec, LINE) are based on a neural architecture,
thus unable to scale on large networks both in terms of time and space usage.
Recently, we proposed BinSketch, a sketching technique for compressing binary

use it for network hashing. Our proposal named QUINT is built upon BinSketch,
and it embeds nodes of a sparse network onto a low-dimensional space using

gain for QUINT in terms of speedup (up to 7000x) and space saving (up to 80x)
