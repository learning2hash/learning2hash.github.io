However, the need for efficient and low latency inference forces the community to reconsider efficient approximate near-neighbor search in the item space. To this end, learning to index is gaining much interest in recent times. Methods have to trade between obtaining high accuracy while maintaining load balance and scalability in distributed settings. We propose a novel approach called IRLI (pronounced `early’), which iteratively partitions the items by learning the relevant buckets directly from the query-item relevance data.

We demonstrate this advantage by indexing 100 million dense vectors and surpassing the popular FAISS library by &gt;10% on recall." />

of mapping a query to a giant set of items. However, the need for efficient and
