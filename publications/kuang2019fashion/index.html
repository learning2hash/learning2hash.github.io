<meta name="description" content="Matching clothing images from customers and online shopping stores has rich applications in E-commerce. Existing algorithms encoded an image as a global feature vector and performed retrieval with the global representation. However, discriminative local information on clothes are submerged in this global representation, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Graph Reasoning Network (GRNet) on a Similarity Pyramid, which learns similarities between a query and a gallery cloth by using both global and local representations in multiple scales. The similarity pyramid is represented by a Graph of similarity, where nodes represent similarities between clothing components at different scales, and the final matching score is obtained by message passing along edges. In GRNet, graph reasoning is solved by training a graph convolutional network, enabling to align salient clothing components to improve clothing retrieval. To facilitate future researches, we introduce a new benchmark FindFashion, containing rich annotations of bounding boxes, views, occlusions, and cropping. Extensive experiments show that GRNet obtains new state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks, e.g., pushing the top-1, top-20, and top-50 accuracies on DeepFashion to 26%, 64%, and 75% (i.e., 4%, 10%, and 10% absolute improvements), outperforming competitors with large margins. On FindFashion, GRNet achieves considerable improvements on all empirical settings." />

  <p><p>Matching clothing images from customers and online shopping stores has rich
applications in E-commerce. Existing algorithms encoded an image as a global
feature vector and performed retrieval with the global representation. However,
discriminative local information on clothes are submerged in this global
representation, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Graph Reasoning Network (GRNet) on a Similarity Pyramid, which
learns similarities between a query and a gallery cloth by using both global
and local representations in multiple scales. The similarity pyramid is
represented by a Graph of similarity, where nodes represent similarities
between clothing components at different scales, and the final matching score
is obtained by message passing along edges. In GRNet, graph reasoning is solved
by training a graph convolutional network, enabling to align salient clothing
components to improve clothing retrieval. To facilitate future researches, we
introduce a new benchmark FindFashion, containing rich annotations of bounding
boxes, views, occlusions, and cropping. Extensive experiments show that GRNet
obtains new state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks, e.g.,
pushing the top-1, top-20, and top-50 accuracies on DeepFashion to 26%, 64%,
and 75% (i.e., 4%, 10%, and 10% absolute improvements), outperforming
competitors with large margins. On FindFashion, GRNet achieves considerable
improvements on all empirical settings.</p>
