<meta name="description" content="Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of foundation models AI systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm i.e. tool learning with foundation models combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy efficiency and automation in problem-solving. Despite its immense potential there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges opportunities and future endeavors in this field. To this end we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning including its cognitive origins the paradigm shift of foundation models and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework starting from understanding the user instruction models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. In general we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models." />
