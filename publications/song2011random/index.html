      <p><p>Following the success of hashing methods for multidimensional
indexing, more and more works are interested
in embedding visual feature space in compact hash codes.
Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures
but a complementary way to reduce both the memory
usage and the distance computation cost. Several data
dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to
closely fit data distribution and provide better selectivity
than usual random projections such as LSH. However, improvements
occur only for relatively small hash code sizes
up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper, this is mainly
due to the lack of independence between the produced hash
functions. We introduce a new hash function family that
attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather
than boosting the collision probability of close points, our
method focus on data scattering. By training purely random
splits of the data, regardless the closeness of the training
samples, it is indeed possible to generate consistently
more independent hash functions. On the other side, the
use of large margin classifiers allows to maintain good generalization
performances. Experiments show that our new
Random Maximum Margin Hashing scheme (RMMH) outperforms
