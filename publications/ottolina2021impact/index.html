  <p><p>State-of-the-art approaches for metaphor detection compare their literal - or
core - meaning and their contextual meaning using metaphor classifiers based on
neural networks. However, metaphorical expressions evolve over time due to
various reasons, such as cultural and societal impact. Metaphorical expressions
are known to co-evolve with language and literal word meanings, and even drive,
to some extent, this evolution. This poses the question of whether different,
possibly time-specific, representations of literal meanings may impact the
metaphor detection task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that examines the metaphor detection task with a detailed exploratory analysis
where different temporal and static word embeddings are used to account for
different representations of literal meanings. Our experimental analysis is
based on three popular benchmarks used for metaphor detection and word
embeddings extracted from different corpora and temporally aligned using
different state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that the usage of
different static word embedding methods does impact the metaphor detection task
and some temporal word embeddings slightly outperform static methods. However,
the results also suggest that temporal word embeddings may provide
representations of the core meaning of the metaphor even too close to their
contextual meaning, thus confusing the classifier. Overall, the interaction
between temporal language evolution and metaphor detection appears tiny in the
benchmark datasets used in our experiments. This suggests that future work for
the computational analysis of this important linguistic phenomenon should first
start by creating a new dataset where this interaction is better represented.</p>
