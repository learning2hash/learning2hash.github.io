<meta name="description" content="Proliferation of touch-based devices has made sketch-based image retrieval practical. While many methods exist for sketch-based object detection/image retrieval on small datasets, relatively less work has been done on large (web)-scale image retrieval. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for image retrieval from millions of images based on user-drawn sketches. Unlike existing methods for this problem which are sensitive to even translation or scale variations, our method handles rotation, translation, scale (i.e. a similarity transformation) and small deformations. The object boundaries are represented as chains of connected segments and the database images are pre-processed to obtain such chains that have a high chance of containing the object. This is accomplished using two approaches in this work: a) extracting long chains in contour segment networks and b) extracting boundaries of segmented object proposals. These chains are then represented by similarity-invariant variable length descriptors. Descriptor similarities are computed by a fast Dynamic Programming-based partial matching algorithm. This matching mechanism is used to generate a hierarchical k-medoids based indexing structure for the extracted chains of all database images in an offline process which is used to efficiently retrieve a small set of possible matched images for query chains. Finally, a geometric verification step is employed to test geometric consistency of multiple chain matches to improve results. Qualitative and quantitative results clearly demonstrate superiority of the approach over existing methods." />

  <p><p>Proliferation of touch-based devices has made sketch-based image retrieval
practical. While many methods exist for sketch-based object detection/image
retrieval on small datasets, relatively less work has been done on large
(web)-scale image retrieval. In this paper, we present an efficient approach
for image retrieval from millions of images based on user-drawn sketches.
Unlike existing methods for this problem which are sensitive to even
translation or scale variations, our method handles rotation, translation,
scale (i.e. a similarity transformation) and small deformations. The object
boundaries are represented as chains of connected segments and the database
images are pre-processed to obtain such chains that have a high chance of
containing the object. This is accomplished using two approaches in this work:
a) extracting long chains in contour segment networks and b) extracting
boundaries of segmented object proposals. These chains are then represented by
similarity-invariant variable length descriptors. Descriptor similarities are
computed by a fast Dynamic Programming-based partial matching algorithm. This
matching mechanism is used to generate a hierarchical k-medoids based indexing
structure for the extracted chains of all database images in an offline process
which is used to efficiently retrieve a small set of possible matched images
for query chains. Finally, a geometric verification step is employed to test
geometric consistency of multiple chain matches to improve results. Qualitative
and quantitative results clearly demonstrate superiority of the approach over
existing methods.</p>
