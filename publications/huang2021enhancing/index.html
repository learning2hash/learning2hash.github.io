<meta name="description" content="Aiming at recognizing the samples from novel categories with few reference samples, few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging problem. We found that the existing works often build their few-shot model based on the image-level feature by mixing all local-level features, which leads to the discriminative location bias and information loss in local details. To tackle the problem, this paper returns the perspective to the local-level feature and proposes a series of local-level strategies. Specifically, we present (a) a local-agnostic training strategy to avoid the discriminative location bias between the base and novel categories, (b) a novel local-level similarity measure to capture the accurate comparison between local-level features, and (c) a local-level knowledge transfer that can synthesize different knowledge transfers from the base category according to different location features. Extensive experiments justify that our proposed local-level strategies can significantly boost the performance and achieve 2.8%-7.2% improvements over the baseline across different benchmark datasets, which also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy." />

samples, few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging problem. We found that the
existing works often build their few-shot model based on the image-level
feature by mixing all local-level features, which leads to the discriminative
location bias and information loss in local details. To tackle the problem,
this paper returns the perspective to the local-level feature and proposes a
series of local-level strategies. Specifically, we present (a) a local-agnostic
training strategy to avoid the discriminative location bias between the base

accurate comparison between local-level features, and (c) a local-level
knowledge transfer that can synthesize different knowledge transfers from the
base category according to different location features. Extensive experiments
justify that our proposed local-level strategies can significantly boost the
performance and achieve 2.8%-7.2% improvements over the baseline across
different benchmark datasets, which also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.</p>
