  <p><p>Query Expansion (QE) is a well established method for improving retrieval
metrics in image search applications. When using QE, the search is conducted on
a new query vector, constructed using an aggregation function over the query
and images from the database. Recent works gave rise to QE techniques in which
the aggregation function is learned, whereas previous techniques were based on
hand-crafted aggregation functions, e.g., taking the mean of the query’s
nearest neighbors. However, most QE methods have focused on aggregation
functions that work directly over the query and its immediate nearest
neighbors. In this work, a hierarchical model, Graph Query Expansion (GQE), is
presented, which is learned in a supervised manner and performs aggregation
over an extended neighborhood of the query, thus increasing the information
used from the database when computing the query expansion, and using the
structure of the nearest neighbors graph. The technique achieves
state-of-the-art results over known benchmarks.</p>
