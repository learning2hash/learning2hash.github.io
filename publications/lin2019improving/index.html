Visual understanding aims to extract effective visual features. Visual matching aims to model a human notion of compatibility to compute a match between fashion items. Most previous studies rely on recommendation loss alone to guide visual understanding and matching. Although the features captured by these methods describe basic characteristics (e.g., color, texture, shape) of the input items, they are not directly related to the visual signals of the output items (to be recommended). This is problematic because the aesthetic characteristics (e.g., style, design), based on which we can directly infer the output items, are lacking.

  <p><p>The task of fashion recommendation includes two main challenges: visual
understanding and visual matching. Visual understanding aims to extract
effective visual features. Visual matching aims to model a human notion of
compatibility to compute a match between fashion items. Most previous studies
rely on recommendation loss alone to guide visual understanding and matching.
Although the features captured by these methods describe basic characteristics
(e.g., color, texture, shape) of the input items, they are not directly related
to the visual signals of the output items (to be recommended). This is
problematic because the aesthetic characteristics (e.g., style, design), based
on which we can directly infer the output items, are lacking. Features are
learned under the recommendation loss alone, where the supervision signal is
simply whether the given two items are matched or not. To address this problem,
we propose a neural co-supervision learning framework, called the FAshion
Recommendation Machine (FARM). FARM improves visual understanding by
incorporating the supervision of generation loss, which we hypothesize to be
able to better encode aesthetic information. FARM enhances visual matching by
introducing a novel layer-to-layer matching mechanism to fuse aesthetic
information more effectively, and meanwhile avoiding paying too much attention
to the generation quality and ignoring the recommendation performance.
Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show that FARM
outperforms state-of-the-art models on outfit recommendation, in terms of AUC
and MRR. Detailed analyses of generated and recommended items demonstrate that
FARM can encode better features and generate high quality images as references
to improve recommendation performance.</p>
