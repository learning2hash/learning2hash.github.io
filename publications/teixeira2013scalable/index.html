<meta name="description" content="Similarity search is critical for many database applications including the increasingly popular online services for Content45;Based Multimedia Retrieval (CBMR). These services which include image search engines must handle an overwhelming volume of data while keeping low response times. Thus scalability is imperative for similarity search in Web45;scale applications but most existing methods are sequential and target shared45;memory machines. Here we address these issues with a distributed efficient and scalable index based on Locality45;Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH is one of the most efficient and popular techniques for similarity search but its poor referential locality properties has made its implementation a challenging problem. Our solution is based on a widely asynchronous dataflow parallelization with a number of optimizations that include a hierarchical parallelization to decouple indexing and data storage locality45;aware data partition strategies to reduce message passing and multi45;probing to limit memory usage. The proposed parallelization attained an efficiency of 9037; in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores. In particular the original locality45;aware data partition reduced the number of messages exchanged in 3037;. Our parallel LSH was evaluated using the largest public dataset for similarity search (to the best of our knowledge) with 10^9 12845;d SIFT descriptors extracted from Web images. This is two orders of magnitude larger than datasets that previous LSH parallelizations could handle." />
