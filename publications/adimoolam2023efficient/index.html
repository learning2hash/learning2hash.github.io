<meta name="description" content="Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have led to widespread use of deep neural networks to extract building footprints from remote-sensing imagery. The success of such methods relies on the availability of large databases of high-resolution remote sensing images with high-quality annotations. The CrowdAI Mapping Challenge Dataset is one of these datasets that has been used extensively in recent years to train deep neural networks. This dataset consists of ( \sim\ )280k training images and ( \sim\ )60k testing images, with polygonal building annotations for all images. However, issues such as low-quality and incorrect annotations, extensive duplication of image samples, and data leakage significantly reduce the utility of deep neural networks trained on the dataset. Therefore, it is an imperative pre-condition to adopt a data validation pipeline that evaluates the quality of the dataset prior to its use. To this end, we propose a drop-in pipeline that employs perceptual hashing techniques for efficient de-duplication of the dataset and identification of instances of data leakage between training and testing splits. In our experiments, we demonstrate that nearly 250k(( \sim\ )90%) images in the training split were identical. Moreover, our analysis on the validation split demonstrates that roughly 56k of the 60k images also appear in the training split, resulting in a data leakage of 93%. The source code used for the analysis and de-duplication of the CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/yeshwanth95/CrowdAI_Hash_and_search ." />
