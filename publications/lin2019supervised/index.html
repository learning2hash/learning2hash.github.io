<meta name="description" content="In recent years, binary code learning, a.k.a hashing, has received extensive attention in large-scale multimedia retrieval. It aims to encode high-dimensional data points to binary codes, hence the original high-dimensional metric space can be efficiently approximated via Hamming space. However, most existing hashing methods adopted offline batch learning, which is not suitable to handle incremental datasets with streaming data or new instances. In contrast, the robustness of the existing online hashing remains as an open problem, while the embedding of supervised/semantic information hardly boosts the performance of the online hashing, mainly due to the defect of unknown category numbers in supervised learning. In this paper, we proposed an online hashing scheme, termed Hadamard Codebook based Online Hashing (HCOH), which aims to solve the above problems towards robust and supervised online hashing. In particular, we first assign an appropriate high-dimensional binary codes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes. Subsequently, LSH is adopted to reduce the length of such Hadamard codes in accordance with the hash bits, which can adapt the predefined binary codes online, and theoretically guarantee the semantic similarity. Finally, we consider the setting of stochastic data acquisition, which facilitates our method to efficiently learn the corresponding hashing functions via stochastic gradient descend (SGD) online. Notably, the proposed HCOH can be embedded with supervised labels and it not limited to a predefined category number. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the merits of the proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art methods.

  <p><p>In recent years, binary code learning, a.k.a hashing, has received extensive
attention in large-scale multimedia retrieval. It aims to encode
high-dimensional data points to binary codes, hence the original
high-dimensional metric space can be efficiently approximated via Hamming
space. However, most existing hashing methods adopted offline batch learning,
which is not suitable to handle incremental datasets with streaming data or new
instances. In contrast, the robustness of the existing online hashing remains
as an open problem, while the embedding of supervised/semantic information
hardly boosts the performance of the online hashing, mainly due to the defect
of unknown category numbers in supervised learning. In this paper, we proposed
an online hashing scheme, termed Hadamard Codebook based Online Hashing (HCOH),
which aims to solve the above problems towards robust and supervised online
hashing. In particular, we first assign an appropriate high-dimensional binary
codes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes to
each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes. Subsequently,
LSH is adopted to reduce the length of such Hadamard codes in accordance with
the hash bits, which can adapt the predefined binary codes online, and
theoretically guarantee the semantic similarity. Finally, we consider the
setting of stochastic data acquisition, which facilitates our method to
efficiently learn the corresponding hashing functions via stochastic gradient
descend (SGD) online. Notably, the proposed HCOH can be embedded with
supervised labels and it not limited to a predefined category number. Extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the merits of the
proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/lmbxmu/mycode/tree/master/2018ACMMM_HCOH.</p>
