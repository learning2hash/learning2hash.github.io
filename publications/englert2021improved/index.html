<meta name="description" content="In the Shortest Superstring problem, we are given a set of strings and we are asking for a common superstring, which has the minimum number of characters. The Shortest Superstring problem is NP-hard and several constant-factor approximation algorithms are known for it. Of particular interest is the GREEDY algorithm, which repeatedly merges two strings of maximum overlap until a single string remains. The GREEDY algorithm, being simpler than other well-performing approximation algorithms for this problem, has attracted attention since the 1980s and is commonly used in practical applications. Tarhio and Ukkonen (TCS 1988) conjectured that GREEDY gives a 2-approximation. In a seminal work, Blum, Jiang, Li, Tromp, and Yannakakis (STOC 1991) proved that the superstring computed by GREEDY is a 4-approximation, and this upper bound was improved to 3.5 by Kaplan and Shafrir (IPL 2005). We show that the approximation guarantee of GREEDY is at most \((13+\sqrt{57})/6 \approx 3.425\), making the first progress on this question since 2005. Furthermore, we prove that the Shortest Superstring can be approximated within a factor of \((37+\sqrt{57})/18\approx 2.475\), improving slightly upon the currently best \(2\frac{11}{23}\)-approximation algorithm by Mucha (SODA 2013)." />

  <p><p>In the Shortest Superstring problem, we are given a set of strings and we are
asking for a common superstring, which has the minimum number of characters.
The Shortest Superstring problem is NP-hard and several constant-factor
approximation algorithms are known for it. Of particular interest is the GREEDY
algorithm, which repeatedly merges two strings of maximum overlap until a
single string remains. The GREEDY algorithm, being simpler than other
well-performing approximation algorithms for this problem, has attracted
attention since the 1980s and is commonly used in practical applications.
  Tarhio and Ukkonen (TCS 1988) conjectured that GREEDY gives a
2-approximation. In a seminal work, Blum, Jiang, Li, Tromp, and Yannakakis
(STOC 1991) proved that the superstring computed by GREEDY is a
4-approximation, and this upper bound was improved to 3.5 by Kaplan and Shafrir
(IPL 2005).
  We show that the approximation guarantee of GREEDY is at most
\((13+\sqrt{57})/6 \approx 3.425\), making the first progress on this question
since 2005. Furthermore, we prove that the Shortest Superstring can be
approximated within a factor of \((37+\sqrt{57})/18\approx 2.475\), improving
slightly upon the currently best \(2\frac{11}{23}\)-approximation algorithm by
Mucha (SODA 2013).</p>
