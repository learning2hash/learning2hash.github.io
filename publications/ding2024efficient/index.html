  <p><p>Retrieval plays a fundamental role in recommendation systems, search, and
natural language processing by efficiently finding relevant items from a large
corpus given a query. Dot products have been widely used as the similarity
function in such retrieval tasks, thanks to Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)
that enabled efficient retrieval based on dot products. However,
state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms have migrated to learned similarities.
Such algorithms vary in form; the queries can be represented with multiple

retrieve the approximate top K results using MoL with a tight bound. We finally
compare our techniques with existing approaches, showing that MoL sets new
