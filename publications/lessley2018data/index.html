Hash tables are one of the most fundamental data structures for effectively storing and accessing sparse data, with widespread usage in domains ranging from computer graphics to machine learning. This study surveys the state-of-the-art research on data-parallel hashing techniques for emerging massively-parallel, many-core GPU architectures. Key factors affecting the performance of different hashing schemes are discovered and used to suggest best practices and pinpoint areas for further research.
