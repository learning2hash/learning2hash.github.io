  <p><p>Since its introduction, unsupervised representation learning has attracted a
lot of attention from the research community, as it is demonstrated to be
highly effective and easy-to-apply in tasks such as dimension reduction,
clustering, visualization, information retrieval, and semi-supervised learning.
In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework
called neighbor-encoder, in which domain knowledge can be easily incorporated
into the learning process without modifying the general encoder-decoder
architecture of the classic autoencoder.In contrast to autoencoder, which
reconstructs the input data itself, neighbor-encoder reconstructs the input
data’s neighbors. As the proposed representation learning problem is
essentially a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily
incorporated in the form of an appropriate definition of similarity between
objects. Based on that observation, our framework can leverage any
off-the-shelf similarity search algorithms or side information to find the
neighbor of an input object. Applications of other algorithms (e.g.,
association rule mining) in our framework are also possible, given that the
appropriate definition of neighbor can vary in different contexts. We have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in many diverse domains,
including images, text, and time series, and for various data mining tasks
including classification, clustering, and visualization. Experimental results
show that neighbor-encoder not only outperforms autoencoder in most of the
scenarios we consider, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
text document clustering.</p>
