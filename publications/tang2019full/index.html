  <p><p>In this paper, we first study in detail the relationship between minimal
linear codes and cutting blocking sets, which were recently introduced by
Bonini and Borello, and then completely characterize minimal linear codes as
cutting blocking sets. As a direct result, minimal projective codes of
dimension \(3\) and \(t\)-fold blocking sets with \(t\ge 2\) in projective planes are
identical objects. Some bounds on the parameters of minimal codes are derived
from this characterization. This confirms a recent conjecture by Alfarano,
Borello and Neri in [a geometric characterization of minimal codes and their
asymptotic performance, arXiv:1911.11738, 2019] about a lower bound of the
minimum distance of a minimal code. Using this new link between minimal codes
and blocking sets, we also present new general primary and secondary
constructions of minimal linear codes. As a result, infinite families of
minimal linear codes not satisfying the Aschikhmin-Barg’s condition are
obtained. In addition to this, the weight distributions of two subfamilies of
the proposed minimal linear codes are established. Open problems are also
presented.</p>
