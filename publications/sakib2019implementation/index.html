From the dataset, we have established a dataset which contains 17,823 images from 25 different categories. The images are divided into training and test dataset. Moreover, for the classification accuracies, we have used various combinations of hidden layer and epochs for different cases and made a comparison between them. The overall performance losses of the network for different cases also observed. Finally, we have achieved the best test accuracy of 100% and a training accuracy of 99.79%." />
