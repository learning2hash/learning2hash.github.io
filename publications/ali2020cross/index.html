App-based solutions have emerged for Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel “cross hashing” approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been exposed using \(k\)-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can offer like-for-like efficacy to the existing protocol." />

  <p><p>During the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, Contact Tracing emerged as an
essential tool for managing the epidemic. App-based solutions have emerged for
Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced
by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two
well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked
as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked
over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app
requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no

“cross hashing” approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure

exposed using \(k\)-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We
