<meta name="description" content="This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing which we dub prompt-based learning. Unlike traditional supervised learning which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(yx) prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x that has some unfilled slots and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work and organize existing work along several dimensions e.g.the choice of pre-trained models prompts and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources e.g. a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey and paperlist." />
