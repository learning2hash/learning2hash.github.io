  <p><p>With the rise of deep learning algorithms nowadays, scene image
representation methods have achieved a significant performance boost in
classification. However, the performance is still limited because the scene
images are mostly complex having higher intra-class dissimilarity and
inter-class similarity problems. To deal with such problems, there have been
several methods proposed in the literature with their advantages and

their advantages and disadvantages in image representation and classification
