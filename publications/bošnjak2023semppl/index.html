We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning – where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) – with a novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones through a (k)-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of (68.5%) and (76%) top-(1) accuracy when using a ResNet-(50) and training on (1%) and (10%) of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SemPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving (72.3%) and (78.3%) top-(1) accuracy on ImageNet with (1%) and (10%) labels, respectively, which improves absolute (+7.8%) and (+6.2%) over previous work.

  <p><p>Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of
supervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new
semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SemPPL),
that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative
representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning –
where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples
represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) – with a
novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we
leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones
through a (k)-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of
the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having
the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the
representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a
reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label
predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to
even better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised
methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of (68.5%) and (76%) top-(1)
accuracy when using a ResNet-(50) and training on (1%) and (10%) of labels on
ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SemPPL
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving (72.3%) and
(78.3%) top-(1) accuracy on ImageNet with (1%) and (10%) labels,
respectively, which improves absolute (+7.8%) and (+6.2%) over previous work.
SemPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as
well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance. We
