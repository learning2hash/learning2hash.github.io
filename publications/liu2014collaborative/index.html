<meta name="description" content="Hashing technique has become a promising approach for fast similarity search. Most of existing hashing research pursue the binary codes for the same type of entities by preserving their similarities. In practice, there are many scenarios involving nearest neighbor search on the data given in matrix form, where two different types of, yet naturally associated entities respectively correspond to its two dimensions or views. To fully explore the duality between the two views, we propose a collaborative hashing scheme for the data in matrix form to enable fast search in various applications such as image search using bag of words and recommendation using user-item ratings. By simultaneously preserving both the entity similarities in each view and the interrelationship between views, our collaborative hashing effectively learns the compact binary codes and the explicit hash functions for out-of-sample extension in an alternating optimization way. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three well-known datasets for search inside a single view and search across different views, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with significant accuracy gains ranging from 7.67% to 45.87% relatively." />

  <p><p>Hashing technique has become a promising approach for
fast similarity search. Most of existing hashing research
pursue the binary codes for the same type of entities by
preserving their similarities. In practice, there are many
scenarios involving nearest neighbor search on the data
given in matrix form, where two different types of, yet
naturally associated entities respectively correspond to its
two dimensions or views. To fully explore the duality
between the two views, we propose a collaborative hashing
scheme for the data in matrix form to enable fast search
in various applications such as image search using bag of
words and recommendation using user-item ratings. By
simultaneously preserving both the entity similarities in
each view and the interrelationship between views, our
collaborative hashing effectively learns the compact binary
codes and the explicit hash functions for out-of-sample
extension in an alternating optimization way. Extensive
evaluations are conducted on three well-known datasets
for search inside a single view and search across different
views, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with significant accuracy
gains ranging from 7.67% to 45.87% relatively.</p>
