<meta name="description" content="Compared with single-label image classification, multi-label image classification is more practical and challenging. Some recent studies attempted to leverage the semantic information of categories for improving multi-label image classification performance.

In this paper, we present an innovative path towards the solution of the multi-label image classification which considers it as a dictionary learning task.

classification is more practical and challenging. Some recent studies attempted
to leverage the semantic information of categories for improving multi-label
image classification performance. However, these semantic-based methods only
take semantic information as type of complements for visual representation
without further exploitation. In this paper, we present an innovative path
towards the solution of the multi-label image classification which considers it
