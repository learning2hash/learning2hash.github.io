In this paper, We make three main contributions to this area: (i) We transform this problem from the low-level keyword space to the high-level semantics space that we refer to as the “{\em image theme}”, (ii) Instead of treating each possible keyword independently, we use latent Dirichlet allocation to learn image themes from the associated texts in a training phase. Images are then annotated with image themes rather than keywords, using a modified continuous relevance model, which takes into account the spatial coherence and the visual continuity among images of common theme. (iii) To achieve more coherent annotations among images of common theme, we have integrated ConceptNet in learning the semantics of images, and hence augment image descriptions beyond annotations provided by humans. Images are thus further annotated by a few most significant words of the prominent image theme. Our extensive experiments show that a coherent theme-based image annotation using high-level semantics results in improved precision and recall as compared with equivalent classical keyword annotation systems." />
