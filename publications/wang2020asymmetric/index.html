  <p><p>Due to the superiority in similarity computation and database storage for
large-scale multiple modalities data, cross-modal hashing methods have
attracted extensive attention in similarity retrieval across the heterogeneous
modalities. However, there are still some limitations to be further taken into
account: (1) most current CMH methods transform real-valued data points into
discrete compact binary codes under the binary constraints, limiting the
capability of representation for original data on account of abundant loss of
information and producing suboptimal hash codes; (2) the discrete binary
constraint learning model is hard to solve, where the retrieval performance may
greatly reduce by relaxing the binary constraints for large quantization error;
(3) handling the learning problem of CMH in a symmetric framework, leading to
difficult and complex optimization objective. To address above challenges, in
this paper, a novel Asymmetric Correlation Quantization Hashing (ACQH) method
is proposed. Specifically, ACQH learns the projection matrixs of heterogeneous
modalities data points for transforming query into a low-dimensional
real-valued vector in latent semantic space and constructs the stacked
compositional quantization embedding in a coarse-to-fine manner for indicating
database points by a series of learnt real-valued codeword in the codebook with
the help of pointwise label information regression simultaneously. Besides, the
unified hash codes across modalities can be directly obtained by the discrete
iterative optimization framework devised in the paper. Comprehensive
experiments on diverse three benchmark datasets have shown the effectiveness
and rationality of ACQH.</p>
