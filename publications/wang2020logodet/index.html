<meta name="description" content="Logo detection has been gaining considerable attention because of its wide range of applications in the multimedia field, such as copyright infringement detection, brand visibility monitoring, and product brand management on social media. In this paper, we introduce LogoDet-3K, the largest logo detection dataset with full annotation, which has 3,000 logo categories, about 200,000 manually annotated logo objects and 158,652 images. LogoDet-3K creates a more challenging benchmark for logo detection, for its higher comprehensive coverage and wider variety in both logo categories and annotated objects compared with existing datasets. We describe the collection and annotation process of our dataset, analyze its scale and diversity in comparison to other datasets for logo detection. We further propose a strong baseline method Logo-Yolo, which incorporates Focal loss and CIoU loss into the state-of-the-art YOLOv3 framework for large-scale logo detection. Logo-Yolo can solve the problems of multi-scale objects, logo sample imbalance and inconsistent bounding-box regression. It obtains about 4% improvement on the average performance compared with YOLOv3, and greater improvements compared with reported several deep detection models on LogoDet-3K. The evaluations on other three existing datasets further verify the effectiveness of our method, and demonstrate better generalization ability of LogoDet-3K on logo detection and retrieval tasks. The LogoDet-3K dataset is used to promote large-scale logo-related research and it can be found at https://github.com/Wangjing1551/LogoDet-3K-Dataset." />

  <p><p>Logo detection has been gaining considerable attention because of its wide
range of applications in the multimedia field, such as copyright infringement
detection, brand visibility monitoring, and product brand management on social
media. In this paper, we introduce LogoDet-3K, the largest logo detection
dataset with full annotation, which has 3,000 logo categories, about 200,000
manually annotated logo objects and 158,652 images. LogoDet-3K creates a more
challenging benchmark for logo detection, for its higher comprehensive coverage
and wider variety in both logo categories and annotated objects compared with
existing datasets. We describe the collection and annotation process of our
dataset, analyze its scale and diversity in comparison to other datasets for
logo detection. We further propose a strong baseline method Logo-Yolo, which
incorporates Focal loss and CIoU loss into the state-of-the-art YOLOv3
framework for large-scale logo detection. Logo-Yolo can solve the problems of
multi-scale objects, logo sample imbalance and inconsistent bounding-box
regression. It obtains about 4% improvement on the average performance compared
with YOLOv3, and greater improvements compared with reported several deep
detection models on LogoDet-3K. The evaluations on other three existing
datasets further verify the effectiveness of our method, and demonstrate better
generalization ability of LogoDet-3K on logo detection and retrieval tasks. The
LogoDet-3K dataset is used to promote large-scale logo-related research and it
