<meta name="description" content="Hashing is very effective for many tasks in reducing the processing time and in compressing massive databases. Although lots of approaches have been developed to learn data-dependent hash functions in recent years, how to learn hash functions to yield good performance with acceptable computational and memory cost is still a challenging problem. Based on the observation that retrieval precision is highly related to the kNN classification accuracy, this paper proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method, which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make it scalable well to large problem, we propose a factorized neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable, we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and storage cost. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts." />

  <p><p>Hashing is very effective for many tasks in reducing the
processing time and in compressing massive databases. Although lots of approaches have been developed to learn
data-dependent hash functions in recent years, how to learn
hash functions to yield good performance with acceptable
computational and memory cost is still a challenging problem. Based on the observation that retrieval precision is
highly related to the kNN classification accuracy, this paper
proposes a novel kNN-based supervised hashing method,
which learns hash functions by directly maximizing the kNN
accuracy of the Hamming-embedded training data. To make
it scalable well to large problem, we propose a factorized
neighborhood representation to parsimoniously model the
neighborhood relationships inherent in training data. Considering that real-world data are often linearly inseparable,
we further kernelize this basic model to improve its performance. As a result, the proposed method is able to learn
accurate hashing functions with tolerable computation and
storage cost. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p>
