  <p><p>Important graph mining problems such as Clustering are computationally
demanding. To significantly accelerate these problems, we propose ProbGraph: a
graph representation that enables simple and fast approximate parallel graph
mining with strong theoretical guarantees on work, depth, and result accuracy.
The key idea is to represent sets of vertices using probabilistic set
representations such as Bloom filters. These representations are much faster to
process than the original vertex sets thanks to vectorizability and small size.
We use these representations as building blocks in important parallel graph
mining algorithms such as Clique Counting or Clustering. When enhanced with
ProbGraph, these algorithms significantly outperform tuned parallel exact
baselines (up to nearly 50x on 32 cores) while ensuring accuracy of more than
90% for many input graph datasets. Our novel bounds and algorithms based on
probabilistic set representations with desirable statistical properties are of
separate interest for the data analytics community.</p>
