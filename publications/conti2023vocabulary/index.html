  <p><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models have revolutionized the image
classification paradigm. Despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, a
pre-defined set of categories, a.k.a. the vocabulary, is assumed at test time
for composing the textual prompts. However, such assumption can be impractical
when the semantic context is unknown and evolving. We thus formalize a novel
task, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim to
assign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrained
language-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a known
vocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large,
containing millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grained
categories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing this
semantic space by means of an external vision-language database is the most
effective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying the
image. We then propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), a
method that exploits a pre-trained vision-language model and an external
vision-language database to address VIC in a training-free manner. CaSED first
extracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from the
database based on their semantic similarity to the image, and then assigns to
the image the best matching candidate category according to the same
vision-language model. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate that CaSED
outperforms other complex vision-language frameworks, while being efficient
with much fewer parameters, paving the way for future research in this
direction.</p>
