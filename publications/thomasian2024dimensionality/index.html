Reviewed is our effort on data clustering, dimensionality reduction via Singular Value Decomposition - SVD and indexing to build a smaller index and more efficient k-Nearest Neighbor - k-NN query processing for similarity search. k-NN queries based on scanning of the feature vectors of all images is obviously too costly for ever-increasing number of images. The ubiquitous multidimensional R-tree index and its extensions were not an option given their limited scalability dimension-wise. The cost of processing k-NN queries was further reduced by building memory resident Ordered Partition indices on dimensionality reduced clusters.
