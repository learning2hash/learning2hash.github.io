<meta name="description" content="Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) aiming at searching for a set of similar items to a given query image is a very important task in remote sensing applications. Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method has achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand various deep neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images. On the other hand the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database samples in a symmetric way. However with the number of database samples increasing it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of large-scale database images. In this paper we propose a novel deep hashing method named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL) for RSIR. The proposed AHCL generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In more detail the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the output of the network while the hash codes of database images are directly learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition we combine the semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network which improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
