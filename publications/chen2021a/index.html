In this paper, we theoretically propose a new hashing scheme to establish the sparse Fourier transform in high-dimensional space. The estimation of the algorithm complexity shows that this sparse Fourier transform can overcome the curse of dimensionality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time algorithm to recover the high-dimensional continuous frequencies.
