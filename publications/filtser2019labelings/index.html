<meta name="description" content="We investigate for which metric spaces the performance of distance labeling and of \(\ell_\infty\)-embeddings differ, and how significant can this difference be. Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of distances in a metric space \((X,d)\), where each point \(x\in X\) is assigned a succinct label, such that the distance between any two points \(x,y \in X\) can be approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an embedding into \(\ell_\infty\), where each point \(x\in X\) is assigned a vector \(f(x)\) such that \(|f(x)-f(y)|\infty\) is approximately \(d(x,y)\). The performance of a distance labeling or an \(\ell\infty\)-embedding is measured via its distortion and its label-size/dimension. We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these two measures. Here, a priority order \(\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) of the point set \(X\) is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a distance labeling has prioritized label-size \(\alpha(\cdot)\) if every \(x_j\) has label size at most \(\alpha(j)\). Similarly, an embedding \(f: X \to \ell_\infty\) has prioritized dimension \(\alpha(\cdot)\) if \(f(x_j)\) is non-zero only in the first \(\alpha(j)\) coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritized measures to their classical (worst-case) versions. We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly diverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have very similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge disparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict separation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally, when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the worst-case bound for label size often “translates” to a prioritized one, but also find a surprising exception to this rule." />

  <p><p>We investigate for which metric spaces the performance of distance labeling
and of \(\ell_\infty\)-embeddings differ, and how significant can this difference
be. Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of
distances in a metric space \((X,d)\), where each point \(x\in X\) is assigned a
succinct label, such that the distance between any two points \(x,y \in X\) can
be approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an
embedding into \(\ell_\infty\), where each point \(x\in X\) is assigned a vector
\(f(x)\) such that \(|f(x)-f(y)|<em>\infty\) is approximately \(d(x,y)\). The
performance of a distance labeling or an \(\ell</em>\infty\)-embedding is measured
via its distortion and its label-size/dimension.
  We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these
two measures. Here, a priority order \(\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) of the point set \(X\)
is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a
distance labeling has prioritized label-size \(\alpha(\cdot)\) if every \(x_j\) has
label size at most \(\alpha(j)\). Similarly, an embedding \(f: X \to \ell_\infty\)
has prioritized dimension \(\alpha(\cdot)\) if \(f(x_j)\) is non-zero only in the
first \(\alpha(j)\) coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritized
measures to their classical (worst-case) versions.
  We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly
diverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have
very similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge
disparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict
separation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,
when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the
worst-case bound for label size often “translates” to a prioritized one, but
also find a surprising exception to this rule.</p>
