<meta name="description" content="We investigate for which metric spaces the performance of distance labeling and of (\ell_\infty)-embeddings differ, and how significant can this difference be. Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of distances in a metric space ((X,d)), where each point (x\in X) is assigned a succinct label, such that the distance between any two points (x,y \in X) can be approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an embedding into (\ell_\infty), where each point (x\in X) is assigned a vector (f(x)) such that (|f(x)-f(y)|\infty) is approximately (d(x,y)). The performance of a distance labeling or an (\ell\infty)-embedding is measured via its distortion and its label-size/dimension. We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these two measures. Here, a priority order (\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)) of the point set (X) is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a distance labeling has prioritized label-size (\alpha(\cdot)) if every (x_j) has label size at most (\alpha(j)). Similarly, an embedding (f: X \to \ell_\infty) has prioritized dimension (\alpha(\cdot)) if (f(x_j)) is non-zero only in the first (\alpha(j)) coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritized measures to their classical (worst-case) versions. We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly diverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have very similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge disparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict separation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally, when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the worst-case bound for label size often “translates” to a prioritized one, but also find a surprising exception to this rule." />

  <p><p>We investigate for which metric spaces the performance of distance labeling
and of (\ell_\infty)-embeddings differ, and how significant can this difference
be. Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of
distances in a metric space ((X,d)), where each point (x\in X) is assigned a
succinct label, such that the distance between any two points (x,y \in X) can
be approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an
embedding into (\ell_\infty), where each point (x\in X) is assigned a vector
(f(x)) such that (|f(x)-f(y)|<em>\infty) is approximately (d(x,y)). The
performance of a distance labeling or an (\ell</em>\infty)-embedding is measured
via its distortion and its label-size/dimension.
  We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these
two measures. Here, a priority order (\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)) of the point set (X)
is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a
distance labeling has prioritized label-size (\alpha(\cdot)) if every (x_j) has
label size at most (\alpha(j)). Similarly, an embedding (f: X \to \ell_\infty)
has prioritized dimension (\alpha(\cdot)) if (f(x_j)) is non-zero only in the
first (\alpha(j)) coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritized
measures to their classical (worst-case) versions.
  We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly
diverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have
very similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge
disparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict
separation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,
when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the
worst-case bound for label size often “translates” to a prioritized one, but
also find a surprising exception to this rule.</p>
