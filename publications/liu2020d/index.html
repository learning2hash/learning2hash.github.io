<meta name="description" content="Recently, many detection methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed for image splicing forgery detection. Most of these detection methods focus on the local patches or local objects. In fact, image splicing forgery detection is a global binary classification task that distinguishes the tampered and non-tampered regions by image fingerprints. However, some specific image contents are hardly retained by CNN-based detection networks, but if included, would improve the detection accuracy of the networks. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel network called dual-encoder U-Net (D-Unet) for image splicing forgery detection, which employs an unfixed encoder and a fixed encoder. The unfixed encoder autonomously learns the image fingerprints that differentiate between the tampered and non-tampered regions, whereas the fixed encoder intentionally provides the direction information that assists the learning and detection of the network. This dual-encoder is followed by a spatial pyramid global-feature extraction module that expands the global insight of D-Unet for classifying the tampered and non-tampered regions more accurately. In an experimental comparison study of D-Unet and state-of-the-art methods, D-Unet outperformed the other methods in image-level and pixel-level detection, without requiring pre-training or training on a large number of forgery images. Moreover, it was stably robust to different attacks." />

  <p><p>Recently, many detection methods based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been proposed for image splicing forgery detection. Most of these
detection methods focus on the local patches or local objects. In fact, image
splicing forgery detection is a global binary classification task that
distinguishes the tampered and non-tampered regions by image fingerprints.
However, some specific image contents are hardly retained by CNN-based
detection networks, but if included, would improve the detection accuracy of
the networks. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel network called
dual-encoder U-Net (D-Unet) for image splicing forgery detection, which employs
an unfixed encoder and a fixed encoder. The unfixed encoder autonomously learns
the image fingerprints that differentiate between the tampered and non-tampered
regions, whereas the fixed encoder intentionally provides the direction
information that assists the learning and detection of the network. This
dual-encoder is followed by a spatial pyramid global-feature extraction module
that expands the global insight of D-Unet for classifying the tampered and
non-tampered regions more accurately. In an experimental comparison study of
D-Unet and state-of-the-art methods, D-Unet outperformed the other methods in
image-level and pixel-level detection, without requiring pre-training or
training on a large number of forgery images. Moreover, it was stably robust to
different attacks.</p>
