<meta name="description" content="This paper addresses the problem of very large-scale image retrieval, focusing on improving its accuracy and robustness. We target enhanced robustness of search to factors such as variations in illumination, object appearance and scale, partial occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds - particularly important when search is performed across very large datasets with significant variability. We propose a novel CNN-based global descriptor, called REMAP, which learns and aggregates a hierarchy of deep features from multiple CNN layers, and is trained end-to-end with a triplet loss. REMAP explicitly learns discriminative features which are mutually-supportive and complementary at various semantic levels of visual abstraction. These dense local features are max-pooled spatially at each layer, within multi-scale overlapping regions, before aggregation into a single image-level descriptor. To identify the semantically useful regions and layers for retrieval, we propose to measure the information gain of each region and layer using KL-divergence.

On image retrieval datasets Holidays, Oxford and MPEG, the REMAP descriptor achieves mAP of 95.5%, 91.5%, and 80.1% respectively, outperforming any results published to date.

  <p><p>This paper addresses the problem of very large-scale image retrieval,
focusing on improving its accuracy and robustness. We target enhanced
robustness of search to factors such as variations in illumination, object
appearance and scale, partial occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds -
particularly important when search is performed across very large datasets with
significant variability. We propose a novel CNN-based global descriptor, called
REMAP, which learns and aggregates a hierarchy of deep features from multiple
CNN layers, and is trained end-to-end with a triplet loss. REMAP explicitly
learns discriminative features which are mutually-supportive and complementary
at various semantic levels of visual abstraction. These dense local features
are max-pooled spatially at each layer, within multi-scale overlapping regions,
before aggregation into a single image-level descriptor. To identify the
semantically useful regions and layers for retrieval, we propose to measure the
information gain of each region and layer using KL-divergence. Our system
effectively learns during training how useful various regions and layers are
and weights them accordingly. We show that such relative entropy-guided
aggregation outperforms classical CNN-based aggregation controlled by SGD. The
entire framework is trained in an end-to-end fashion, outperforming the latest
state-of-the-art results. On image retrieval datasets Holidays, Oxford and
MPEG, the REMAP descriptor achieves mAP of 95.5%, 91.5%, and 80.1%
respectively, outperforming any results published to date. REMAP also formed
the core of the winning submission to the Google Landmark Retrieval Challenge
on Kaggle.</p>
