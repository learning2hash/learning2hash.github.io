  <p><p>The min-max kernel is a generalization of the popular resemblance kernel
(which is designed for binary data). In this paper, we demonstrate, through an
extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel
often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. As the
min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial
applications with massive data, we show that the min-max kernel can be
linearized via hashing techniques. This allows practitioners to apply min-max
kernel to large-scale applications using well matured linear algorithms such as
linear SVM or logistic regression.
  The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces
samples in the form of (\(i^<em>, t^</em>\)) where the \(i^<em>\) records the location (and
in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by
classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the \(t^</em>\) is theoretically
unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for
building large-scale linear classifiers. In this paper, we provide a simple
solution by discarding \(t^*\) (which we refer to as the “0-bit” scheme). Via an
extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose
essential information. We then apply the “0-bit” CWS for building linear
classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated
on a wide range of publicly available classification datasets. We expect this
work will generate interests among data mining practitioners who would like to
efficiently utilize the nonlinear information of non-binary and nonnegative
data.</p>
