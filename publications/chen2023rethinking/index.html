<meta name="description" content="Image-text retrieval, as a fundamental and important branch of information retrieval, has attracted extensive research attentions. The main challenge of this task is cross-modal semantic understanding and matching. Some recent works focus more on fine-grained cross-modal semantic matching. With the prevalence of large scale multimodal pretraining models, several state-of-the-art models (e.g. X-VLM) have achieved near-perfect performance on widely-used image-text retrieval benchmarks, i.e. MSCOCO-Test-5K and Flickr30K-Test-1K. In this paper, we review the two common benchmarks and observe that they are insufficient to assess the true capability of models on fine-grained cross-modal semantic matching. The reason is that a large amount of images and texts in the benchmarks are coarse-grained. Based on the observation, we renovate the coarse-grained images and texts in the old benchmarks and establish the improved benchmarks called MSCOCO-FG and Flickr30K-FG. Specifically, on the image side, we enlarge the original image pool by adopting more similar images. On the text side, we propose a novel semi-automatic renovation approach to refine coarse-grained sentences into finer-grained ones with little human effort. Furthermore, we evaluate representative image-text retrieval models on our new benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We also analyze the capability of models on fine-grained semantic comprehension through extensive experiments. The results show that even the state-of-the-art models have much room for improvement in fine-grained semantic understanding, especially in distinguishing attributes of close objects in images. Our code and improved benchmark datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/cwj1412/MSCOCO-Flikcr30K_FG, which we hope will inspire further in-depth research on cross-modal retrieval." />

  <p><p>Image-text retrieval, as a fundamental and important branch of information
retrieval, has attracted extensive research attentions. The main challenge of
this task is cross-modal semantic understanding and matching. Some recent works
focus more on fine-grained cross-modal semantic matching. With the prevalence
of large scale multimodal pretraining models, several state-of-the-art models
(e.g. X-VLM) have achieved near-perfect performance on widely-used image-text
retrieval benchmarks, i.e. MSCOCO-Test-5K and Flickr30K-Test-1K. In this paper,
we review the two common benchmarks and observe that they are insufficient to
assess the true capability of models on fine-grained cross-modal semantic
matching. The reason is that a large amount of images and texts in the
benchmarks are coarse-grained. Based on the observation, we renovate the
coarse-grained images and texts in the old benchmarks and establish the
improved benchmarks called MSCOCO-FG and Flickr30K-FG. Specifically, on the
image side, we enlarge the original image pool by adopting more similar images.
On the text side, we propose a novel semi-automatic renovation approach to
refine coarse-grained sentences into finer-grained ones with little human
effort. Furthermore, we evaluate representative image-text retrieval models on
our new benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We also
analyze the capability of models on fine-grained semantic comprehension through
extensive experiments. The results show that even the state-of-the-art models
have much room for improvement in fine-grained semantic understanding,
especially in distinguishing attributes of close objects in images. Our code
and improved benchmark datasets are publicly available at:
https://github.com/cwj1412/MSCOCO-Flikcr30K_FG, which we hope will inspire
further in-depth research on cross-modal retrieval.</p>
