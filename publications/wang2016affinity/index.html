      <p><p>Hashing techniques are powerful for approximate nearest
neighbour (ANN) search. Existing quantization methods in
hashing are all focused on scalar quantization (SQ) which
is inferior in utilizing the inherent data distribution. In this
paper, we propose a novel vector quantization (VQ) method
named affinity preserving quantization (APQ) to improve the
quantization quality of projection values, which has significantly
boosted the performance of state-of-the-art hashing
techniques. In particular, our method incorporates the neighbourhood
structure in the pre- and post-projection data space
into vector quantization. APQ minimizes the quantization errors
of projection values as well as the loss of affinity property
of original space. An effective algorithm has been proposed
to solve the joint optimization problem in APQ, and
the extension to larger binary codes has been resolved by applying
product quantization to APQ. Extensive experiments
have shown that APQ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
quantization methods, and has significantly improved
the performance of various hashing techniques.</p>
