<meta name="description" content="Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani (STOC 98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the c-approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level, an LSH family hashes &quot;nearby&quot; points to the same bucket and &quot;far away&quot; points to different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent, which helps determine both query time and space usage. In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS 06) constructed an LSH family based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of 1/c^2 for the l_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor and Panigrahy (SIDMA 07) and O&#39;Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT 14). Although optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally expensive.

  <p><p>Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani (STOC
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the c-approximate nearest
neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level, an LSH
family hashes "nearby" points to the same bucket and "far away" points to
different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent,
which helps determine both query time and space usage.
  In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS </code>06) constructed an LSH family
based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of
1/c^2 for the l_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor
and Panigrahy (SIDMA <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">07) and O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT </code>14). Although
optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally
expensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more
practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational
results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical
analysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the
exponent of lattice based LSH.
  In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices
achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c^2 using techniques from the geometry
of numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space
partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which
additional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low
space and query complexity, remains an important open problem.</p>
