<title>Bottom-k and Priority Sampling Set Similarity and Subset Sums with Minimal Independence | Awesome Learning to Hash</title>

<meta name="description" content="We consider bottom-k sampling for a set X picking a sample S_k(X) consisting of the k elements that are smallest according to a given hash function h. With this sample we can estimate the relative size f=Y/X of any subset Y as S_k(X) intersect Y/k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard similarity f=A intersect B/A union B between sets A and B. Given the bottom-k samples from A and B we construct the bottom-k sample of their union as S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)) and then the similarity is estimated as S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)/k. We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent the expected relative error is O(1/sqrt(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a constant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing. For comparison consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k hash independent functions h_1…h_k storing the smallest element with each hash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant independence and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently Feigenblat et al. showed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent and k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our result is based on a simply union bound transferring generic concentration bounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample e.g. getting stronger probability error bounds with higher independence. For weighted sets we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to the concrete input weights e.g. benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input. This time the analysis is much more involved but again we show that generic concentration bounds can be applied." />

  <p><p>We consider bottom-k sampling for a set X picking a sample S_k(X) consisting of the k elements that are smallest according to a given hash function h. With this sample we can estimate the relative size f=Y/X of any subset Y as S_k(X) intersect Y/k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard similarity f=A intersect B/A union B between sets A and B. Given the bottom-k samples from A and B we construct the bottom-k sample of their union as S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)) and then the similarity is estimated as S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)/k. We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent the expected relative error is O(1/sqrt(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a constant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing. For comparison consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k hash independent functions h_1…h_k storing the smallest element with each hash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant independence and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently Feigenblat et al. showed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent and k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our result is based on a simply union bound transferring generic concentration bounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample e.g. getting stronger probability error bounds with higher independence. For weighted sets we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to the concrete input weights e.g. benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input. This time the analysis is much more involved but again we show that generic concentration bounds can be applied.</p>
