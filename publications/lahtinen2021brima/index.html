Even though several widely used tools exist and the tools’ landscape evolved considerably, most of the tools still require intricate technical setups and high levels of technical savviness from its operators and crowdsource contributors. In order to address such challenges, we develop and present BRIMA – a flexible and open-source browser extension that allows BRowser-only IMage Annotation at considerably lower overheads. Once added to the browser, it instantly allows the user to annotate images easily and efficiently directly from the browser without any installation or setup on the client-side.
