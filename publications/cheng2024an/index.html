<meta name="description" content="Recommender systems (RS) have achieved significant success by leveraging explicit identification (ID) features. However, the full potential of content features, especially the pure image pixel features, remains relatively unexplored. The limited availability of large, diverse, and content-driven image recommendation datasets has hindered the use of raw images as item representations. In this regard, we present PixelRec, a massive image-centric recommendation dataset that includes approximately 200 million user-image interactions, 30 million users, and 400,000 high-quality cover images. By providing direct access to raw image pixels, PixelRec enables recommendation models to learn item representation directly from them. To demonstrate its utility, we begin by presenting the results of several classical pure ID-based baseline models, termed IDNet, trained on PixelRec. Then, to show the effectiveness of the dataset’s image features, we substitute the itemID embeddings (from IDNet) with a powerful vision encoder that represents items using their raw image pixels. This new model is dubbed PixelNet.Our findings indicate that even in standard, non-cold start recommendation settings where IDNet is recognized as highly effective, PixelNet can already perform equally well or even better than IDNet. Moreover, PixelNet has several other notable advantages over IDNet, such as being more effective in cold-start and cross-domain recommendation scenarios. These results underscore the importance of visual features in PixelRec. We believe that PixelRec can serve as a critical resource and testing ground for research on recommendation models that emphasize image pixel content. The dataset, code, and leaderboard will be available at https://github.com/westlake-repl/PixelRec." />
