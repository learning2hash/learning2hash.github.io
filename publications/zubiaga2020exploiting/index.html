While they are built out of external collections, they are unaware of the distributional characteristics of words in the classification dataset at hand, including most importantly the distribution of words across classes in training data. To make the most of these embeddings as features and to boost the performance of classifiers using them, we introduce a weighting scheme, Term Frequency-Category Ratio (TF-CR), which can weight high-frequency, category-exclusive words higher when computing word embeddings.

  <p><p>Text classification is one of the most frequent tasks for processing textual
data, facilitating among others research from large-scale datasets. Embeddings
of different kinds have recently become the de facto standard as features used
for text classification. These embeddings have the capacity to capture meanings
of words inferred from occurrences in large external collections. While they
are built out of external collections, they are unaware of the distributional
characteristics of words in the classification dataset at hand, including most
importantly the distribution of words across classes in training data. To make
the most of these embeddings as features and to boost the performance of
classifiers using them, we introduce a weighting scheme, Term
Frequency-Category Ratio (TF-CR), which can weight high-frequency,
category-exclusive words higher when computing word embeddings. Our experiments
on eight datasets show the effectiveness of TF-CR, leading to improved
performance scores over the well-known weighting schemes TF-IDF and KLD as well
as over the absence of a weighting scheme in most cases.</p>
