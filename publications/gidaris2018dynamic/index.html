<meta name="description" content="The human visual system has the remarkably ability to be able to effortlessly learn novel concepts from only a few examples. Mimicking the same behavior on machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine similarity function between feature representations and classification weight vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on “unseen” categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition (i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack. Finally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of Bharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results. The code and models of our paper will be published on: https://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting" />

  <p><p>The human visual system has the remarkably ability to be able to effortlessly
learn novel concepts from only a few examples. Mimicking the same behavior on
machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research
problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In
this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning
system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel
categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not
forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base
categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object
recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight
generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine
similarity function between feature representations and classification weight
vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base
categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on
“unseen” categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet
where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition
(i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings
respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the
base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack.
Finally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of
Bharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results. The
code and models of our paper will be published on:
