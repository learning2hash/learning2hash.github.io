<meta name="description" content="Person re identification is a challenging retrieval task that requires matching a person’s acquired image across non overlapping camera views. In this paper we propose an effective approach that incorporates both the fine and coarse pose information of the person to learn a discriminative embedding. In contrast to the recent direction of explicitly modeling body parts or correcting for misalignment based on these, we show that a rather straightforward inclusion of acquired camera view and/or the detected joint locations into a convolutional neural network helps to learn a very effective representation. To increase retrieval performance, re-ranking techniques based on computed distances have recently gained much attention. We propose a new unsupervised and automatic re-ranking framework that achieves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance. We show that in contrast to the current state-of-the-art re-ranking methods our approach does not require to compute new rank lists for each image pair (e.g., based on reciprocal neighbors) and performs well by using simple direct rank list based comparison or even by just using the already computed euclidean distances between the images. We show that both our learned representation and our re-ranking method achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of challenging surveillance image and video datasets.

  <p><p>Person re identification is a challenging retrieval task that requires
matching a person’s acquired image across non overlapping camera views. In this
paper we propose an effective approach that incorporates both the fine and
coarse pose information of the person to learn a discriminative embedding. In
contrast to the recent direction of explicitly modeling body parts or
correcting for misalignment based on these, we show that a rather
straightforward inclusion of acquired camera view and/or the detected joint
locations into a convolutional neural network helps to learn a very effective
representation. To increase retrieval performance, re-ranking techniques based
on computed distances have recently gained much attention. We propose a new
unsupervised and automatic re-ranking framework that achieves state-of-the-art
re-ranking performance. We show that in contrast to the current
state-of-the-art re-ranking methods our approach does not require to compute
new rank lists for each image pair (e.g., based on reciprocal neighbors) and
performs well by using simple direct rank list based comparison or even by just
using the already computed euclidean distances between the images. We show that
both our learned representation and our re-ranking method achieve
state-of-the-art performance on a number of challenging surveillance image and
video datasets.
