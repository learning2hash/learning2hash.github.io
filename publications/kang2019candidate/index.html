  <p><p>Generating the Top-N recommendations from a large corpus is computationally
expensive to perform at scale. Candidate generation and re-ranking based
approaches are often adopted in industrial settings to alleviate efficiency
problems. However it remains to be fully studied how well such schemes
approximate complete rankings (or how many candidates are required to achieve a
good approximation), or to develop systematic approaches to generate
high-quality candidates efficiently. In this paper, we seek to investigate
these questions via proposing a candidate generation and re-ranking based
framework (CIGAR), which first learns a preference-preserving binary embedding
for building a hash table to retrieve candidates, and then learns to re-rank
the candidates using real-valued ranking models with a candidate-oriented
objective. We perform a comprehensive study on several large-scale real-world
datasets consisting of millions of users/items and hundreds of millions of
interactions. Our results show that CIGAR significantly boosts the Top-N
accuracy against state-of-the-art recommendation models, while reducing the
query time by orders of magnitude. We hope that this work could draw more
attention to the candidate generation problem in recommender systems.</p>
