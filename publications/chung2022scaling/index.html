In this industry talk at ECIR 2022, we illustrate how we approach the main challenges from large scale cross-domain content-based image retrieval using a cascade method and a combination of our visual search and classification capabilities. Specifically, we present a system that is able to handle the scale of the data for e-commerce usage and the cross-domain nature of the query and gallery image pools. We showcase the approach applied in real-world e-commerce snap and search use case and its impact on ranking and latency performance.
