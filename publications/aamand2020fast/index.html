<meta name="description" content="Previous work on tabulation hashing by Patrascu and Thorup from STOC’11 on simple tabulation and from SODA’13 on twisted tabulation offered Chernoff-style concentration bounds on hash based sums, e.g., the number of balls/keys hashing to a given bin, but under some quite severe restrictions on the expected values of these sums. The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as consisting of (c=O(1)) characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as (c=8) characters of 8-bits. The character domain (\Sigma) should be small enough that character tables of size (|\Sigma|) fit in fast cache. The schemes then use (O(1)) tables of this size, so the space of tabulation hashing is (O(|\Sigma|)). However, the concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are (\ll |\Sigma|). To see the problem, consider the very simple case where we use tabulation hashing to throw (n) balls into (m) bins and want to analyse the number of balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds, we are fine if (n=m), for then the expected value is (1). However, if (m=2), as when tossing (n) unbiased coins, the expected value (n/2) is (\gg |\Sigma|) for large data sets, e.g., data sets that do not fit in fast cache. To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space, we need a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation, plus a new tabulation technique that we call tabulation-permutation hashing which is at most twice as slow as simple tabulation. No other hashing scheme of comparable speed offers similar Chernoff-style concentration bounds." />

  <p><p>Previous work on tabulation hashing by Patrascu and Thorup from STOC’11 on
simple tabulation and from SODA’13 on twisted tabulation offered Chernoff-style
concentration bounds on hash based sums, e.g., the number of balls/keys hashing
to a given bin, but under some quite severe restrictions on the expected values
of these sums. The basic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as
consisting of (c=O(1)) characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as (c=8) characters of
8-bits. The character domain (\Sigma) should be small enough that character
tables of size (|\Sigma|) fit in fast cache. The schemes then use (O(1)) tables
of this size, so the space of tabulation hashing is (O(|\Sigma|)). However, the
concentration bounds by Patrascu and Thorup only apply if the expected sums are
(\ll |\Sigma|).
  To see the problem, consider the very simple case where we use tabulation
hashing to throw (n) balls into (m) bins and want to analyse the number of
balls in a given bin. With their concentration bounds, we are fine if (n=m),
for then the expected value is (1). However, if (m=2), as when tossing (n)
unbiased coins, the expected value (n/2) is (\gg |\Sigma|) for large data sets,
e.g., data sets that do not fit in fast cache.
  To handle expectations that go beyond the limits of our small space, we need
a much more advanced analysis of simple tabulation, plus a new tabulation
technique that we call <em>tabulation-permutation</em> hashing which is at most
twice as slow as simple tabulation. No other hashing scheme of comparable speed
offers similar Chernoff-style concentration bounds.</p>
