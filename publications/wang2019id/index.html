<meta name="description" content="Set-based person re-identification (SReID) is a matching problem that aims to verify whether two sets are of the same identity (ID). Existing SReID models typically generate a feature representation per image and aggregate them to represent the set as a single embedding. However, they can easily be perturbed by noises–perceptually/semantically low quality images–which are inevitable due to imperfect tracking/detection systems, or overfit to trivial images. In this work, we present a novel and simple solution to this problem based on ID-aware quality that measures the perceptual and semantic quality of images guided by their ID information. Specifically, we propose an ID-aware Embedding that consists of two key components: (1) Feature learning attention that aims to learn robust image embeddings by focusing on ‘medium’ hard images. This way it can prevent overfitting to trivial images, and alleviate the influence of outliers. (2) Feature fusion attention is to fuse image embeddings in the set to obtain the set-level embedding. It ignores noisy information and pays more attention to discriminative images to aggregate more discriminative information. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches despite the simplicity of our approach." />

  <p><p>Set-based person re-identification (SReID) is a matching problem that aims to
verify whether two sets are of the same identity (ID). Existing SReID models
typically generate a feature representation per image and aggregate them to
represent the set as a single embedding. However, they can easily be perturbed
by noises–perceptually/semantically low quality images–which are inevitable
due to imperfect tracking/detection systems, or overfit to trivial images. In
this work, we present a novel and simple solution to this problem based on
ID-aware quality that measures the perceptual and semantic quality of images
guided by their ID information. Specifically, we propose an ID-aware Embedding
that consists of two key components: (1) Feature learning attention that aims
to learn robust image embeddings by focusing on ‘medium’ hard images. This way
it can prevent overfitting to trivial images, and alleviate the influence of
outliers. (2) Feature fusion attention is to fuse image embeddings in the set
to obtain the set-level embedding. It ignores noisy information and pays more
attention to discriminative images to aggregate more discriminative
information. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches despite the simplicity of our approach.</p>
