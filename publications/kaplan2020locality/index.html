<meta name="description" content="Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is an effective method to index a set of points such that we can efficiently find the nearest neighbors of a query point. We extend this method to our novel Set-query LSH (SLSH) such that it can find the nearest neighbors of a set of points given as a query. Let s(xy) be the similarity between two points x and y . We define a similarity between a set Q and a point x by aggregating the similarities s(px) for all pin Q . For example we can take s(px) to be the angular similarity between p and x (i.e. 1-angle (xp)/pi) and aggregate by arithmetic or geometric averaging or taking the lowest similarity. We develop locality sensitive hash families and data structures for a large set of such arithmetic and geometric averaging similarities and analyze their collision probabilities. We also establish an analogous framework and hash families for distance functions. Specifically we give a structure for the euclidean distance aggregated by either averaging or taking the maximum. We leverage SLSH to solve a geometric extension of the approximate near neighbors problem. In this version we consider a metric for which the unit ball is an ellipsoid and its orientation is specified with the query. An important application that motivates our work is group recommendation systems. Such a system embeds movies and users in the same feature space and the task of recommending a movie for a group to watch together translates to a set-query Q using an appropriate similarity." />
