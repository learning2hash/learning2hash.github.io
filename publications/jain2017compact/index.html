<meta name="description" content="Robust visual place recognition (VPR) requires scene representations that are invariant to various environmental challenges such as seasonal changes and variations due to ambient lighting conditions during day and night. Moreover, a practical VPR system necessitates compact representations of environmental features. To satisfy these requirements, in this paper we suggest a modification to the existing pipeline of VPR systems to incorporate supervised hashing. The modified system learns (in a supervised setting) compact binary codes from image feature descriptors. These binary codes imbibe robustness to the visual variations exposed to it during the training phase, thereby, making the system adaptive to severe environmental changes. Also, incorporating supervised hashing makes VPR computationally more efficient and easy to implement on simple hardware. This is because binary embeddings can be learned over simple-to-compute features and the distance computation is also in the low-dimensional hamming space of binary codes. We have performed experiments on several challenging data sets covering seasonal, illumination and viewpoint variations. We also compare two widely used supervised hashing methods of CCAITQ and MLH and show that this new pipeline out-performs or closely matches the state-of-the-art deep learning VPR methods that are based on high-dimensional features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks." />
