  <p><p>Previous work has shown that feature maps of deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) can be interpreted as feature representation of a particular
image region. Features aggregated from these feature maps have been exploited
for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in recent
years. The key to the success of such methods is the feature representation.
However, the different factors that impact the effectiveness of features are
still not explored thoroughly. There are much less discussion about the best
combination of them.
  The main contribution of our paper is the thorough evaluations of the various
factors that affect the discriminative ability of the features extracted from
CNNs. Based on the evaluation results, we also identify the best choices for
different factors and propose a new multi-scale image feature representation
method to encode the image effectively. Finally, we show that the proposed
method generalises well and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four
typical datasets used for visual instance retrieval.</p>
