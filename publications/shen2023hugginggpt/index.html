While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding generation interaction and reasoning we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy we present HuggingGPT an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g. Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks.
