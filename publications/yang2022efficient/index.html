<meta name="description" content="Similarity search over a bipartite graph aims to retrieve from the graph the nodes that are similar to each other, which finds applications in various fields such as online advertising, recommender systems etc. Existing similarity measures either (i) overlook the unique properties of bipartite graphs, or (ii) fail to capture high-order information between nodes accurately, leading to suboptimal result quality. Recently, Hidden Personalized PageRank (HPP) is applied to this problem and found to be more effective compared with prior similarity measures. However, existing solutions for HPP computation incur significant computational costs, rendering it inefficient especially on large graphs. In this paper, we first identify an inherent drawback of HPP and overcome it by proposing bidirectional HPP (BHPP). Then, we formulate similarity search over bipartite graphs as the problem of approximate BHPP computation, and present an efficient solution Approx-BHPP. Specifically, Approx-BHPP offers rigorous theoretical accuracy guarantees with optimal computational complexity by combining deterministic graph traversal with matrix operations in an optimized and non-trivial way. Moreover, our solution achieves significant gain in practical efficiency due to several carefully-designed optimizations. Extensive experiments, comparing BHPP against 8 existing similarity measures over 7 real bipartite graphs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPP on query rewriting and item recommendation. Moreover, Approx-BHPP outperforms baseline solutions often by up to orders of magnitude in terms of computational time on both small and large datasets." />

  <p><p>Similarity search over a bipartite graph aims to retrieve from the graph the
nodes that are similar to each other, which finds applications in various
fields such as online advertising, recommender systems etc. Existing similarity
measures either (i) overlook the unique properties of bipartite graphs, or (ii)
fail to capture high-order information between nodes accurately, leading to
suboptimal result quality. Recently, Hidden Personalized PageRank (HPP) is
applied to this problem and found to be more effective compared with prior
similarity measures. However, existing solutions for HPP computation incur
significant computational costs, rendering it inefficient especially on large
graphs.
  In this paper, we first identify an inherent drawback of HPP and overcome it
by proposing bidirectional HPP (BHPP). Then, we formulate similarity search
over bipartite graphs as the problem of approximate BHPP computation, and
present an efficient solution Approx-BHPP. Specifically, Approx-BHPP offers
rigorous theoretical accuracy guarantees with optimal computational complexity
by combining deterministic graph traversal with matrix operations in an
optimized and non-trivial way. Moreover, our solution achieves significant gain
in practical efficiency due to several carefully-designed optimizations.
Extensive experiments, comparing BHPP against 8 existing similarity measures
over 7 real bipartite graphs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPP on query
rewriting and item recommendation. Moreover, Approx-BHPP outperforms baseline
solutions often by up to orders of magnitude in terms of computational time on
both small and large datasets.</p>
