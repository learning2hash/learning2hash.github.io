  <p><p>This paper is concerned with practical implementations of approximate string
dictionaries that allow edit errors. In this problem, we have as input a
dictionary \(D\) of \(d\) strings of total length \(n\) over an alphabet of size
\(\sigma\). Given a bound \(k\) and a pattern \(x\) of length \(m\), a query has to
return all the strings of the dictionary which are at edit distance at most \(k\)
from \(x\), where the edit distance between two strings \(x\) and \(y\) is defined as
the minimum-cost sequence of edit operations that transform \(x\) into \(y\). The
cost of a sequence of operations is defined as the sum of the costs of the
operations involved in the sequence. In this paper, we assume that each of
these operations has unit cost and consider only three operations: deletion of
one character, insertion of one character and substitution of a character by
another. We present a practical implementation of the data structure we
recently proposed and which works only for one error. We extend the scheme to
\(2\leq k&lt;m\). Our implementation has many desirable properties: it has a very
fast and space-efficient building algorithm. The dictionary data structure is
compact and has fast and robust query time. Finally our data structure is
simple to implement as it only uses basic techniques from the literature,
mainly hashing (linear probing and hash signatures) and succinct data
structures (bitvectors supporting rank queries).</p>
