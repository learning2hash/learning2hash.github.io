In this paper we address an approach complementary to indexing in order to improve the runtimes of retrieval by querying only the most promising keypoint descriptors as this affects matching runtimes linearly and can therefore lead to increased efficiency. As this reduction of kNN queries reduces the number of tentative correspondences a loss of query precision is minimized by an additional image-level correspondence generation stage with a computational performance independent of the underlying indexing structure.

Our results suggest that decreasing the number of queried descriptors does not necessarily imply a reduction in the result quality as long as alternative ways of increasing query recall (by thoroughly selecting k) and MAP (using image-level correspondence generation) are considered." />
