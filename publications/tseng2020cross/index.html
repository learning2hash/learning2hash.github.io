<meta name="description" content="Few-shot classification aims to recognize novel categories with only few labeled images in each class. Existing metric-based few-shot classification algorithms predict categories by comparing the feature embeddings of query images with those from a few labeled images (support examples) using a learned metric function. While promising performance has been demonstrated, these methods often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to large discrepancy of the feature distribution across domains. In this work, we address the problem of few-shot classification under domain shifts for metric-based methods. Our core idea is to use feature-wise transformation layers for augmenting the image features using affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions under different domains in the training stage. To capture variations of the feature distributions under different domains, we further apply a learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters of the feature-wise transformation layers. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies under the domain generalization setting using five few-shot classification datasets: mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature-wise transformation layer is applicable to various metric-based models, and provides consistent improvements on the few-shot classification performance under domain shift." />

  <p><p>Few-shot classification aims to recognize novel categories with only few
labeled images in each class. Existing metric-based few-shot classification
algorithms predict categories by comparing the feature embeddings of query
images with those from a few labeled images (support examples) using a learned
metric function. While promising performance has been demonstrated, these
methods often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to large discrepancy of
the feature distribution across domains. In this work, we address the problem
of few-shot classification under domain shifts for metric-based methods. Our
core idea is to use feature-wise transformation layers for augmenting the image
features using affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions
under different domains in the training stage. To capture variations of the
feature distributions under different domains, we further apply a
learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters of the
feature-wise transformation layers. We conduct extensive experiments and
ablation studies under the domain generalization setting using five few-shot
classification datasets: mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature-wise transformation
layer is applicable to various metric-based models, and provides consistent
improvements on the few-shot classification performance under domain shift.</p>
