<meta name="description" content="In recent years, binary coding techniques are becoming increasingly popular because of their high efficiency in handling large-scale computer vision applications. It has been demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that leverage supervised information can significantly enhance the coding quality, and hence greatly benefit visual search tasks. Typically, a modern binary coding method seeks to learn a group of coding functions which compress data samples into binary codes. However, few methods pursued the coding functions such that the precision at the top of a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach, namely Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC), which explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train the disciplined coding functions, by which the mistakes at the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions, we relax the original discrete optimization objective with a continuous surrogate, and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost, we also design an online learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more efficiently. Empirical studies based upon three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed binary coding approach achieves superior image search accuracy over the state-of-the-arts." />

  <p><p>In recent years, binary coding techniques are becoming
increasingly popular because of their high efficiency in handling large-scale computer vision applications. It has been
demonstrated that supervised binary coding techniques that
leverage supervised information can significantly enhance
the coding quality, and hence greatly benefit visual search
tasks. Typically, a modern binary coding method seeks
to learn a group of coding functions which compress data
samples into binary codes. However, few methods pursued
the coding functions such that the precision at the top of
a ranking list according to Hamming distances of the generated binary codes is optimized.
In this paper, we propose a novel supervised binary coding approach, namely
Top Rank Supervised Binary Coding (Top-RSBC), which
explicitly focuses on optimizing the precision of top positions in a Hamming-distance ranking list towards preserving the supervision information. The core idea is to train
the disciplined coding functions, by which the mistakes at
the top of a Hamming-distance ranking list are penalized
more than those at the bottom. To solve such coding functions, we relax the original discrete optimization objective
with a continuous surrogate, and derive a stochastic gradient descent to optimize the surrogate objective. To further reduce the training time cost, we also design an online
learning algorithm to optimize the surrogate objective more
efficiently. Empirical studies based upon three benchmark
image datasets demonstrate that the proposed binary coding approach achieves superior image search accuracy over
the state-of-the-arts.</p>
