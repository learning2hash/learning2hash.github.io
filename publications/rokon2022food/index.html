<meta name="description" content="Food is essential for human survival, and people always try to taste different types of delicious recipes. Frequently, people choose food ingredients without even knowing their names or pick up some food ingredients that are not obvious to them from a grocery store. Knowing which ingredients can be mixed to make a delicious food recipe is essential. Selecting the right recipe by choosing a list of ingredients is very difficult for a beginner cook. However, it can be a problem even for experts. One such example is recognising objects through image processing. Although this process is complex due to different food ingredients, traditional approaches will lead to an inaccuracy rate. These problems can be solved by machine learning and deep learning approaches. In this paper, we implemented a model for food ingredients recognition and designed an algorithm for recommending recipes based on recognised ingredients. We made a custom dataset consisting of 9856 images belonging to 32 different food ingredients classes. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model was used to identify food ingredients, and for recipe recommendations, we have used machine learning. We achieved an accuracy of 94 percent, which is quite impressive." />
