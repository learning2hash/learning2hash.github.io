<meta name="description" content="Unsupervised image retrieval aims to learn an efficient retrieval system without expensive data annotations, but most existing methods rely heavily on handcrafted feature descriptors or pre-trained feature extractors. To minimize human supervision, recent advance proposes deep fully unsupervised image retrieval aiming at training a deep model from scratch to jointly optimize visual features and quantization codes. However, existing approach mainly focuses on instance contrastive learning without considering underlying semantic structure information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised consistent quantization approach to deep fully unsupervised image retrieval, which consists of part consistent quantization and global consistent quantization. In part consistent quantization, we devise part neighbor semantic consistency learning with codeword diversity regularization. This allows to discover underlying neighbor structure information of sub-quantized representations as self-supervision. In global consistent quantization, we employ contrastive learning for both embedding and quantized representations and fuses these representations for consistent contrastive regularization between instances. This can make up for the loss of useful representation information during quantization and regularize consistency between instances. With a unified learning objective of part and global consistent quantization, our approach exploits richer self-supervision cues to facilitate model learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods." />

  <p><p>Unsupervised image retrieval aims to learn an efficient retrieval system
without expensive data annotations, but most existing methods rely heavily on
handcrafted feature descriptors or pre-trained feature extractors. To minimize
human supervision, recent advance proposes deep fully unsupervised image
retrieval aiming at training a deep model from scratch to jointly optimize
visual features and quantization codes. However, existing approach mainly
focuses on instance contrastive learning without considering underlying
semantic structure information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this
work, we propose a novel self-supervised consistent quantization approach to
deep fully unsupervised image retrieval, which consists of part consistent
quantization and global consistent quantization. In part consistent
quantization, we devise part neighbor semantic consistency learning with
codeword diversity regularization. This allows to discover underlying neighbor
structure information of sub-quantized representations as self-supervision. In
global consistent quantization, we employ contrastive learning for both
embedding and quantized representations and fuses these representations for
consistent contrastive regularization between instances. This can make up for
the loss of useful representation information during quantization and
regularize consistency between instances. With a unified learning objective of
part and global consistent quantization, our approach exploits richer
self-supervision cues to facilitate model learning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets show the superiority of our approach over the
state-of-the-art methods.</p>
