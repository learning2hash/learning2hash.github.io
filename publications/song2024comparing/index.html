<meta name="description" content="A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving relevant candidates from a broad set using a fast bi-encoder (BE), followed by applying expensive but accurate cross-encoders (CE) to a limited candidate set. However, relying on this small subset is often susceptible to error propagation from the bi-encoders, which limits the overall performance. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework. CMC compares a query and multiple embeddings of similar candidates (i.e., neighbors) through shallow self-attention layers, delivering rich representations contextualized to each other. Furthermore, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously. For example, comparing ~10K candidates with CMC takes a similar amount of time as comparing 16 candidates with CE. Experimental results on the ZeSHEL dataset demonstrate that CMC, when plugged in between bi-encoders and cross-encoders as a seamless intermediate reranker (BE-CMC-CE), can effectively improve recall@k (+4.8%-p, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to using only bi-encoders (BE-CE), with negligible slowdown (&lt;7%). Additionally, to verify CMC’s effectiveness as the final-stage reranker in improving top-1 accuracy, we conduct experiments on downstream tasks such as entity, passage, and dialogue ranking. The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) but also often more effective than CE, with improved prediction accuracy in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p)." />

  <p><p>A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving relevant candidates
from a broad set using a fast bi-encoder (BE), followed by applying expensive
but accurate cross-encoders (CE) to a limited candidate set. However, relying
on this small subset is often susceptible to error propagation from the
bi-encoders, which limits the overall performance. To address these issues, we
propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework. CMC compares a query
and multiple embeddings of similar candidates (i.e., neighbors) through shallow
self-attention layers, delivering rich representations contextualized to each
other. Furthermore, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons
simultaneously. For example, comparing ~10K candidates with CMC takes a similar
amount of time as comparing 16 candidates with CE. Experimental results on the
ZeSHEL dataset demonstrate that CMC, when plugged in between bi-encoders and
cross-encoders as a seamless intermediate reranker (BE-CMC-CE), can effectively
improve recall@k (+4.8%-p, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to using only
bi-encoders (BE-CE), with negligible slowdown (&lt;7%). Additionally, to verify
CMC’s effectiveness as the final-stage reranker in improving top-1 accuracy, we
conduct experiments on downstream tasks such as entity, passage, and dialogue
ranking. The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) but also often
more effective than CE, with improved prediction accuracy in Wikipedia entity
linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).</p>
