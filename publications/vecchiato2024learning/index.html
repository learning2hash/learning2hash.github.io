  <p><p>Developing increasingly efficient and accurate algorithms for approximate
nearest neighbor search is a paramount goal in modern information retrieval. A
primary approach to addressing this question is clustering, which involves
partitioning the dataset into distinct groups, with each group characterized by
a representative data point. By this method, retrieving the top-k data points
for a query requires identifying the most relevant clusters based on their
