<meta name="description" content="Dense high dimensional vectors are becoming increasingly vital in fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs), serving as standard representations for multimodal data. Now the dimensionality of these vector can exceed several thousands easily. Despite the nearest neighbor search (NNS) over these dense high dimensional vectors have been widely used for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and many other applications, the effectiveness of NNS in such a high-dimensional space remains uncertain, given the possible challenge caused by the “curse of dimensionality.” To address above question, in this paper, we conduct extensive NNS studies with different distance functions, such as (L_1) distance, (L_2) distance and angular-distance, across diverse embedding datasets, of varied types, dimensionality and modality. Our aim is to investigate factors influencing the meaningfulness of NNS. Our experiments reveal that high-dimensional text embeddings exhibit increased resilience as dimensionality rises to higher levels when compared to random vectors. This resilience suggests that text embeddings are less affected to the “curse of dimensionality,” resulting in more meaningful NNS outcomes for practical use. Additionally, the choice of distance function has minimal impact on the relevance of NNS. Our study shows the effectiveness of the embedding-based data representation method and can offer opportunity for further optimization of dense vector-related applications." />

  <p><p>Dense high dimensional vectors are becoming increasingly vital in fields such
as computer vision, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs), serving
as standard representations for multimodal data. Now the dimensionality of
these vector can exceed several thousands easily. Despite the nearest neighbor
search (NNS) over these dense high dimensional vectors have been widely used
for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and many other applications, the
effectiveness of NNS in such a high-dimensional space remains uncertain, given
the possible challenge caused by the “curse of dimensionality.” To address
above question, in this paper, we conduct extensive NNS studies with different
distance functions, such as (L_1) distance, (L_2) distance and
angular-distance, across diverse embedding datasets, of varied types,
dimensionality and modality. Our aim is to investigate factors influencing the
meaningfulness of NNS. Our experiments reveal that high-dimensional text
embeddings exhibit increased resilience as dimensionality rises to higher
levels when compared to random vectors. This resilience suggests that text
embeddings are less affected to the “curse of dimensionality,” resulting in
more meaningful NNS outcomes for practical use. Additionally, the choice of
distance function has minimal impact on the relevance of NNS. Our study shows
the effectiveness of the embedding-based data representation method and can
offer opportunity for further optimization of dense vector-related
applications.</p>
