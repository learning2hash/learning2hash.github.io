<meta name="description" content="One of the main problems that emerges in the classic approach to semantics is the difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic annotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive diffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system, which information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions of users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually exploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a modern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible to generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically similar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures based on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING Distance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval, which collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two terms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a search engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel formal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of view underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear combination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance. The analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the web resources." />

  <p><p>One of the main problems that emerges in the classic approach to semantics is
the difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic
annotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive
diffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system,
which information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions
of users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually
exploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a
modern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible
to generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically
similar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures
based on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING
Distance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval,
which collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two
terms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a
search engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel
formal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of
view underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear
combination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance.
The analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the
web resources.</p>
