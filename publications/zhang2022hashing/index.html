  <p><p>Existing unsupervised hash learning is a kind of attribute-centered
calculation. It may not accurately preserve the similarity between data. This
leads to low down the performance of hash function learning. In this paper, a
hash algorithm is proposed with a hyper-class representation. It is a two-steps
approach. The first step finds potential decision features and establish
hyper-class. The second step constructs hash learning based on the hyper-class
information in the first step, so that the hash codes of the data within the
hyper-class are as similar as possible, as well as the hash codes of the data
between the hyper-classes are as different as possible. To evaluate the
efficiency, a series of experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The
experimental results show that the proposed hash algorithm is more efficient
than the compared algorithms, in terms of mean average precision (MAP), average
precision (AP) and Hamming radius 2 (HAM2)</p>
