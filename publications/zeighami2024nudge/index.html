<meta name="description" content="(k)-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ((k)-NN retrieval) from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of (k)-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE’s non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors." />

  <p><p>(k)-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ((k)-NN retrieval)
from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text
and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In
practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve
their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches
either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the
cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the
pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding
fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than
both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of
data records to maximize the accuracy of (k)-NN retrieval. We present a
thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE’s non-parametric approach.
We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained
variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure
that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to
the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five
pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE
runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing
fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase
in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the
pre-trained model and training adaptors.</p>
