  <p><p>A family of loss functions built on pair-based computation have been proposed
in the literature which provide a myriad of solutions for deep metric learning.
In this paper, we provide a general weighting framework for understanding
recent pair-based loss functions. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we
establish a General Pair Weighting (GPW) framework, which casts the sampling
problem of deep metric learning into a unified view of pair weighting through
gradient analysis, providing a powerful tool for understanding recent
pair-based loss functions; (2) we show that with GPW, various existing
pair-based methods can be compared and discussed comprehensively, with clear
differences and key limitations identified; (3) we propose a new loss called
multi-similarity loss (MS loss) under the GPW, which is implemented in two
iterative steps (i.e., mining and weighting). This allows it to fully consider
three similarities for pair weighting, providing a more principled approach for
collecting and weighting informative pairs. Finally, the proposed MS loss
obtains new state-of-the-art performance on four image retrieval benchmarks,
where it outperforms the most recent approaches, such as
ABE\cite{Kim_2018_ECCV} and HTL by a large margin: 60.6% to 65.7% on CUB200,
and 80.9% to 88.0% on In-Shop Clothes Retrieval dataset at Recall@1. Code is
