In this work, we investigate a new metric-learning method, Memory-Augmented Relation Network (MRN), to explicitly exploit these relationships. In particular, for an instance, we choose the samples that are visually similar from the working context, and perform weighted information propagation to attentively aggregate helpful information from the chosen ones to enhance its representation. In MRN, we also formulate the distance metric as a learnable relation module which learns to compare for similarity measurement, and augment the working context with memory slots, both contributing to its generality. We empirically demonstrate that MRN yields significant improvement over its ancestor and achieves competitive or even better performance when compared with other few-shot learning approaches on the two major benchmark datasets, i.e. miniImagenet and tieredImagenet." />

  <p><p>Metric-based few-shot learning methods concentrate on learning transferable
feature embedding that generalizes well from seen categories to unseen
categories under the supervision of limited number of labelled instances.
However, most of them treat each individual instance in the working context
separately without considering its relationships with the others. In this work,
we investigate a new metric-learning method, Memory-Augmented Relation Network
(MRN), to explicitly exploit these relationships. In particular, for an
instance, we choose the samples that are visually similar from the working
context, and perform weighted information propagation to attentively aggregate
helpful information from the chosen ones to enhance its representation. In MRN,
we also formulate the distance metric as a learnable relation module which
learns to compare for similarity measurement, and augment the working context
with memory slots, both contributing to its generality. We empirically
demonstrate that MRN yields significant improvement over its ancestor and
achieves competitive or even better performance when compared with other
few-shot learning approaches on the two major benchmark datasets, i.e.
miniImagenet and tieredImagenet.</p>
