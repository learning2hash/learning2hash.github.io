  <p><p>In this paper, given a small bag of images, each containing a common but
latent predicate, we are interested in localizing visual subject-object pairs
connected via the common predicate in each of the images. We refer to this
novel problem as visual relationship co-localization or VRC as an abbreviation.
VRC is a challenging task, even more so than the well-studied object
co-localization task. This becomes further challenging when using just a few
images, the model has to learn to co-localize visual subject-object pairs
connected via unseen predicates. To solve VRC, we propose an optimization
framework to select a common visual relationship in each image of the bag. The
goal of the optimization framework is to find the optimal solution by learning
visual relationship similarity across images in a few-shot setting. To obtain
robust visual relationship representation, we utilize a simple yet effective
technique that learns relationship embedding as a translation vector from
visual subject to visual object in a shared space. Further, to learn visual
relationship similarity, we utilize a proven meta-learning technique commonly
used for few-shot classification tasks. Finally, to tackle the combinatorial
complexity challenge arising from an exponential number of feasible solutions,
we use a greedy approximation inference algorithm that selects approximately
the best solution.
  We extensively evaluate our proposed framework on variations of bag sizes
obtained from two challenging public datasets, namely VrR-VG and VG-150, and
achieve impressive visual co-localization performance.</p>
