<meta name="description" content="Image classification is a longstanding problem in computer vision and machine learning research. Most recent works (e.g. SupCon , Triplet, and max-margin) mainly focus on grouping the intra-class samples aggressively and compactly, with the assumption that all intra-class samples should be pulled tightly towards their class centers. However, such an objective will be very hard to achieve since it ignores the intra-class variance in the dataset. (i.e. different instances from the same class can have significant differences). Thus, such a monotonous objective is not sufficient. To provide a more informative objective, we introduce Contrast Your Neighbours (CoNe) - a simple yet practical learning framework for supervised image classification. Specifically, in CoNe, each sample is not only supervised by its class center but also directly employs the features of its similar neighbors as anchors to generate more adaptive and refined targets. Moreover, to further boost the performance, we propose ``distributional consistency” as a more informative regularization to enable similar instances to have a similar probability distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across different benchmark datasets, network architectures, and settings. Notably, even without a complicated training recipe, our CoNe achieves 80.8% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, which surpasses the recent Timm training recipe (80.4%). Code and pre-trained models are available at \href{https://github.com/mingkai-zheng/CoNe}{https://github.com/mingkai-zheng/CoNe}." />

  <p><p>Image classification is a longstanding problem in computer vision and machine
learning research. Most recent works (e.g. SupCon , Triplet, and max-margin)
mainly focus on grouping the intra-class samples aggressively and compactly,
with the assumption that all intra-class samples should be pulled tightly
towards their class centers. However, such an objective will be very hard to
achieve since it ignores the intra-class variance in the dataset. (i.e.
different instances from the same class can have significant differences).
Thus, such a monotonous objective is not sufficient. To provide a more

yet practical learning framework for supervised image classification.
Specifically, in CoNe, each sample is not only supervised by its class center
but also directly employs the features of its similar neighbors as anchors to
