We put forth a new string matching algorithm which matches the pattern from neither the left nor the right end, instead a special position. Comparing with the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm, the new algorithm is more flexible to pick the position for starting comparisons. The option really brings it a saving in cost.
