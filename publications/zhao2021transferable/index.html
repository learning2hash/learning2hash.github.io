<meta name="description" content="With the development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely used in multimedia forensics for tasks such as detecting and identifying image forgeries. Meanwhile, anti-forensic attacks have been developed to fool these CNN-based forensic algorithms. Previous anti-forensic attacks often were designed to remove forgery traces left by a single manipulation operation as opposed to a set of manipulations. Additionally, recent research has shown that existing anti-forensic attacks against forensic CNNs have poor transferability, i.e. they are unable to fool other forensic CNNs that were not explicitly used during training. In this paper, we propose a new anti-forensic attack framework designed to remove forensic traces left by a variety of manipulation operations. This attack is transferable, i.e. it can be used to attack forensic CNNs are unknown to the attacker, and it introduces only minimal distortions that are imperceptible to human eyes. Our proposed attack utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to build a generator that can attack color images of any size. We achieve attack transferability through the use of a new training strategy and loss function. We conduct extensive experiment to demonstrate that our attack can fool many state-of-art forensic CNNs with varying levels of knowledge available to the attacker." />
