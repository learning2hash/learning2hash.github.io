We survey permutation-based methods for approximate k-nearest neighbor search. In these methods, every data point is represented by a ranked list of pivots sorted by the distance to this point. Such ranked lists are called permutations. The underpinning assumption is that, for both metric and non-metric spaces, the distance between permutations is a good proxy for the distance between original points. Thus, it should be possible to efficiently retrieve most true nearest neighbors by examining only a tiny subset of data points whose permutations are similar to the permutation of a query. We further test this assumption by carrying out an extensive experimental evaluation where permutation methods are pitted against state-of-the art benchmarks (the multi-probe LSH, the VP-tree, and proximity-graph based retrieval) on a variety of realistically large data set from the image and textual domain. The focus is on the high-accuracy retrieval methods for generic spaces. Additionally, we assume that both data and indices are stored in main memory. We find permutation methods to be reasonably efficient and describe a setup where these methods are most useful. To ease reproducibility, we make our software and data sets publicly available.
