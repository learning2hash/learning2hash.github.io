The main challenge is to map different modalities into a common semantic space, in which distance between concepts in different modalities can be well modeled. For cross-modal information retrieval between images and texts, existing work mostly uses off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction. For texts, word-level features such as bag-of-words or word2vec are employed to build deep learning models to represent texts. Besides word-level semantics, the semantic relations between words are also informative but less explored. In this paper, we model texts by graphs using similarity measure based on word2vec.

One path utilizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for text modeling based on graph representations.

  <p><p>Cross-modal information retrieval aims to find heterogeneous data of various
modalities from a given query of one modality. The main challenge is to map
different modalities into a common semantic space, in which distance between
concepts in different modalities can be well modeled. For cross-modal
information retrieval between images and texts, existing work mostly uses
off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction.
For texts, word-level features such as bag-of-words or word2vec are employed to
build deep learning models to represent texts. Besides word-level semantics,
the semantic relations between words are also informative but less explored. In
this paper, we model texts by graphs using similarity measure based on
word2vec. A dual-path neural network model is proposed for couple feature
learning in cross-modal information retrieval. One path utilizes Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) for text modeling based on graph representations.
The other path uses a neural network with layers of nonlinearities for image
modeling based on off-the-shelf features. The model is trained by a pairwise
similarity loss function to maximize the similarity of relevant text-image
pairs and minimize the similarity of irrelevant pairs. Experimental results
show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
significantly, with 17% improvement on accuracy for the best case.</p>
