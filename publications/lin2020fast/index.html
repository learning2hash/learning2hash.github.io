<meta name="description" content="Online image hashing has received increasing research attention recently which processes large-scale data in a streaming fashion to update the hash functions on-the-fly. To this end most existing works exploit this problem under a supervised setting i.e. using class labels to boost the hashing performance which suffers from the defects in both adaptivity and efficiency First large amounts of training batches are required to learn up-to-date hash functions which leads to poor online adaptivity. Second the training is time-consuming which contradicts with the core need of online learning. In this paper a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed Fast Class-wise Updating for Online Hashing (FCOH) is proposed to address the above two challenges by introducing a novel and efficient inner product operation. To achieve fast online adaptivity a class-wise updating method is developed to decompose the binary code learning and alternatively renew the hash functions in a class-wise fashion which well addresses the burden on large amounts of training batches. Quantitatively such a decomposition further leads to at least 75 storage saving. To further achieve online efficiency we propose a semi-relaxation optimization which accelerates the online training by treating different binary constraints independently. Without additional constraints and variables the time complexity is significantly reduced. Such a scheme is also quantitatively shown to well preserve past information during updating hashing functions. We have quantitatively demonstrated that the collective effort of class-wise updating and semi-relaxation optimization provides a superior performance comparing to various state-of-the-art methods which is verified through extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets." />
