<title>On The Problem Of p_1^-1 In Locality-sensitive Hashing | Awesome Learning to Hash</title>

<meta name="description" content="A Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH) function is called \((r,cr,p_1,p_2)\)-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than \(r\) collide with probability at least \(p_1\) while data points with a distance greater than \(cr\) collide with probability at most \(p_2\). These functions form the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest neighbour problems. In particular one may build a \(c\)-approximate nearest neighbour data structure with query time \(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1)\) where \(\rho=\frac{log1/p_1}{log1/p_2}\in(0,1)\). That is, sub-linear time, as long as \(p_1\) is not too small. This is significant since most high dimensional nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can’t be solved exact, faster than a brute force linear-time scan of the database. Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision probabilities, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\). Including the best functions for Cosine and Jaccard Similarity. This means that the \(n^\rho/p_1\) query time of LSH is often not sub-linear after all, even for approximate nearest neighbours! In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the query time of LSH to \(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1^{1-\rho})\) (and the space usage correspondingly.) Since \(n^\rho p_1^{\rho-1} &lt; n \Leftrightarrow p_1 &gt; n^{-1}\), our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision probabilities at least \(1/n\). For \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) small enough, our improvement over all previous methods can be up to a factor \(n\) in both query time and space. The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm, which can easily be implemented in existing software packages." />

  <p><p>A Locality-Sensitive Hash (LSH) function is called
\((r,cr,p_1,p_2)\)-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than \(r\)
collide with probability at least \(p_1\) while data points with a distance
greater than \(cr\) collide with probability at most \(p_2\). These functions form
the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest
neighbour problems. In particular one may build a \(c\)-approximate nearest
neighbour data structure with query time \(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1)\) where
\(\rho=\frac{log1/p_1}{log1/p_2}\in(0,1)\). That is, sub-linear time, as long
as \(p_1\) is not too small. This is significant since most high dimensional
nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can’t
be solved exact, faster than a brute force linear-time scan of the database.
  Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision
probabilities, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\). Including the best functions for Cosine and
Jaccard Similarity. This means that the \(n^\rho/p_1\) query time of LSH is often
not sub-linear after all, even for approximate nearest neighbours!
  In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the
query time of LSH to \(\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1^{1-\rho})\) (and the space usage
correspondingly.) Since \(n^\rho p_1^{\rho-1} &lt; n \Leftrightarrow p_1 &gt; n^{-1}\),
our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision
probabilities at least \(1/n\). For \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) small enough, our improvement
over all previous methods can be <em>up to a factor \(n\)</em> in both query time
and space.
  The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm,
which can easily be implemented in existing software packages.</p>
