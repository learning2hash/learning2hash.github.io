<meta name="description" content="Cross-model retrieval has emerged as one of the most important upgrades for text-only search engines (SE). Recently, with powerful representation for pairwise text-image inputs via early interaction, the accuracy of vision-language (VL) transformers has outperformed existing methods for text-image retrieval. However, when the same paradigm is used for inference, the efficiency of the VL transformers is still too low to be applied in a real cross-modal SE. Inspired by the mechanism of human learning and using cross-modal knowledge, this paper presents a novel Vision-Language Decomposed Transformer (VLDeformer), which greatly increases the efficiency of VL transformers while maintaining their outstanding accuracy. By the proposed method, the cross-model retrieval is separated into two stages: the VL transformer learning stage, and the VL decomposition stage. The latter stage plays the role of single modal indexing, which is to some extent like the term indexing of a text SE. The model learns cross-modal knowledge from early-interaction pre-training and is then decomposed into an individual encoder.

  <p><p>Cross-model retrieval has emerged as one of the most important upgrades for
text-only search engines (SE). Recently, with powerful representation for
pairwise text-image inputs via early interaction, the accuracy of
vision-language (VL) transformers has outperformed existing methods for
text-image retrieval. However, when the same paradigm is used for inference,
the efficiency of the VL transformers is still too low to be applied in a real
cross-modal SE. Inspired by the mechanism of human learning and using
cross-modal knowledge, this paper presents a novel Vision-Language Decomposed
Transformer (VLDeformer), which greatly increases the efficiency of VL
transformers while maintaining their outstanding accuracy. By the proposed
method, the cross-model retrieval is separated into two stages: the VL
transformer learning stage, and the VL decomposition stage. The latter stage
plays the role of single modal indexing, which is to some extent like the term
indexing of a text SE. The model learns cross-modal knowledge from
early-interaction pre-training and is then decomposed into an individual
encoder. The decomposition requires only small target datasets for supervision
and achieves both \(1000+\) times acceleration and less than \(0.6\)% average
recall drop. VLDeformer also outperforms state-of-the-art visual-semantic
embedding methods on COCO and Flickr30k.</p>
